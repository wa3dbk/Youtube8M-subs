hours<00:02:16.959> or<00:02:17.230> overnight<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.609> just<00:02:18.879> use<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
hours or overnight you can just use a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.660 
hours or overnight you can just use a
ziploc<00:02:19.659> bag<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.200> shake<00:02:20.439> it<00:02:20.499> it's<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.249> easier

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
ziploc bag and shake it it's much easier

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.720 
ziploc bag and shake it it's much easier
just<00:02:22.180> shake<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.659> bag<00:02:22.900> once<00:02:23.290> or<00:02:23.530> twice<00:02:23.829> so<00:02:24.549> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
just shake the bag once or twice so the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.629 
just shake the bag once or twice so the
marinade<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.810> evenly<00:02:26.260> distributed<00:02:26.620> among<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
water for about one hour so to prevent

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.140 
water for about one hour so to prevent
it<00:02:35.319> from<00:02:35.349> burning<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:36.310> says<00:02:36.519> I'm<00:02:36.669> going<00:02:36.849> bake
