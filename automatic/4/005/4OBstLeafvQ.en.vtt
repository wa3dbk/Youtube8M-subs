respond back in the respond point and

respond back in the respond point and
this<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.900> ties<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:20.070> the

this pretty much ties in with all the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.480 
this pretty much ties in with all the
respondents<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.470> survivors<00:01:22.490> obviously

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
respondents how the survivors obviously

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580

they<00:01:23.790> died<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> their<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
they died and this is their way of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.760 
they died and this is their way of
pretty<00:01:26.580> much<00:01:26.759> explaining<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.380> survivors

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
pretty much explaining one the survivors

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.640 
pretty much explaining one the survivors
died<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.369> happens<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:31.079> myself

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
died what happens to them and I myself

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
died what happens to them and I myself
think<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> through<00:01:32.520> time<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.000> he<00:01:33.180> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
think it is through time that he is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.969 
think it is through time that he is
reversing<00:01:33.960> time<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> quotes<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
reversing time from the quotes that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.520 
reversing time from the quotes that
we've<00:01:35.250> seen<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.579> cutscene<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.320> if<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
we've seen in the cutscene and if it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.870 
we've seen in the cutscene and if it's
through<00:01:37.680> space<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.490> doesn't<00:01:38.759> make<00:01:38.820> sense

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
through space it doesn't make sense

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
through space it doesn't make sense
because<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.170> reversed<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
because when it's reversed it's like a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
because when it's reversed it's like a
deja<00:01:41.310> vu<00:01:41.670> moment<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.150> them<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.890> even

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
deja vu moment for them they even

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
deja vu moment for them they even

marlton says that it seems like we've

traveling<00:01:49.170> through<00:01:49.380> space<00:01:50.240> will<00:01:51.240> give<00:01:51.720> them<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
traveling through space will give them a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.030 
traveling through space will give them a
deja<00:01:53.009> vu<00:01:53.399> moment<00:01:53.930> but<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.200> seems<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.530> Max's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
deja vu moment but it seems like Max's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
deja vu moment but it seems like Max's

but<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> guys<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
but what do you guys think this is all

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.719 
but what do you guys think this is all
up<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.630> theories<00:02:06.630> right<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:08.550> don't

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
up for theories right now and we don't

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
up for theories right now and we don't
know<00:02:08.819> much<00:02:08.970> yet<00:02:09.319> people<00:02:10.319> are<00:02:10.440> saying<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> die

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
know much yet people are saying that die

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.070 
know much yet people are saying that die
rise<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.700> transit<00:02:12.209> are<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.569> right<00:02:12.930> after

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
rise and transit are not right after

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.040 
rise and transit are not right after
each<00:02:13.410> other

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
each other

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.390 
each other
we<00:02:14.140> know<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> nuketown<00:02:14.860> happened<00:02:15.250> right

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
we know that nuketown happened right

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.730 
we know that nuketown happened right
before<00:02:15.430> transit<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.540> marlton<00:02:16.990> but<00:02:17.230> we

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
before transit because of marlton but we

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.330 
before transit because of marlton but we
don't<00:02:17.920> know<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.100> die<00:02:18.250> rise<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.730> after<00:02:19.210> um

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
don't know if die rise is after um

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.140 
don't know if die rise is after um
transit<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:21.810> before<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.470> could<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:24.000> before<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
transit or before it could be before it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.820 
transit or before it could be before it
could<00:02:25.240> be<00:02:25.390> way<00:02:25.570> after<00:02:25.960> there<00:02:26.260> could<00:02:26.380> be<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> map

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
could be way after there could be a map

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.520 
could be way after there could be a map
in<00:02:27.040> between<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.090> I'm<00:02:28.210> thinking<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
in between that's what I'm thinking I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.870 
in between that's what I'm thinking I
think<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.130> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.240> map<00:02:31.680> before

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
think there is going to be a map before

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.630 
think there is going to be a map before
