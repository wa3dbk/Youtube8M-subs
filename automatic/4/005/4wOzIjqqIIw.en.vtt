00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
such a tiny little tent for one was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
such a tiny little tent for one was
money<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> save<00:01:48.030> money<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.960> thought

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
money just to save money and I thought

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
money just to save money and I thought
it<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.320> cool<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.070> had<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.520> tiny<00:01:50.790> tent

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it was cool and I had a little tiny tent

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
it was cool and I had a little tiny tent
when<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> kid<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.560> thought<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.829> would

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
when I was a kid and I thought it would

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.789 
when I was a kid and I thought it would
be<00:01:53.040> fun<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:54.000> kids<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:55.079> second<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:55.740> I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
be fun for my kids but second of all I

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.330 
be fun for my kids but second of all I
figured<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.479> smaller<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.189> would

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
figured if it was smaller that it would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
figured if it was smaller that it would
maintain<00:01:59.759> my<00:02:00.119> body<00:02:00.390> heat<00:02:00.750> better<00:02:01.530> than<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
maintain my body heat better than if I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.149 
maintain my body heat better than if I
got<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> big<00:02:02.610> tent<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:04.079> lots<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.530> vents<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
got a big tent with lots of vents in it

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
so yeah I pretty much picked a

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.630 
so yeah I pretty much picked a
challenging<00:06:29.940> night<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.420> start<00:06:31.460> sleep<00:06:32.460> into

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
challenging night and start sleep into

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.480 
challenging night and start sleep into
this<00:06:32.790> tiny<00:06:33.090> little<00:06:33.210> tent<00:06:33.660> out<00:06:33.840> here<00:06:34.190> but<00:06:35.190> I

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
this tiny little tent out here but I

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.340 
this tiny little tent out here but I
guess<00:06:36.030> if<00:06:36.210> I'm<00:06:36.360> gonna<00:06:36.480> do<00:06:36.660> it<00:06:36.810> I<00:06:36.870> got<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.140> do<00:06:37.260> it

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
guess if I'm gonna do it I got to do it

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.140 
guess if I'm gonna do it I got to do it
all<00:06:37.470> the<00:06:37.500> way<00:06:37.680> right<00:06:39.170> well<00:06:40.170> no<00:06:41.150> I'd

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
all the way right well no I'd

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.960 
all the way right well no I'd
guesstimate<00:06:42.890> it's<00:06:43.890> probably<00:06:44.310> what<00:06:44.550> 30

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
guesstimate it's probably what 30

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.430 
guesstimate it's probably what 30
degrees<00:06:48.140> Fahrenheit<00:06:49.340> 30<00:06:50.340> degrees<00:06:50.670> right<00:06:50.700> now

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
degrees Fahrenheit 30 degrees right now

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.990 
degrees Fahrenheit 30 degrees right now
