00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
part this hair is super full the density

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
part this hair is super full the density
is<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> medium<00:01:39.759> density<00:01:39.939> so<00:01:40.359> it's<00:01:40.479> about<00:01:40.539> 1<00:01:40.929> 10

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
is a medium density so it's about 1 10

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.480 
is a medium density so it's about 1 10
to<00:01:41.380> 1<00:01:41.590> 30<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.359> is<00:01:43.689> still<00:01:44.289> really<00:01:44.890> really

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
to 1 30 but it is still really really

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.419 
to 1 30 but it is still really really
full<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:47.409> I<00:01:47.530> can't<00:01:47.740> believe<00:01:47.829> how<00:01:48.039> full<00:01:48.249> this

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
full like I can't believe how full this

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.599 
full like I can't believe how full this
is<00:01:48.640> for<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.509> medium<00:01:50.049> density<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:51.369> looks

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
is for this medium density it looks

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.399 
is for this medium density it looks
really<00:01:52.030> really<00:01:52.390> natural<00:01:52.810> along<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.200> hairline

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
really really natural along the hairline

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.749 
really really natural along the hairline
and<00:01:54.420> again<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.840> does<00:01:56.109> have<00:01:56.259> baby<00:01:56.499> here<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.100> it

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
and again it does have baby here so it

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.550 
and again it does have baby here so it
gives<00:01:57.969> you<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.329> more<00:01:58.569> natural<00:01:59.079> effect

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
gives you that more natural effect

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.719 
gives you that more natural effect
anyway<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.770> only<00:02:02.950> thing<00:02:03.219> I<00:02:03.399> would<00:02:03.549> say<00:02:03.579> that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
anyway the only thing I would say that

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.249 
anyway the only thing I would say that
you<00:02:03.909> guys<00:02:04.119> might<00:02:04.329> have<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.600> worry<00:02:04.780> about<00:02:04.929> it

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
you guys might have to worry about it

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.139 
you guys might have to worry about it
maybe<00:02:05.649> matting<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.520> back<00:02:06.640> because<00:02:06.880> it's<00:02:07.060> a

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
maybe matting in the back because it's a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.910 
maybe matting in the back because it's a
long<00:02:07.390> week<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.410> means<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.680> hair<00:02:08.830> is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
long week so that means the hair is

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.370 
long week so that means the hair is
going<00:02:09.100> to
