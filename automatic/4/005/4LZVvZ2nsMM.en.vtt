00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.070
 hello to all show you success on 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.769
 call of duty ghost let's go live 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.929
 shows success it's yet I 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.259
 it's not bad when it's 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.480
 cake 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.129
 in the end it's the fall of the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.990
 place you have to go on the map a month 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.670
 of veterans so the goal is to go 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.140
 in this piece 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.840
 the little room that will show there no 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
 come on the game and not to get 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.110
 touch once only, ie 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
 beginning can make touch by the little 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.490
 explosion that will have the c4 but to true 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.540
 false the more you do touched a single 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.020
 times and damn everyone 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.429
 interior 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.469
 so I know that two grenades times 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.600
 it's so simple once you're fine 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.949
 farting you will go back the merry of 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.839
 easy easy grenade 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.879
 dating thirty seconds each time 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.469
 every time in asia after or put here 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.579
 backing slowly draws to 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.079
 all the time with two weapons pretty much 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 equivalent is best to see it 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.379
 not like that with a viewfinder like that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.960
 it's better you show me me 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.409
 I already had them I'm not even 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.299
 minute 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.120
 I saw on videos he liked that they 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.890
 had 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.049
 four grenades twenty four grenades 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.790
 flash I did not get there there was trouble 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.540
 to arrive 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 it's a bit boring because 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.320
 that you must not be touched 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.509
 only once will you go slowly 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.670
 like this is it to launch the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.430
 first pomegranate dating from the thirties 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.110
 seconds here you are cleaning a 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.229
 little there for europe that stuck to 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.430
 to pass and you must not be touched 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.430
 only once if you ever do or 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.470
 with us to start you do 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.780
 last checkpoint and there you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.979
 swing more possible the small hole 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.479
 cowboys the wii 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.410
 there we must swing the load 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.340
 completely offered well households 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.550
 take care of all the others after if 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.970
 you get to do well what it takes 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.970
 perform on a motorcycle 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.240
 super simple frankly thought that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.830
 it was hard at the beginning and in the end 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.970
 the project no more videos what 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.160
 I saw our video the mails make 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.080
 anything and they were at least 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.350
 five minutes to make hyper success 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.350
 to choose 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.890
 we are a weapon that does not move too much for 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.890
 to counter 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.980
 they are while the block is the host 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.630
 during the famous far too much I had 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.069
 not have to take her this weapon can get 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.230
 reload on the side makes you that 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.530
 like that and it works towards success 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.530
 people 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.230
 no longer missing that I think 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.230
 that's the colleague 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.569
 with hear them again larry paul you are 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.569
 the last 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.150
 just now I do not even 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.380
 one minute 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.360
 that's not what they want 1 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.070
 that's it's good it's good they are 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.240
 all dead here is no one I am 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.700

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.360
 yes I am a young disabled people 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 that was to explain the success 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.180
 there because it is the fall 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.680
