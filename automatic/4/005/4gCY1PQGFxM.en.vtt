somewhere<00:01:52.210> between<00:01:52.390> 5<00:01:52.899> DD<00:01:53.289> and<00:01:53.560> 70<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.610> in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
somewhere between 5 DD and 70 so in

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.700 
somewhere between 5 DD and 70 so in
theory<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.210> should<00:01:55.240> have<00:01:55.600> some<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> good

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710
