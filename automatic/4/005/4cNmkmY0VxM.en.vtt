00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.850
 a huge hello to everyone today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.330
 make a video as promised about hair on 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.870
 tresses and their benefits and think video 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 later to take off but the strong has not won back 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 in general, I am sick and afraid that I will end 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 weeks can generally remain without a voice 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.090
 because in the morning I don't have it at all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.619
 what basically if you're interested in it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.330
 video then please stay with me 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.439
 and all enjoy watching 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.449
 and now I'll tell you about the pros and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.630
 minuses for me personally because 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.090
 everyone I think they will be his but 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010
 in my version what can I say about 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.690
 pros 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.780
 plus of course, of course, is that if 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 you have short hair and you do not want 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 build or not, for whatever opportunity 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.989
 the reasons then hair tress it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 really is salvation because 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 what can you do when you want 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.510
 longer when you want to wear your 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.949
 an ordinary hairstyle this hair I ordered 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.180
 on the site iherb.com I will leave it below and 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 I ordered them at that time in order 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 so when we were doing some 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 collaborations such as star imagery 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.830
 I do mila kunis she has long hair 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 I have that time was done and punishment 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 for was not problematic enough 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 enter fully into the image had somehow 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 get out of my hair if I have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.350
 that moment there was at least this hair 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
 it was much easier on the hairpins 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 what can I say for the quality of this hair 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 i have this indian hair they somehow 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.979
 are called rome 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 Indian women in my opinion so they are called 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.000
 very good quality they are absolutely not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.659
 different from my real hair 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.060
 because well here I when put them on 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.860
 compared there is no difference at all 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.740
 the only thing I don't like about these 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 hair that tress i am very good 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 feel on my head unlike 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.939
 the capsule that I have right now these 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.219
 here are the strips that is you need to have a very 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 very large hair volume and to hide 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.360
 these strips because when you them 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.460
 attach to the back of the head 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.720
 there but not knowing my hair 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.850
 constantly sharing here 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 like in two parts and if you don't do bouffant 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.170
 then this strip will be very visible by 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 least it was so with me and on 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
 how much really have thick hair 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.160
 In fact, all the time the hairdresser is given a diva 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.290
 says that we have so many x3 wives there and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.190
 you are always very very good volume 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.380
 hair density 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.630
 I have for example this hair with hairpins 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.030
 you can see them of course you can use on 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.650
 some celebration event but in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 everyday life i don't wear them 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.890
 I agree because I was here I like 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 this effect 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.100
 I came to me in the set 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.070
 it means two such triple strands 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.290
 here they are then three double and 2 odnushki 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.680
 I mix all turn out to be 7 to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 be 7 but the times are not quite enough for me 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.010
 thick hair 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.040
 because of my hair 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.870
 then measles were trimmed then this one 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.510
 transition due to the fact that not enough for me 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.020
 the volume is very visible and I will attach 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.020
 we then 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.269
 I do nâ€™t attach a sound to the side 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.220
 I already just shot such a small file 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.120
 this video put on hair and you will see 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.040
 As you can see , this difference, that is, I myself 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.840
 guilty that I ordered is not the amount I 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.140
 contacted the site they wrote them 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.880
 said yes you chose the wrong volume and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.769
 it was necessary to take more I remember chose 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.540
 the least and even if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.940
 may be the shortest hair 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.160
 which were there 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.950
 as for fasteners, they are beautiful 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.080
 Generally attached, you can not be afraid that 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.600
 somewhere you fall there and during the day 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.709
 Now I will show you on the example of two 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.670
 these single strands are these strands 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.290
 fasten here that is close with the face 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:00.720
 you wear it like this 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:03.120
 and button as you see and and further 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.360
 imperceptibly it seems to me i'm even perfect 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.350
 the color is horrible because on the site of course 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.660
 hard to choose there all the pictures could not 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.030
 know with flash there taking pictures either 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.400
 no flash is certainly not very convenient 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.699
 and now wear because I have 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 from the capsule in general they are very very simple 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:26.000
 in use and this is how it looks 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.889
 the entire head, I said as I fasten 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.389
 no you attached to you below so well 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.389
 what this hair looks like to me 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.520
 it seems natural enough and that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.460
 the most interesting i got into color though i 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.949
 I thought I wondered because we were there 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.780
 a lot of different variations and maybe 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.880
 it will be hard enough to guess when 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.979
 damn it okay and when such 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.110
 with some reddish undertone with 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.090
 brown it is already more 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.919
 problematic and i think it's in 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.770
 In principle, an inexpensive option because 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.740
 my hair cost me around 50 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.990
 dollars or 54 dollars i will leave you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.090
 coupon code that you can use 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.979
 order this hair is cheaper either by 10 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.449
 I don't remember exactly 20 percent 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.419
 but it seems to me it's still enough 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.610
 good discount for the quality I vouch 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.669
 because hair quality is really 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.400
 very good they are absolutely not at all 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.310
 different from my real hair 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.800
 That's how they look very good 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.740
 just right surprisingly cool so 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.389
 so girls I hope my opinion was 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.210
 useful for you if you have any 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.560
 then questions about the site 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.960
 Representatives of this site, I'm Theresa 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.090
 contacted her so if you want 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.039
 find out how much hair you need there 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.740
 or something you can ask her she 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.789
 answers she writes in english but it 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.550
 always can through google translate 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.320
 translate this no problem so 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.699
 what's waiting for your comments and 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.510
 see you in the next video bye 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:03.280
 as my grandmother says, how am I to you 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.280
 when my husband is on a business trip 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:18.810
 how do you generally understand you today 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.810
 I want to tell you about hair on tresses
