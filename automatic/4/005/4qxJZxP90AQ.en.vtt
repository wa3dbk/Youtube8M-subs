the inside and yeah the reviews on this
are<00:00:34.860> pretty<00:00:35.190> ridiculous<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.930> power<00:00:37.170> delivery

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
are pretty ridiculous the power delivery

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.810 
are pretty ridiculous the power delivery
is<00:00:37.590> pretty<00:00:37.829> ridiculous<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.550> almost

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
is pretty ridiculous and it's almost

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010 
is pretty ridiculous and it's almost
always<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.950> 90%<00:00:40.950> efficient<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.629> there's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
always around 90% efficient so there's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
always around 90% efficient so there's
your<00:00:43.170> quick<00:00:43.290> review<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:44.100> let's<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.640> it

modular on the other side and I'm not

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
modular on the other side and I'm not
sure<00:01:03.719> how<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:03.989> were<00:01:04.500> able<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.129> much<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
sure how they were able to do as much as

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
sure how they were able to do as much as
they<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.760> did<00:01:05.880> fully<00:01:06.060> modular<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.979> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
they did they did fully modular and you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.399 
they did they did fully modular and you
know<00:01:08.070> they've<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> C<00:01:08.580> tonic<00:01:08.729> platform

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
know they've used the C tonic platform

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.359 
know they've used the C tonic platform
good-good<00:01:10.409> capacitors

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
good-good capacitors

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.730 
good-good capacitors
they've<00:01:11.909> rated<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.479> 40<00:01:12.810> degrees<00:01:13.200> Celsius

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

they've rated this at 40 degrees Celsius
operating<00:01:14.340> temperature<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.090> should<00:01:15.570> be

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
operating temperature but you should be

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.399 
operating temperature but you should be
able<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.070> 45<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.970> 46<00:01:18.780> 47<00:01:19.110> you

able to go I don't know 45 or 46 47 you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
able to go I don't know 45 or 46 47 you
know<00:01:19.530> maybe<00:01:19.799> even<00:01:20.040> 50<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> should

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
know maybe even 50 with this it should

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
know maybe even 50 with this it should
be<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.270> fine<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> they've<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.590> very

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
be just fine so they've been very

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.499 
be just fine so they've been very
conservative<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.580> far<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.150> goes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
conservative as far as that goes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.219 
conservative as far as that goes
it's<00:01:25.409> 80<00:01:25.500> plus<00:01:25.770> gold<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:28.080> talk

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's 80 plus gold and let's let's talk

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's 80 plus gold and let's let's talk
about<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> different<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.130> actually

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
about the different well that's actually

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.830 
about the different well that's actually
let's<00:01:29.520> talk<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> dimensions<00:01:30.570> first

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's talk about the dimensions first

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.399 
let's talk about the dimensions first
it's<00:01:31.530> 150<00:01:32.040> by<00:01:32.220> 170<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:32.970> 86<00:01:33.570> millimeters<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> in

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it's 150 by 170 by 86 millimeters and in

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's 150 by 170 by 86 millimeters and in
inches<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.710> 5.9<00:01:35.490> by<00:01:35.700> 6.7<00:01:36.479> by<00:01:37.280> 3.4<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
inches that's 5.9 by 6.7 by 3.4 it's a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
inches that's 5.9 by 6.7 by 3.4 it's a
pretty<00:01:39.180> standard<00:01:39.570> size<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.680> all

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
pretty standard size let's look at all

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
pretty standard size let's look at all
these<00:01:40.829> cables<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> 20<00:01:41.880> plus<00:01:41.970> 4<00:01:42.270> pin

cool

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
cool

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.880 
cool
now<00:02:13.080> let's<00:02:13.260> talk<00:02:13.350> about<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.620> different

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
now let's talk about the different

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.080 
now let's talk about the different
efficiencies<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:14.460> we're<00:02:14.550> gonna<00:02:14.640> pull

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
efficiencies and then we're gonna pull

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.580 
efficiencies and then we're gonna pull
this<00:02:15.180> thing<00:02:15.240> apart<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.870> really<00:02:16.320> take<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> good

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
this thing apart and really take a good

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.920 
this thing apart and really take a good
look<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.280> at<00:02:18.000> everything<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.750> about

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
look at it now at everything up to about

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.460 
look at it now at everything up to about
750<00:02:19.710> watts<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.580> hovers<00:02:21.210> around<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.170> sometimes

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
750 watts it hovers around and sometimes

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890 
750 watts it hovers around and sometimes
it<00:02:22.560> gets<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.890> 91%<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.330> really

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it gets up to 91% so it's like really

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.980 
it gets up to 91% so it's like really
efficient<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> way<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.460> 750<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.420> then

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
efficient all the way up to 750 and then

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.620 
efficient all the way up to 750 and then
even<00:02:28.350> at<00:02:28.530> max<00:02:28.770> load<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.310> 88%<00:02:29.730> efficient<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
even at max load it is 88% efficient I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
even at max load it is 88% efficient I
only<00:02:30.990> get<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> very<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.460> very<00:02:32.850> good<00:02:33.030> gold

here do it gold all day so that's really

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.090 
here do it gold all day so that's really
cool<00:02:39.110> let's<00:02:40.110> take<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.290> apart<00:02:40.500> take<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.920> look<00:02:41.040> on

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
cool let's take it apart take a look on

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.250 
cool let's take it apart take a look on
the<00:02:41.220> inside<00:02:41.570> as<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.050> there's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the inside as you can see there there's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.280 
the inside as you can see there there's
that<00:02:43.470> nice<00:02:43.890> see<00:02:44.670> Sonic<00:02:45.030> platform<00:02:45.570> used<00:02:46.200> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that nice see Sonic platform used to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.680 
that nice see Sonic platform used to
power<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.530> lot<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> other<00:02:47.520> similar<00:02:48.120> power

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
power a lot of the other similar power

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.510 
power a lot of the other similar power
supplies<00:02:48.990> from<00:02:49.170> different<00:02:49.470> vendors<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.370> one

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
supplies from different vendors this one

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.500 
supplies from different vendors this one
they've<00:02:50.640> done<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> hell<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> job<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
they've done a hell of a job the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.160 
they've done a hell of a job the
soldering<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.770> clean<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:54.170> mine

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
soldering is really clean like mine

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
soldering is really clean like mine
hurting<00:02:55.830> clay<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.160> don't<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.580> who<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:56.790> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
hurting clay I don't know who I think I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
hurting clay I don't know who I think I
think<00:02:57.390> each<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.720> these<00:02:57.780> must<00:02:58.020> have<00:02:58.050> been

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
think each one of these must have been

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
think each one of these must have been
done<00:02:58.380> by<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.709> solder<00:02:59.670> master

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
done by like solder master

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.290 
done by like solder master
I<00:03:00.360> think<00:03:01.140> solder<00:03:01.350> master<00:03:01.709> Steve<00:03:02.030> now<00:03:03.030> if<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
I think solder master Steve now if you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.580 
I think solder master Steve now if you
look<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> capacitors<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.260> those<00:03:04.380> they're

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
look at the capacitors and those they're

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.860 
look at the capacitors and those they're
all<00:03:04.709> nippon<00:03:05.610> chemi-con<00:03:05.880> capacitors<00:03:06.600> except

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
all nippon chemi-con capacitors except

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.020 
all nippon chemi-con capacitors except
you<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.080> few<00:03:07.320> itachi<00:03:07.820> capacitors<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
you have a few itachi capacitors on the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.060 
you have a few itachi capacitors on the
main<00:03:09.240> filters<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.080> everything<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:11.040> is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
main filters but everything in there is

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.240 
main filters but everything in there is
Japanese<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.300> high-quality<00:03:12.780> capacitors<00:03:13.590> so

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
Japanese all high-quality capacitors so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.420 
Japanese all high-quality capacitors so
that's<00:03:15.060> good<00:03:15.300> as<00:03:15.480> well<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.100> bottom<00:03:17.400> line

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
