doesn't<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.010> much<00:01:08.189> propulsion<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> lift

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
doesn't take much propulsion to lift

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.620 
doesn't take much propulsion to lift
them<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> ground<00:01:10.220> there's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.630> working

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
them off the ground there's a working

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.609 
them off the ground there's a working
vehicle<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.939> this<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> 70s<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
vehicle there is this back in the 70s I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.240 
vehicle there is this back in the 70s I
guess<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.159> 60s<00:01:18.229> there's<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> flight<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
guess or 60s there's one in flight the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
guess or 60s there's one in flight the

and here's another one figure six the
Dyne<00:01:34.439> airship<00:01:35.240> notice<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> size<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.810> those

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
Dyne airship notice the size of those

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.020 
Dyne airship notice the size of those
trucks<00:01:37.320> next<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.340> big<00:01:38.610> triangular<00:01:39.119> craft

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030

trucks next to this big triangular craft
okay<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.570> turn<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.840> page<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.649> pages<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay just turn the page these pages are

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.880 
okay just turn the page these pages are
torn<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> talks<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
torn out but so talks about the the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.210 
torn out but so talks about the the
approach<00:01:50.189> used<00:01:51.020> preparation<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.220> displays

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
approach used preparation of displays

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.690 
approach used preparation of displays
which<00:01:53.700> follow

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.150 

this<00:01:58.700> off<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.210> can<00:01:59.590> do<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.680> there<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:00.890> read

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
this off so you can do it there and read

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:11.970 
this off so you can do it there and read
if<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:08.649> okay<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.640> goes<00:02:10.820> over<00:02:10.850> here

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
if you like okay and it goes over here

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.710 
if you like okay and it goes over here
it<00:02:12.980> shows<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.550> ship<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:15.170> compared<00:02:16.570> with<00:02:17.570> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
it shows the ship there compared with a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.240 
it shows the ship there compared with a
don't<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:20.960> type<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.140> plane<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.740> is

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
don't know what type of plane that is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.700 
don't know what type of plane that is
but<00:02:22.790> there<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> other<00:02:25.640> page<00:02:26.030> here

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
but there is one on the other page here

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.330 
but there is one on the other page here
that<00:02:27.710> shows<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.370> compared<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:30.220> 747<00:02:31.220> I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that shows that compared to a 747 I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.210 
that shows that compared to a 747 I
believe<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.360> shows<00:02:32.980> some<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
believe this shows some of the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.949 
believe this shows some of the
aerodynamic<00:02:36.970> scientific<00:02:37.970> stuff<00:02:39.340> speeds<00:02:40.340> and

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
aerodynamic scientific stuff speeds and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.410 
aerodynamic scientific stuff speeds and
overall<00:02:41.959> length<00:02:42.940> up<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.170> thousand<00:02:45.170> feet<00:02:46.510> okay

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
overall length up to thousand feet okay

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.240 
overall length up to thousand feet okay
and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:50.630> here's<00:02:51.230> what<00:02:51.500> they<00:02:51.650> want<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> use<00:02:52.070> it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
and then here's what they want to use it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.090 
and then here's what they want to use it
for<00:02:52.630> days<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:53.959> research<00:02:54.800> surveillance<00:02:57.100> phase

I<00:03:06.590> guess<00:03:07.100> they<00:03:07.280> skipped<00:03:07.640> all<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.880> because<00:03:08.750> it

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
I guess they skipped all that because it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.940 
I guess they skipped all that because it
just<00:03:09.290> went<00:03:09.560> straight<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:11.739> probably<00:03:12.739> phase

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
just went straight to probably phase

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.900 
just went straight to probably phase

parrot's putting in a few words

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.560
