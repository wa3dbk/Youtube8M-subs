well we even see the ear cups move on
all<00:02:52.170> axis<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.639> ensures<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.359> get

both arms for different size heads and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.879 
both arms for different size heads and
it<00:03:02.489> all<00:03:02.609> works<00:03:02.849> extremely<00:03:03.299> well<00:03:03.889> build

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
it all works extremely well build

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.250 
it all works extremely well build
quality<00:03:05.129> seems<00:03:05.609> good<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.359> only<00:03:06.720> negative<00:03:07.139> I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
quality seems good the only negative I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.649 
quality seems good the only negative I
would<00:03:07.290> say<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.549> material<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:09.299> on

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
would say is that this material just on

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.629 
would say is that this material just on
the<00:03:09.900> sort<00:03:10.439> of<00:03:10.470> bottom<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:10.980> headband<00:03:11.370> arm

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
the sort of bottom of the headband arm

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.539 
the sort of bottom of the headband arm
here<00:03:12.090> although<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:13.109> mechanism<00:03:13.319> feels<00:03:14.040> okay

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
here although the mechanism feels okay

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.089 
here although the mechanism feels okay
this<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.420> feels<00:03:15.569> like<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> cheap<00:03:16.230> plasticky

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
this just feels like a cheap plasticky

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.129 
this just feels like a cheap plasticky
material<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.849> think<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.359> just<00:03:18.389> could<00:03:18.689> have<00:03:18.810> done

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
material I think I just could have done

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.379 
material I think I just could have done
a<00:03:19.170> little<00:03:19.409> bit<00:03:19.590> better<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.609> material<00:03:21.239> they

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
a little bit better on the material they

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.819 
a little bit better on the material they
