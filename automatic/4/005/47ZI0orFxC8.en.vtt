00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.019 
think it is and really this is the point
in<00:00:13.300> the<00:00:13.390> game<00:00:13.420> where<00:00:14.310> if<00:00:15.310> this<00:00:15.580> were<00:00:15.700> a<00:00:15.730> horror

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
in the game where if this were a horror

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.850 
in the game where if this were a horror
movie<00:00:16.090> you<00:00:16.750> would<00:00:16.840> be<00:00:16.990> asking<00:00:17.260> yourself<00:00:17.620> why

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
movie you would be asking yourself why

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.330 
movie you would be asking yourself why

just<00:00:21.340> I<00:00:21.520> don't<00:00:21.580> remember<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:22.030> game<00:00:22.150> being

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
just I don't remember the game being

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.720 
just I don't remember the game being
that<00:00:22.539> good<00:00:22.690> beyond<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.619> point<00:00:23.830> it's<00:00:24.460> got<00:00:24.640> to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
that good beyond this point it's got to

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.330 
that good beyond this point it's got to
be<00:00:24.789> pretty<00:00:24.970> repetitive<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.780> I<00:00:25.900> think<00:00:26.340> boring

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
you're trying to actually make a video

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.850 
you're trying to actually make a video
that's<00:01:36.670> interesting<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.180> watch<00:01:37.300> all<00:01:37.930> right

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
here we go so we have another forest /

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.290 
here we go so we have another forest /
jungle<00:01:45.850> level<00:01:46.120> here<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:48.120> like<00:01:49.120> I<00:01:49.240> said

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
jungle level here and like I said

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.670 
jungle level here and like I said
they're<00:01:49.510> all<00:01:49.600> pretty<00:01:50.020> much<00:01:50.170> gonna<00:01:50.470> look

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
they're all pretty much gonna look

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.310 
they're all pretty much gonna look
exactly<00:01:51.220> like<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.870> for<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.990> rest<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.230> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
exactly like this for the rest of the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.820 
exactly like this for the rest of the
game<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.970> too<00:01:55.120> bad<00:01:55.150> because<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:56.740> if

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
game which is too bad because really if

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.050 
game which is too bad because really if
there<00:01:56.950> could<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.160> been<00:01:57.310> just<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.700> little<00:01:57.730> bit

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
there could have been just a little bit

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.370 
there could have been just a little bit
more<00:01:58.240> variety<00:01:58.450> i<00:01:58.780> think<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.140> would<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.320> been

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
more variety i think it would have been

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.720 
more variety i think it would have been
a<00:01:59.440> really<00:01:59.560> good<00:01:59.740> game<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:02.010> that's<00:02:03.010> that's<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
a really good game and that's that's the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.640 
a really good game and that's that's the
thing<00:02:03.880> i<00:02:03.940> haven't<00:02:04.120> really<00:02:04.300> talked<00:02:05.260> about<00:02:05.500> too

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
thing i haven't really talked about too

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.500 
thing i haven't really talked about too
much<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.980> is<00:02:06.100> actually<00:02:06.340> whether<00:02:07.120> or<00:02:07.210> not<00:02:07.300> this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
much it is actually whether or not this

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.780 
much it is actually whether or not this
is<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.720> fun<00:02:07.990> game<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.260> play<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.610> is

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
game which is not surprising because

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.760 
game which is not surprising because
it's<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.240> great<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.990> don't<00:05:10.260> think<00:05:10.680> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
it's not that great and I don't think it

it's not that great and I don't think it
really<00:05:10.800> sold<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.400> well<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:12.419> lot<00:05:12.450> of

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
should have stopped it after that last

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.610

but<00:06:44.050> yeah<00:06:46.270> dr.<00:06:47.270> chaos<00:06:47.600> was<00:06:49.030> developed<00:06:50.030> by<00:06:50.180> a

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
but yeah dr. chaos was developed by a

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.920 
but yeah dr. chaos was developed by a
group<00:06:50.300> called<00:06:50.449> marionette<00:06:51.169> and<00:06:52.810> if<00:06:53.810> you're

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
group called marionette and if you're

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.330 
group called marionette and if you're
looking<00:06:54.199> at<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:54.530> game<00:06:54.710> and<00:06:54.919> you're<00:06:55.190> thinking

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
looking at the game and you're thinking

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.939 
looking at the game and you're thinking
well<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.900> graphics<00:06:57.289> look<00:06:57.410> kind<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.740> similar

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
well the graphics look kind of similar

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:59.560 
well the graphics look kind of similar
to<00:06:58.310> something<00:06:58.729> else<00:06:58.880> I<00:06:59.030> might<00:06:59.210> have<00:06:59.389> played

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
to something else I might have played

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.890 
to something else I might have played
before<00:07:00.639> that's<00:07:01.639> because<00:07:02.030> marionette<00:07:02.539> also

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
before that's because marionette also

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.480 
before that's because marionette also
developed<00:07:03.289> a<00:07:03.350> game<00:07:03.530> called<00:07:03.770> phantom<00:07:04.250> fighter

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
developed a game called phantom fighter

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.939 
developed a game called phantom fighter
which<00:07:05.449> was<00:07:05.660> also<00:07:05.930> coincidentally<00:07:06.289> released

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
which was also coincidentally released

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:14.230 
which was also coincidentally released
by<00:07:07.130> fci<00:07:07.630> in<00:07:08.630> the<00:07:08.810> United<00:07:09.110> States<00:07:12.610> although<00:07:13.610> I<00:07:13.789> I

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
by fci in the United States although I I

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.580 
by fci in the United States although I I
think<00:07:14.570> this<00:07:14.660> is<00:07:14.720> probably<00:07:14.930> a<00:07:15.110> better<00:07:15.229> game

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
think this is probably a better game

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.689 
think this is probably a better game
than<00:07:15.949> phantom<00:07:16.849> fighter<00:07:17.090> huh<00:07:18.550> remember<00:07:19.550> what

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
than phantom fighter huh remember what

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:25.120 
than phantom fighter huh remember what

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.350 

it's<00:07:26.130> probably<00:07:26.280> the<00:07:26.520> most<00:07:26.670> annoying<00:07:26.940> of<00:07:27.210> the

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360
