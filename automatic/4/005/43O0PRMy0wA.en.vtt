it's<00:01:53.310> great<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.210> had<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.990> did<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.439> an

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it's great you know I had I did have an

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.730 
it's great you know I had I did have an
MMA<00:01:56.280> fight<00:01:56.579> back<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.799> 2007<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.430> Hawaii

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
MMA fight back in 2007 in Hawaii

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.550 
MMA fight back in 2007 in Hawaii
and<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:01.159> knocked<00:02:01.490> around<00:02:02.049> 50<00:02:03.049> seconds

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
and I knocked around 50 seconds

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.830 
and I knocked around 50 seconds
something<00:02:03.890> like<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.690> know<00:02:05.720> I

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
something like that but you know I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.109 
something like that but you know I
decided<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.680> wasn't<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.130> sport<00:02:07.490> for<00:02:07.670> me<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.090> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
decided it wasn't the sport for me and I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.020 
decided it wasn't the sport for me and I
went<00:02:08.240> back<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.660> boxing<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.470> but<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.880> know<00:02:10.910> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
went back to boxing and but I you know I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.990 
went back to boxing and but I you know I
mean<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.450> think<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.110> great<00:02:12.380> um<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.880> know

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
mean I think that's great um you know

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.990 
mean I think that's great um you know
MMA<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:15.380> obviously<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.980> much<00:02:16.220> safer<00:02:16.490> sport

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
MMA is it's obviously a much safer sport

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080 
MMA is it's obviously a much safer sport
because<00:02:17.989> you're<00:02:18.170> not<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.709> 12<00:02:19.489> rounds<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
because you're not going 12 rounds I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.490 
because you're not going 12 rounds I
think<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.390> maximum<00:02:20.569> you're<00:02:21.050> going<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.319> spy

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
think the maximum you're going to spy

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.270 
think the maximum you're going to spy
grounds<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> gloves<00:02:24.709> are<00:02:24.950> much

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
grounds and and the gloves are much

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.380 
grounds and and the gloves are much
smaller<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> there's<00:02:28.010> less<00:02:28.160> brain<00:02:28.730> damage<00:02:29.180> as

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
smaller so there's less brain damage as

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.570 
smaller so there's less brain damage as
well<00:02:29.690> as<00:02:29.989> you're<00:02:30.560> spending<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.920> lot<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.100> time<00:02:31.220> on

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
well as you're spending a lot of time on

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.770 
well as you're spending a lot of time on
the<00:02:31.730> ground<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.510> lot<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.350> time<00:02:33.530> kicking<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.780> so

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the ground a lot of time kicking and so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.050 
the ground a lot of time kicking and so
you<00:02:35.840> don't<00:02:36.080> see<00:02:36.290> as<00:02:36.440> much<00:02:36.680> brain<00:02:36.980> damage<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you don't see as much brain damage that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.820 
you don't see as much brain damage that
you<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.420> boxing<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.080> obviously<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.620> it's

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
you do in boxing so obviously it's it's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.900 
you do in boxing so obviously it's it's
a<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:40.940> safer<00:02:41.300> sport<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:43.310> wounds<00:02:43.519> are<00:02:43.760> more

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
a it's a safer sport the wounds are more

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.290 
a it's a safer sport the wounds are more
superficial<00:02:44.600> rather<00:02:45.080> than<00:02:45.320> internal<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:47.269> I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
superficial rather than internal so I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.960 
superficial rather than internal so I
like<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.810> part<00:02:48.050> about<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.700> think

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
like that part about it and and I think

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.750 
like that part about it and and I think
it's<00:02:50.239> more<00:02:50.480> exciting<00:02:50.840> for<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> fans<00:02:51.760> even

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it's more exciting for the fans even

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.570 
it's more exciting for the fans even
though<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.300> prefer<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.989> see<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.500> long<00:02:54.950> strategic

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
though I prefer to see a long strategic

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.840 
though I prefer to see a long strategic
fight<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.900> know<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.050> like<00:02:57.320> Mayweather<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.160> lot

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
fight you know I like Mayweather a a lot

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.509 
fight you know I like Mayweather a a lot
of<00:02:58.970> fans<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.360> want<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.660> see<00:02:59.780> quick<00:03:00.019> knockouts

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
of fans just want to see quick knockouts

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.160 
of fans just want to see quick knockouts
so<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:02.180> got<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.540> when<00:03:02.660> you're<00:03:02.780> using<00:03:02.989> those

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
so you got one when you're using those

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.509 
so you got one when you're using those
smaller<00:03:03.410> gloves<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:03.950> must<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:04.250> been<00:03:04.340> like

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
smaller gloves that must have been like

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.770 
smaller gloves that must have been like
a<00:03:04.550> joy<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.790> be<00:03:05.000> able<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.209> hit<00:03:05.360> somebody<00:03:05.720> with

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
a joy to be able to hit somebody with

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.490 
a joy to be able to hit somebody with
small<00:03:06.079> gloves<00:03:06.380> now<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.540> know<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.170> not

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
small gloves now you know it's it's not

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.670 
small gloves now you know it's it's not
as<00:03:13.690> mundane<00:03:14.690> Juris<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.110> hit<00:03:15.290> someone<00:03:15.650> with

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
as mundane Juris to hit someone with

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.750 
as mundane Juris to hit someone with
with<00:03:16.570> boxing<00:03:17.570> gloves<00:03:17.810> only<00:03:18.350> because<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
with boxing gloves only because with the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.780 
with boxing gloves only because with the
smaller<00:03:20.060> gloves<00:03:20.480> being<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:21.380> small<00:03:21.709> your<00:03:22.250> risk

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
smaller gloves being so small your risk

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.060 
smaller gloves being so small your risk
for<00:03:23.980> breaking<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.070> hand<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.739> kind<00:03:28.010> of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
for breaking a hand and so it kind of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.860 
for breaking a hand and so it kind of
stops<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.519> from<00:03:28.549> putting<00:03:28.880> your<00:03:29.150> entire<00:03:29.480> body

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
stops you from putting your entire body

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.410 
stops you from putting your entire body
weight<00:03:30.260> into<00:03:30.739> it

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.430 

so<00:03:33.990> I<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.370> still<00:03:36.270> have<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.810> say<00:03:36.960> that<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.170> think

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so I I still have to say that I think

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.780 
so I I still have to say that I think
it's<00:03:38.130> safer

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
it's safer

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.330 
it's safer
the<00:03:39.120> smaller<00:03:39.450> gloves<00:03:39.810> then<00:03:40.110> then<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.860> boxing

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the smaller gloves then then the boxing

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
the smaller gloves then then the boxing
