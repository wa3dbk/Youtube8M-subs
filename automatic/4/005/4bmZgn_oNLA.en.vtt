skill<00:01:04.680> move<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> FIFA<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
skill move I use a lot in FIFA and I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
skill move I use a lot in FIFA and I
think<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.619> introduced<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.369> FIFA

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
think it actually got introduced in FIFA

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.609 
think it actually got introduced in FIFA
12<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.450> been<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.750> FIFA<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.229> quite<00:01:10.439> some

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
12 so it has been in FIFA for quite some

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
12 so it has been in FIFA for quite some
years<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.549> mentioned<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> skill<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
years but as I mentioned it is a skill I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
years but as I mentioned it is a skill I
use<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> FIFA<00:01:13.560> 15<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.520> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
use a lot of FIFA 15 I think it's it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
use a lot of FIFA 15 I think it's it's
really<00:01:15.060> effective<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.659> well<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.650> are

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really effective as well there are

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
really effective as well there are
actually<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.220> versions<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> elastico

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
actually two versions of the elastico

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually two versions of the elastico
chop<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.900> year<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> version<00:01:19.799> where

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
chop this year this is the version where

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
chop this year this is the version where
the<00:01:20.340> ball<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:20.880> close<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.450> feet<00:01:21.659> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the ball is pretty close to your feet so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
the ball is pretty close to your feet so
that<00:01:21.960> means<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.799> still<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.280> control<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that means you can still get control of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
that means you can still get control of
the<00:01:24.000> ball<00:01:24.150> after<00:01:24.540> pulling<00:01:24.720> off<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> skill

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the ball after pulling off the skill

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
the ball after pulling off the skill
move<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:25.979> basically<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.060> full

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
move and you can basically just go full

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
move and you can basically just go full
sprint<00:01:27.720> maybe<00:01:28.259> towards<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> goal<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sprint maybe towards the goal and just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
sprint maybe towards the goal and just
pull<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.820> again<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> maybe<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> rabona

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
pull it off again and maybe do a rabona

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
pull it off again and maybe do a rabona
shot<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.409> something<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> did<00:01:32.430> right

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shot or something just like I did right

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.420 
shot or something just like I did right
there<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.299> Ronaldinho<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> skill<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
there with Ronaldinho so it's a skill I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
there with Ronaldinho so it's a skill I
really<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.360> FIFA<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
really really do like in FIFA and I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
really really do like in FIFA and I
think<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.130> effective<00:01:38.670> as

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
think it is really really effective as

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
think it is really really effective as
well<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.840> move<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> other

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
well then we move on to the other

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
well then we move on to the other
version<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> called<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> alternative

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
version which is called the alternative

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
version which is called the alternative
elastico<00:01:43.049> chop<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.680> actually<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
elastico chop and that is actually a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
elastico chop and that is actually a
brand<00:01:44.490> new<00:01:44.700> skill<00:01:45.030> move<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.420> year<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.899> FIFA

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
brand new skill move this year in FIFA

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
brand new skill move this year in FIFA
15<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.000> different<00:01:48.299> if

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
15 it's a little bit more different if

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
15 it's a little bit more different if
you<00:01:48.750> compare<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.829> regular<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you compare this one to the regular one

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
you compare this one to the regular one
because<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> ball<00:01:51.060> goes<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:51.810> more

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
because the ball goes a little bit more

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
because the ball goes a little bit more
to<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> side<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:53.009> means<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:53.759> really

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to the side which means you don't really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.999 
to the side which means you don't really
get<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.420> much<00:01:54.720> control<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> ball<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.770> with

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
get as much control of the ball as with

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.370 
get as much control of the ball as with
the<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.969> yeah<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.840> also<00:01:58.020> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the first one so yeah this is also just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
the first one so yeah this is also just
one<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.969> although

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
one that I really do like although

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
one that I really do like although
sometimes<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.229> skill<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.009> really

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
sometimes this skill can get really

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
sometimes this skill can get really
really<00:02:02.549> annoying<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.750> order<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
really annoying because them in order to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
really annoying because them in order to
pull<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> skill<00:02:04.680> move<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.399> basically<00:02:05.850> have

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
pull the skill move you basically have

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789 
pull the skill move you basically have
to<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> exact<00:02:06.750> same<00:02:06.780> controls<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> can

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
to do the exact same controls as you can

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
to do the exact same controls as you can
see<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> screen<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
see on the screen but you also have to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.350 
see on the screen but you also have to
hold<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> left<00:02:10.470> trigger<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:11.069> Xbox<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.700> l2<00:02:11.910> on

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hold the left trigger on Xbox or l2 on

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
hold the left trigger on Xbox or l2 on
the<00:02:12.480> PlayStation<00:02:13.140> which<00:02:13.319> means

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the PlayStation which means

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
the PlayStation which means
if<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.460> pull<00:02:14.610> off<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.790> skill<00:02:15.090> move<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
if you pull off the skill move and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.390 
if you pull off the skill move and
you're<00:02:15.570> facing<00:02:15.870> an<00:02:16.140> opponent<00:02:16.230> your<00:02:17.100> player

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you're facing an opponent your player

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.060 
you're facing an opponent your player
will<00:02:17.700> most<00:02:17.970> likely<00:02:18.210> go<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.780> shielding<00:02:19.290> because

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
will most likely go in shielding because

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.980 
will most likely go in shielding because
I'm<00:02:20.310> EA<00:02:20.610> decided<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> put<00:02:21.240> shielding<00:02:21.660> back<00:02:21.810> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
I'm EA decided to put shielding back in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.020 
I'm EA decided to put shielding back in
FIFA<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.800> last<00:02:23.100> year<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.670> controls

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
FIFA I think last year and it controls

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510 
FIFA I think last year and it controls
up<00:02:24.180> basically<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.930> holding<00:02:25.260> l2<00:02:25.650> or<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.340> left

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
up basically just holding l2 or the left

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.190 
up basically just holding l2 or the left
trigger<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.570> something<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
trigger so that is something you have to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.660 
trigger so that is something you have to
keep<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.590> mind<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:29.040> you're<00:02:29.220> facing<00:02:29.460> an

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
keep in mind if you're facing an

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.280 
keep in mind if you're facing an
opponent<00:02:29.760> obviously<00:02:30.480> otherwise<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.080> won't

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
opponent obviously otherwise it won't

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
opponent obviously otherwise it won't
happen<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.800> yeah<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> would<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.000> recommend

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
happen so yeah I would just recommend

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
happen so yeah I would just recommend
trying<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.900> pull<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> off<00:02:34.560> really<00:02:34.860> really<00:02:34.950> fast

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
trying to pull it off really really fast

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
trying to pull it off really really fast
as<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.760> see<00:02:35.940> right<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.630> like<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
as you can see right there just like I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.840 
as you can see right there just like I
did<00:02:37.080> where<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.590> Ronaldinho<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.670> will

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
did where there with Ronaldinho it will

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.940 
did where there with Ronaldinho it will
obviously<00:02:39.210> take<00:02:39.450> some<00:02:39.870> time<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.500> practice

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
obviously take some time to to practice

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370 
obviously take some time to to practice
it<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.430> soon<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.240> get<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
it but as soon as you like get get the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.990 
it but as soon as you like get get the
hang<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:43.890> will<00:02:44.070> become<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.550> lot<00:02:44.850> easier

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
hang of it it will become a lot easier

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.730 
hang of it it will become a lot easier
for<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.570> guys<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.170> still<00:02:46.380> hope<00:02:46.560> though<00:02:46.709> that

for you guys I still hope though that
they<00:02:47.280> will<00:02:47.459> change<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.030> FIFA<00:02:48.420> 16<00:02:48.600> because

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
they will change it in FIFA 16 because

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.630 
they will change it in FIFA 16 because
sometimes<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:49.920> feels<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.370> bit

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
sometimes it just feels a little bit

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120

awkward<00:02:50.820> just<00:02:51.270> holding<00:02:51.660> l2<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.560> also<00:02:52.770> means

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
awkward just holding l2 which also means

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.530 
awkward just holding l2 which also means
