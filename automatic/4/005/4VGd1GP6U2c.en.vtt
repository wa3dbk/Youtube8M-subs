00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.030
 so I think I failed with my 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 The selection is still there 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.000
 have all of our 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.280
 the role of money that I 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.440
 I made the coins a while ago and it was 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.510
 a well-seen video that the staff asked 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.450
 very cheap paper is harder ours 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250
 here paper of $ 100 also 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.480
 so we managed to show a 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.600
 bit to you how are the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.720
 cash notes in the united states 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.150
 Come on, that one dollar bill that you have 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.830
 in the photo zinho and today I think so 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.670
 For those who do not know, it was the first 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:46.350
 I think President elect reports that she 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.190
 full of mysteries in writing another 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 her side 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.430
 this is the back of the note then 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 There are several kinds of freemasonry 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.650
 illuminatis references to the number 13 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.299
 which was the first three colonies 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.739
 united states brings the front of the 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.619
 dollar bill is easy for people 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.409
 get back to score of 2 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.670
 the Note 2 is a rarer little note as 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 I said that these were the first 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 notes that I got two is that no 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 Saturday in four years and little here has the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.380
 tomato jefferson was the third 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 American president and a leading 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 authors of the declaration of independence 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 American 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 on the back of it is the declaration of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.469
 american independence 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:41.250
 and that's the personal grade of 76 is 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.289
 difficult to circulate when staff picks up 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.719
 People got it and did not touch it. 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.929
 two notes of 2 that we picked up then 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.479
 it is difficult to go in a market with 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:55.799
 mars does not even have space for the note 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.880
 of 2 bahia 1 5 10 20 and 50 thus no 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 have 2 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.289
 so it's not but it's hard to find 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.289
 at the time it is little produced and little 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.490
 used then it is difficult to find 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.970
 automatic machines sometimes do not 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.830
 accept the grade of 2 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.580
 so much more little things she 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.770
 becomes a rarer Note 5 is the note 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.470
 out of 5 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.770
 in the image he was the 16th president of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.990
 U.S 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.860
 fight is now only give yet know 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.530
 One more new movie that came out of it, right? 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.770
 behind is the memorial of himself 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.470
 the linking memorial sitting there 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.810
 stay here in washington said the note 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.730
 5 in itself also a much used note 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.190
 will easily catch the hand going to the field 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.060
 green is wearing clothes of 10 to be 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.700
 faster 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 the note of 10 had research soon 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.730
 to know who is then from alexander hamilton 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.640
 he was the first secretary of the treasury 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.230
 american named by george washington 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.240
 she notices that the kitchen has more 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.500
 different a tone through the greater the dinho 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.030
 middle aged leading thus are only 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.840
 that our note 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.910
 if it's colorful it 's all colorful 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.950
 it follows a middle-of -the-day pattern 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.250
 light and such is that it is a bit more 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.500
 on the back of it has the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.190
 american treasure 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.190
 we go to Note 20 to Note 20 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.390
 dollars at the ATM and five 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.290
 20 in the hand of 20 for everything here 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.530
 research I did not know 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.820
 It's a jackson he was the seventh president. 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.640
 American 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:57.430
 on the back of the note of 20 has the white house 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:01.150
 the 50 note in the picture olices grande 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.260
 he was the 18th president of the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.260
 50 is the capitol 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:15.900
 fifty and a little to see you 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.900
 Video, let's go to the usual note. 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.760
 It was also difficult for us to get the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.560
 A hundred note have the image benjamin 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.440
 franklin and is also known this is 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.290
 easier to recognize and was one of the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.160
 leaders of the American Revolution 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.160
 in the back 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.060
 have hall independence she back of 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.810
 grades 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.419
 with the exception of a dollar it is very clean 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.789
 exactly does not have so much the image is etc. 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.479
 and as such help as short as the 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.050
 one dollar 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.849
 and to finish let all the votes 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.919
 all the notes 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.250
 besides these notes is that we already 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.819
 showed also had scores as 500 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.300
 thousand five thousand and ten thousand and 100 thousand dollars more 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.409
 it has not been printed since 1946 and 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.409
 she is already out of the market 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.330
 that's it knowing some of the notes 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.039
 Americans start the money notes 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.199
 the United States 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.650
 if you liked the jewelry it shares 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.650
 on the channel
