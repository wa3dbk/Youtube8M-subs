 I will add that the blue color is obtained 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 precisely from pink 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.320

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.160
 just such a fucking endless 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.890

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.360
 title in the very 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.670
 that the anode will also bloom 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.400
