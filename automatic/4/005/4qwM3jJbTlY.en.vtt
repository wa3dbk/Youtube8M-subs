00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the Recon looks a little feminine due to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.790 
the Recon looks a little feminine due to
the<00:00:43.710> fact<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> her<00:00:44.219> eyes<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:45.480> art<00:00:45.800> exploited

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the fact that her eyes not art exploited

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.080 
the fact that her eyes not art exploited
but<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.700> feminine

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but they just look a little feminine

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
but they just look a little feminine
because<00:00:48.590> guy<00:00:49.590> eyes<00:00:49.829> look<00:00:50.129> different<00:00:50.460> than

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
because guy eyes look different than

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580 
because guy eyes look different than
girl<00:00:50.760> eyes<00:00:50.940> obviously<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
girl eyes obviously and i think that the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
girl eyes obviously and i think that the
recorder<00:00:53.100> looks<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:53.940> feminine<00:00:54.239> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
recorder looks a little feminine just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
recorder looks a little feminine just
because<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.170> her<00:00:55.320> eyes<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.860> not

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
because the way her eyes look not

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
because the way her eyes look not
because<00:00:56.730> she's<00:00:56.910> Asian<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.690> she

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because she's Asian I just think she

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
because she's Asian I just think she
looks<00:00:57.809> feminine<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.530> her<00:00:59.250> body<00:00:59.489> type<00:00:59.730> is

and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> paint<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> face<00:01:40.530> might<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.950> hair

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and the paint on the face might be hair

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.080 
and the paint on the face might be hair
but<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.360> 95<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> ensure<00:01:43.259> its<00:01:43.409> paint<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
