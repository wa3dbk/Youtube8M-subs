hello everybody Marcus Chris here so
this<00:00:05.160> is<00:00:05.339> just<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.879> normal<00:00:06.680> girls<00:00:07.680> field

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
this is just the normal girls field

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.820 
this is just the normal girls field
except<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.530> leaver<00:00:11.130> over<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.530> let's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
except for a leaver over here so let's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
except for a leaver over here so let's
see<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.400> happens<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:31.309> staircase<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:34.850> yeah

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
see what happens so staircase and yeah

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.619 
see what happens so staircase and yeah
it's<00:00:36.030> expandable<00:00:37.969> as<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it's expandable as you can see it's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.310 
it's expandable as you can see it's
pretty<00:00:39.840> white<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:41.600> think<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.020> let<00:00:43.200> them

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
pretty white now I I think you let them

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
pretty white now I I think you let them
wide<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:46.469> wiring<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.129> pretty

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wide this one and the wiring is pretty

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.590 
wide this one and the wiring is pretty
huge<00:00:49.070> um<00:00:51.770> well<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:53.340> hard<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
huge um well it's pretty hard to do this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.520 
huge um well it's pretty hard to do this
actually<00:00:55.699> but<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
actually but it's also because there are

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
actually but it's also because there are
love<00:00:58.770> books<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> snapshot<00:01:02.449> I'll<00:01:03.449> show<00:01:03.690> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
love books in the snapshot I'll show you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
love books in the snapshot I'll show you
your<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> wiring<00:01:04.890> without<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> cross<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
your the wiring without the cross so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.940 
your the wiring without the cross so
this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.890> I'll<00:01:10.890> show<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:12.619> what<00:01:13.619> actually

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this is it I'll show you what actually

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:38.340 
this is it I'll show you what actually
happens

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.340 

so<00:01:39.350> it's<00:01:39.560> really<00:01:39.770> crazy<00:01:40.040> what<00:01:40.789> all<00:01:41.509> happens<00:01:42.140> to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
so it's really crazy what all happens to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.230 
so it's really crazy what all happens to
get<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:45.170> blocks<00:01:46.539> like<00:01:47.539> this<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.939> this

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
get just these blocks like this to this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.999 
get just these blocks like this to this
position<00:01:52.390> but<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.810> think<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.439> pretty<00:01:54.710> cool

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
position but I think it's pretty cool

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.029 
position but I think it's pretty cool
and<00:01:57.159> I<00:01:58.689> hope<00:01:59.689> they're<00:01:59.990> gonna<00:02:00.170> fix<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.740> lot<00:02:00.920> of

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
and I hope they're gonna fix a lot of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.460 
and I hope they're gonna fix a lot of
books<00:02:01.369> for<00:02:02.860> example<00:02:04.240> over<00:02:05.240> here<00:02:05.450> i<00:02:05.659> used<00:02:06.110> a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
books for example over here i used a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.779 
books for example over here i used a
redstone<00:02:07.840> decay<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.560> create<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> long<00:02:10.610> delay

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
redstone decay to create a long delay

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.449 
redstone decay to create a long delay
and<00:02:12.069> they<00:02:13.069> work<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.989> subscribe<00:02:14.989> mouth<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:16.130> on

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and they work on subscribe mouth but on

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.059 
and they work on subscribe mouth but on
this<00:02:17.360> mouth<00:02:18.099> sometimes<00:02:19.099> doesn't<00:02:19.700> work<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
this mouth sometimes doesn't work and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.210 
this mouth sometimes doesn't work and
also<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.340> can't<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:24.440> one-click<00:02:25.190> process

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
also you can't get a one-click process

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.710 
also you can't get a one-click process
through<00:02:25.880> torts<00:02:26.239> towers<00:02:28.239> which<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.450> also

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
through torts towers which is also

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.979 
through torts towers which is also
pretty<00:02:30.290> annoying<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:33.099> yeah<00:02:34.099> some<00:02:34.519> more<00:02:34.730> books

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
pretty annoying and yeah some more books

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.620 
pretty annoying and yeah some more books
for<00:02:35.989> example<00:02:36.609> if<00:02:37.609> you<00:02:37.760> power<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:39.730> best<00:02:40.730> i'll

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
for example if you power it best i'll

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.309 
for example if you power it best i'll
show<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.109> power<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.560> distant<00:02:46.130> like

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
show you if you power it distant like

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.770 
show you if you power it distant like
this<00:02:50.739> before<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.489> bottom<00:02:52.819> one<00:02:53.030> extended<00:02:53.540> and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
this before the bottom one extended and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.059 
this before the bottom one extended and
the<00:02:53.930> top<00:02:54.380> on<00:02:55.569> after<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.600> but<00:02:57.049> now<00:02:57.290> this

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
the top on after that but now this

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.009 
the top on after that but now this
happens<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> that's<00:03:01.400> also<00:03:01.670> something<00:03:02.060> so

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
happens so that's also something so

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.660 
happens so that's also something so
there<00:03:03.200> are<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.950> lot<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.250> books<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:05.000> i<00:03:06.670> managed

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
there are a lot of books that i managed

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.120 
there are a lot of books that i managed
to<00:03:08.380> make<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:11.420> think<00:03:11.660> it's<00:03:11.780> really<00:03:11.930> cool

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.019 

so<00:03:16.130> that's<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.870> thanks<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:17.989> watching
