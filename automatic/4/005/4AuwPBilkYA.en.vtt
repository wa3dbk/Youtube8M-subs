get right into this so let's start off
with<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.890> nighttime<00:00:38.340> shaders<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> can

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
with the nighttime shaders as you can

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
with the nighttime shaders as you can
see<00:00:39.390> everything<00:00:39.809> looks<00:00:39.840> cool<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.180> let<00:00:42.180> me

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
see everything looks cool and let me

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.959 
see everything looks cool and let me
turn<00:00:42.450> off<00:00:42.480> difficulty<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.680> die

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
turn off difficulty so I don't die

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.510 
turn off difficulty so I don't die
anyways<00:00:45.410> here's<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.710> shaders<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
anyways here's the shaders and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
anyways here's the shaders and
everything<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.690> during<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> night<00:00:49.440> time

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
everything this is during the night time

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
everything this is during the night time
as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:51.090> looks<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.809> realistic

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
as you can see it looks so realistic

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.490 
as you can see it looks so realistic
it's<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.460> cool<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.199> when<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> go

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it's just so cool to me and when we go

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's just so cool to me and when we go
into<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> well-lit<00:00:56.610> area<00:00:57.090> you'll<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.930> able<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
into a well-lit area you'll be able to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
into a well-lit area you'll be able to
see<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.820> know<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.390> shaders

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
see what you know what these shaders

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.130 
see what you know what these shaders
looks<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.460> daylight<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:03.840> my<00:01:04.019> opinion

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
looks like in daylight and in my opinion

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.820 
looks like in daylight and in my opinion
this<00:01:04.920> shaders<00:01:05.339> looks<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:06.090> amazing

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
this shaders looks really amazing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
this shaders looks really amazing
although<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.040> shadows<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.360> dark<00:01:09.630> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
although these shadows are a bit dark in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590 
although these shadows are a bit dark in
my<00:01:09.960> opinion<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.799> hey<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.670> gives<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
my opinion but hey it gives off that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.050 
my opinion but hey it gives off that
realistic<00:01:13.439> look<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.729> these

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
realistic look and you know these

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
realistic look and you know these
shadows<00:01:15.600> aren't<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.259> blocky<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
shadows aren't very blocky which is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
shadows aren't very blocky which is
really<00:01:17.939> nice<00:01:18.150> although<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:19.110> doesn't<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.799> know

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really nice although it doesn't you know

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
really nice although it doesn't you know
it<00:01:20.130> doesn't<00:01:20.310> fit<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> purpose<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.299> Minecraft

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it doesn't fit the purpose of Minecraft

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.469 
it doesn't fit the purpose of Minecraft
but<00:01:22.439> still<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.400> cool<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> really
