00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
two years ago I think with dom i played

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.479 
two years ago I think with dom i played
a<00:00:34.410> dom<00:00:34.740> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.129> bit<00:00:35.539> and<00:00:36.539> i<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.890> fairly<00:00:38.309> well

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
a dom a little bit and i do fairly well
