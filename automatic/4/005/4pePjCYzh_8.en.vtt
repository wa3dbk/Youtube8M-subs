00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.020
 today I was speaking with an Argentine deputy and 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.029
 begins to tell me how is the subject of 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.429
 the kirchner with the means of 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.920
 communication how deputies buy how 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.230
 they buy power and today I say this and what 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.590
 It is happening in Colombia means 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.619
 of communication filled with advertising 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:27.740
 government then your coverage of everything 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.080
 that I've seen the government notices in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.250
 the news of the same decision to 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.040
 snail and rcn that softens any 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.590
 they are not spending billions of pesos on 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.590
 advertising 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.720
 to buy image the president has 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.510
 the best press I think there has been in 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.630
 history by precisely account of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.090
 that I join the congress of the deputies 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.300
 paid are spending the budget 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.629
 national buying deputies then I 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.170
 had a deputy a few days ago 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.150
 it's not that it's not affect to the government my 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.420
 competition came with 50 billion 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.310
 weights that is around 30 million 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.369
 of dollars the government swims that silver 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.740
 so that he would invest in his region the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.660
 obviously arrived with your contractor and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.540
 I said mayor here I have 20 million 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.340
 of dollars you need us to do this 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.930
 but here is the contractor then 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.240
 there is a there is a withering in the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.580
 freedom of electoral competition and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.729
 policy on account of a pressure 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 brutal journalist who opposes 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.250
 journalist who gets called palace what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.210
 they take out 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.140
 look at a policy was in a meeting 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.260
 our 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.600
 came to work on Monday and they took her out 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.110
 has a contract to make a contract 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 in which they cast it is a matter of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.140
 persecution entrepreneurs 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.469
 they receive calls from the president of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.950
 government being air that support this 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:06.790
 candidacy I will tell you what I 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.570
 I have lived, I went to Colombia 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.690
 what is a country where I have lived and wanted 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.720
 interview the uribe president 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.760
 whom I admire and also the president 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.379
 Juan Manuel Santos 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 and if this hurt and he received me in his 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.709
 estate 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 and when he arrived in BogotÃ¡, he told me not to 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.480
 president saints will not not receive you 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.010
 because although you are with uribe 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.170
 but for the love of god and the president 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.850
 saints elected him president because 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.930
 I was with uribe not 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.200
 then now 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.200
 one says but how can that be possible 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540
 but he does not like the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.840
 live interviews with the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.930
 friends journalists who in press 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 they not only asked the questions for 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.660
 written but they demanded to see the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.270
 Answers already edited before publishing 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.610
 and they had them in the pen for 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.720
 stain to change to me what I 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
 surprising is that the project has not 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.190
 said that he has not said he knows that this 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.620
 interview was made under these conditions 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.690
 it touched us to send us polls so much is for 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.490
 that at least the reader knew that 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.470
 it was not a spontaneous topic that was not a 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.880
 question and answers but it was a 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.550
 subject absolutely prepared the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.500
 President Santos is afraid of this 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.930
 confrontation for that the political debate 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.640
 it's going to be so interesting, I think so 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.520
 we have to go quickly to the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.290
 advertising and we are absolutely 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.970
 excited about their candidacies 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.960
 pacho santos we came back with francisco 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.960
 saints after the break
