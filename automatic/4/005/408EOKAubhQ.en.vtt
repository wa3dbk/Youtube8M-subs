I'm swiping right and so on you you
understand<00:01:06.749> how<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.959> works<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.889> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
understand how this works out it's a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.359 
understand how this works out it's a
it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.179> good<00:01:09.389> control<00:01:09.719> system<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.979> it's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's a good control system and it's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's a good control system and it's
worked<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.759> other<00:01:11.939> Schmucks<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.389> the<00:01:12.450> past

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
worked for other Schmucks in the past

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.120 
worked for other Schmucks in the past
and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.959> certainly<00:01:13.139> works<00:01:13.499> for<00:01:13.709> this<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:13.979> I'm

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and it certainly works for this one I'm

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.129 
and it certainly works for this one I'm
shooting<00:01:14.520> automatically<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.719> is<00:01:15.929> an

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
shooting automatically which is an

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.629 
shooting automatically which is an
absolute<00:01:16.560> godsend<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.009> basically<00:01:17.429> you

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
absolute godsend because basically you

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.730 
absolute godsend because basically you
just<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.969> your<00:01:18.209> shooting<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.689> time<00:01:19.079> so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.169 
just want your shooting all the time so
you<00:01:20.009> certainly<00:01:20.279> don't<00:01:20.549> need<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:20.939> button

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
you certainly don't need a little button

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.690 
you certainly don't need a little button
on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.329> screen<00:01:21.450> telling<00:01:21.899> you<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.109> do<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.700> what

so<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:17.800> craft<00:02:18.100> will<00:02:18.250> also<00:02:18.459> change<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.330> move

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so my craft will also change as I move

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.050 
so my craft will also change as I move

get my splitter shot hit as far as I've

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.720 
get my splitter shot hit as far as I've
seen<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.800> three<00:02:39.040> stages<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.489> presented

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
seen in the three stages that presented

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.180 
seen in the three stages that presented
in<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.510> early<00:02:40.750> demo<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> are

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
in this in this early demo so you are

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.199 
in this in this early demo so you are
doing<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> same<00:02:42.489> thing<00:02:42.760> over<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.000> over<00:02:43.090> again

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
doing the same thing over and over again

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.000 
doing the same thing over and over again
it's<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.570> quite<00:02:43.780> as<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.010> spectacular

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
it's not quite as a spectacular

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.199 
it's not quite as a spectacular
therefore<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:46.530> cave<00:02:47.530> schmap<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.190> riding<00:02:48.520> or

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
therefore as a cave schmap or riding or

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.360 
therefore as a cave schmap or riding or
something<00:02:49.630> along<00:02:49.720> those<00:02:49.959> lines<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.190> core

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
something along those lines but the core

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.490 
something along those lines but the core
gameplay<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:51.850> strong<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.570> that's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
gameplay is really strong and that's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.520 
gameplay is really strong and that's
what<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.980> key<00:02:54.520> here<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.720> game<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.470> is

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
what is key here this is a game that is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.620 
what is key here this is a game that is
harking<00:02:57.100> back<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.310> an<00:02:57.580> earlier<00:02:57.970> form<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.510> know

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
harking back to an earlier form you know

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.580 
harking back to an earlier form you know
the<00:02:58.810> Commodore<00:02:59.260> 64<00:02:59.800> era<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.250> shooter<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.590> its

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the Commodore 64 era of shooter and its

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.250 
the Commodore 64 era of shooter and its
its<00:03:02.950> its<00:03:03.489> remaining<00:03:03.850> true<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.630> that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
its its remaining true to that that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.920 
its its remaining true to that that
style<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.800> plan<00:03:06.010> i<00:03:06.040> think<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.930> that's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
style of plan i think that that's that's

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.410 
style of plan i think that that's that's
certainly<00:03:08.350> an<00:03:08.680> amiable<00:03:09.190> kind<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.610> thing<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.269> do

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
certainly an amiable kind of thing to do

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.229 
certainly an amiable kind of thing to do
so<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:12.040> design<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.400> these<00:03:12.610> ships<00:03:12.940> looks

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
so the design of these ships looks

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.300 
so the design of these ships looks
absolutely<00:03:13.570> fantastic<00:03:13.959> i<00:03:14.500> think<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:14.980> this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
absolutely fantastic i think this this

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.370 
absolutely fantastic i think this this
this<00:03:15.549> art<00:03:16.000> style<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.510> looks<00:03:16.690> really<00:03:16.840> legit

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
this art style just looks really legit

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.229 
this art style just looks really legit
but<00:03:17.739> everything<00:03:18.010> moves<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.459> along<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.850> good

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
but everything moves it along a good

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.280 
but everything moves it along a good
pace<00:03:19.480> smoothly<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.790> backgrounds<00:03:22.390> are

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
pace smoothly and the backgrounds are

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.610 
pace smoothly and the backgrounds are
