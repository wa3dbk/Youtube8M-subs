00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
fluid way of doing it and it's really

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.650 
fluid way of doing it and it's really
easy<00:02:16.400> try<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.460> out<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.850> your<00:02:17.970> receivers<00:02:18.540> it

also gets the ball into it
tuck<00:02:20.190> much<00:02:20.430> quicker<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.510> also<00:02:21.720> allows<00:02:22.350> them<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
tuck much quicker it also allows them to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.160 
tuck much quicker it also allows them to
make<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> transition<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.850> field<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.450> lot<00:02:24.630> faster

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
make a transition a field a lot faster

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.720 
make a transition a field a lot faster
if<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:25.410> need<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> turn<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.040> go<00:02:26.160> up<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.520> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
if they need to turn and go up like this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.910 
if they need to turn and go up like this
again<00:02:26.810> we're<00:02:27.810> moving<00:02:28.050> across<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> field<00:02:28.620> high
