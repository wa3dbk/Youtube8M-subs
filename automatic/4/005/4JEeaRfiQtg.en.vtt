hey guys this is g-man I'm showing you
today<00:00:04.380> my<00:00:04.680> newest<00:00:05.069> cleated<00:00:05.730> GameCube

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
today my newest cleated GameCube

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.600 
today my newest cleated GameCube
portable<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:07.680> made<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.160> Commission

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
portable and I made this on Commission

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.940 
portable and I made this on Commission
so<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.269> already<00:00:09.450> sold<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.679> I'll<00:00:10.800> probably

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
so it's already sold but I'll probably

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.830 
so it's already sold but I'll probably
be<00:00:11.280> making<00:00:11.460> more<00:00:11.849> as<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.120> was<00:00:12.360> pretty<00:00:12.630> easy

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
be making more as this was pretty easy

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.700 
be making more as this was pretty easy
and<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.710> made<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.920> fairly<00:00:14.099> quickly<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:16.440> like

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and I made it fairly quickly so like

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
always I have a 3.5 inch screen an

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.429 
always I have a 3.5 inch screen an
analog<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> c-stick<00:00:21.060> usable<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.020> 3d<00:00:22.350> s

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.040 
analog and the c-stick usable with 3d s
sliders<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.359> take<00:00:24.600> them<00:00:24.810> from

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
sliders and now I do not take them from

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.500 
sliders and now I do not take them from
a<00:00:25.230> 3d<00:00:25.470> s<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.980> bought<00:00:26.519> them<00:00:26.699> separately<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.269> eBay

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
a 3d s I bought them separately on eBay

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.710 
a 3d s I bought them separately on eBay
and<00:00:27.769> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> directional<00:00:29.570> d-pad<00:00:30.570> right

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and this is a directional d-pad right

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
and this is a directional d-pad right
here<00:00:30.890> then<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.040> got<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> start<00:00:32.550> button

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
right here and a B X Y and I never know

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
right here and a B X Y and I never know
if<00:00:35.670> room<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> original<00:00:36.840> GameCube

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.369 
if room to use the original GameCube
ABXY<00:00:38.160> layout<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> had<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> move<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> X<00:00:40.079> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
ABXY layout so I had to move the X but

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.010 
ABXY layout so I had to move the X but
in<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> different<00:00:40.800> spot<00:00:40.980> still<00:00:41.640> works<00:00:41.820> fine<00:00:42.020> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
in a different spot still works fine and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
in a different spot still works fine and
then<00:00:43.290> there's<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.620> speakers<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.160> fun<00:00:44.610> right

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
then there's two speakers have fun right

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.360

using<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> transistor<00:01:05.850> method<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.960> there's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
using the transistor method so there's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
using the transistor method so there's
no<00:01:07.290> long<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.159> short<00:01:08.400> press<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.970> one
