steam is movable and it has four buttons
just<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.330> yeah<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:22.250> there

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

just here I think there yeah right there
each<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> different<00:01:24.570> sound<00:01:25.430> some<00:01:26.430> come

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
each one has a different sound some come

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.040 
each one has a different sound some come
with<00:01:26.610> light<00:01:26.880> version<00:01:27.600> do

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.350 

so<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:37.370> not<00:01:38.370> entirely<00:01:38.730> sure<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so that's that not entirely sure that is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
so that's that not entirely sure that is
so<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.320> anybody<00:01:40.650> knows<00:01:40.890> let<00:01:41.130> me<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.340> because

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.390 
we just have to take the legs off which

i think is really crap yeah yeah yeah
then<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.700> figures<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.299> climb<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.840> well

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
then you figures can climb up there well

then you figures can climb up there well
they<00:02:25.829> could<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.250> forcing<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> figures

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
they could do forcing the figures

they could do forcing the figures

enough<00:03:00.150> space<00:03:00.389> cuz<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.410> blocked<00:03:01.799> by<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
enough space cuz the is blocked by a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580 
enough space cuz the is blocked by a
little<00:03:02.310> piece<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.549> plastic<00:03:02.970> down<00:03:03.090> there<00:03:03.590> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
little piece of plastic down there so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.309 
little piece of plastic down there so
there's<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:06.359> see<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> come<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
there's that and see the come the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.650 
there's that and see the come the
console<00:03:07.799> isn't<00:03:08.099> like<00:03:08.280> greatly<00:03:09.060> detailed<00:03:09.450> but

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
console isn't like greatly detailed but

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.120 
console isn't like greatly detailed but
it<00:03:09.750> isn't<00:03:10.049> too<00:03:10.470> bad<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:13.829> goes<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.130> top

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
it isn't too bad is the that goes on top

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
it seems to be fairly sturdy at the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.010

would collapse that's actually where the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.020 
would collapse that's actually where the
batteries<00:05:37.360> go<00:05:37.390> in<00:05:37.720> there<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:39.400> took<00:05:39.580> me<00:05:39.640> ages<00:05:39.760> to
