I<00:02:05.970> was<00:02:06.970> kind<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.899> skeptical<00:02:08.830> because<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.280> never

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489

the<00:02:38.620> color<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.410> let<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> sit<00:02:41.769> for<00:02:41.799> at<00:02:42.130> least

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
the color and I let it sit for at least

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.720 
the color and I let it sit for at least
an<00:02:42.790> hour<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.680> while<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.040> other<00:02:45.190> so
