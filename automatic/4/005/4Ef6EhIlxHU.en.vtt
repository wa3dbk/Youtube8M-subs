 for now it's still over 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.780
 but I can already do it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.600
 direct my domain to those 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 things but what I mean is to have 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
 an idea and Fabiana also approved that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.719
 will be the following was in this drawing 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.610

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.890

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.250
 in another way also to do 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
 that is a mural of the subscribers only 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.550
 this time with using a little more 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.650
 creativity gives certain 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.140
 the group of residents are already doing 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.230
