00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.490
 hello everyone today I bring a manicure 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.560
 gray with a little detail in this 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.590
 finger 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.830
 well I chose the color gray because 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.500
 we are in winter and it is one more color 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.830
 Dark 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.560
 but you can make the color that 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.130
 prefer 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.260
 to perform I will choose this tone 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.070
 Gray 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.070
 of essence 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 I will need 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.089
 black for the little dots that you the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:54.850
 mercadona I also chose the silver that 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:57.980
 you want too and white 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.960
 that this particular steckler 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.730
 I have chosen these four colors because 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.250
 more or less combine with each other 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.790
 but for example if you want to do it with 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.280
 red can catch or can work the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.520
 same red with a little bit of white 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.970
 and they can take a purple and a beige 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 example or what you want 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.200
 to those who hit them well I just 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.090
 I will need a little bit of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.620
 adhesive tape 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.710
 we paste it on the table 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.450
 and we 'll pour it in this hand 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.360
 to show how the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.970
 how do you do it 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.970
 we put a little bit of each painting 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.560
 we are going to need toothpicks also that 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.570
 You say I forget to pour one 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.170
 little bit of each painting on the ribbon 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.299
 I use feel why not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.620
 I do not have any of those palettes that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.450
 they use 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.450
 some girls online 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.510
 White 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 what 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.390
 and now with patience 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.750
 we will take a toothpick 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.640
 it also serves a pencil 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.670
 that the little tip is a little thicker 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.620
 and we can be more precise 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.620
 and nothing will we continue 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.040
 diagonal points 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.640
 at the beginning the toothpick is too 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.950
 fine and the point is too small 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.990
 but as we are going to use it 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.850
 it goes condenses in the paint on the tip 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.960
 and it's going better 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.700
 after the gray I notice here 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.700
 I have used white 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.650
 change stick so as not to mix 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.650
 colors 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.130
 now use 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.290
 black 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.719
 then the silver color 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.680
 and so on until we finish 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.590
 the nail following the same colors as 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.240
 we have used this is the result a 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.979
 once finished 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.620
 I have to say that we have not left very 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.050
 straight because 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.280
 I was more aware of it being seen 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.100
 all right 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.530
 that it would look good but this one that 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.400
 I took it easy you can appreciate that 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.350
 it is more straight 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.020
 nothing this with a little bit of practice 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.720
 every time it will go better and it seems like a 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.180
 way to decorate the easy nail and that 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.980
 has a touch a different touch because 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.100
 the gray nails are little off 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.320
 and a little boring and if we give this 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.470
 tap that is very easy is very fast 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.360
 and I think it looks very good so 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.400
 I do not expect anything to be practiced and that 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.210
 has been useful until the next 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.210
