00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.069
 battistuzzi so much 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.280
 dear batista70phone readers welcome back 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.509
 in this new video today I wanted 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.160
 show you a cover that comes to us 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.410
 directly from pure produced by guard 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 italia.com that I thank the cover 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.070
 for iphone 5 cli car 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.660
 it is a cover made in 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.520
 transparent plastic on the back and 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.020
 shaped silicone on the edges I would say that 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.329
 these two materials are great for 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
 have a great grip as the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.649
 however, the silicone is rough and plastic 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 allows an even better grip 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.370
 therefore an excellent match since 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.859
 we have a very good grip like the rest 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.149
 previous versions that love so 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.879
 always of the line that ier for others 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.710
 devices for which in this respect 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.690
 I found myself well as you see leave 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.460
 free and flash camera and a wide one 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.230
 space of course all the various 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.120
 doors as revenue lightning cable 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.760
 spi speakers that comes in from the cable 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.340
 3.5mm jack these bulges 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.140
 very soft allowing you to press 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.310
 the volume buttons very well 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.170
 rather than the lock button 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 screen unlock and space 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.430
 dedicated to the switch between normal and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 silent, I told you I did not 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.700
 had no problem the cover is 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.280
 perfectly adherent to the device from 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 a sense of solidity and me 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.930
 as usual I call it a cover 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.650
 simple in the sense that we have one 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 protection 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.140
 we have a very good grip so it's a lot 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 solid in hand and a good cover for 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.560
 who does not want to increase by the fact 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.170
 device size because it is 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.670
 very thin and in my case I like it 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.560
 very white version because it creates 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.180
 this frame around the screen that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 who knows me for a long time knows me 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 like to get away from the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.110
 color of the device for which the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.410
 advice says euro and 99 on the site that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.820
 see in descriptions and inside 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.500
 of the article and in my opinion 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.140
 it's great as you see the yes buttons 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.970
 they press very well and I recommend it because 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 because the iphone 5 sell a back in 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.929
 aluminum is not indestructible so 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 let's say device for more than 700 euros 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.440
 see a scratch would do a lot 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.910
 I would say annoyance for which he said this 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.280
 we fit next video on your from 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 christian for batista70phone bye bye 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.790
 Baptists is a lot 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.880
 in the uncertain sense
