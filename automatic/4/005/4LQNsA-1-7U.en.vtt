00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.410 
Maul is a clone wars character so but
the<00:01:56.770> reason<00:01:56.950> why<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.580> impossible<00:01:58.120> point<00:01:58.300> in

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
the reason why is impossible point in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.300 
the reason why is impossible point in
this<00:01:58.510> play<00:01:58.690> set<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:58.960> because<00:01:59.440> that's<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
this play set is because that's the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.370 
this play set is because that's the
point<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.729> which<00:02:00.910> like<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.270> story<00:02:01.600> becomes

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
point of which like the story becomes

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.980 
point of which like the story becomes
non-canon<00:02:03.070> but<00:02:04.060> what<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.360> does<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.750> means

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
non-canon but what that does is it means

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.150 
non-canon but what that does is it means
you<00:02:05.080> can<00:02:05.229> end<00:02:05.350> up<00:02:05.500> with<00:02:05.620> really<00:02:05.950> great

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
you can end up with really great

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.490 
you can end up with really great
matchups<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:07.240> final<00:02:07.780> boss<00:02:07.930> fight<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.260> dark

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500
