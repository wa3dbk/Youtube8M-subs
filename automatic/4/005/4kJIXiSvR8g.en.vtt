I'm played shooting guard in college now

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm played shooting guard in college now
to<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.290> back<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> being<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> point<00:00:35.100> guard<00:00:35.219> again

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
to go back to being a point guard again

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
to go back to being a point guard again
so<00:00:35.850> relearning<00:00:36.300> everything<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.079> then<00:00:37.170> just

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so relearning everything and then just

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.880 
so relearning everything and then just
learning<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> nuances<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.910> NBA<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
I think I've improved as every week has
come<00:00:44.010> along<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:45.690> goal<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> just

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
be ready to take advantage of that it's
something<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.329> bit<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.260> pace<00:00:55.500> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
something a little bit about the pace of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
something a little bit about the pace of
the<00:00:55.800> game<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.039> always<00:00:56.370> seems<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.850> one

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the game that always seems to be one

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
the game that always seems to be one
area<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> rookies<00:00:58.289> tend<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> talk<00:00:58.920> about

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
area that rookies tend to talk about

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.750 
area that rookies tend to talk about
that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> pace<00:01:00.420> adjustment<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
that was there a pace adjustment for you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
that was there a pace adjustment for you
absolutely<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:02.940> still<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.339> when

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
absolutely there still is you know when

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.429 
absolutely there still is you know when
I<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.119> sometimes<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:06.990> instincts

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
I get out there sometimes my instincts

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.500 
I get out there sometimes my instincts
are<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.330> fast

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
as I can but I'm learning how to change

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
as I can but I'm learning how to change
paces<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.740> speeds<00:01:14.010> at

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
paces to use different speeds at

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
paces to use different speeds at
different<00:01:14.700> times<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
different times just to know when to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.590 
different times just to know when to
attack<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> pull<00:01:17.340> pull<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.270> and

able to hit that consistently and I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.679 
able to hit that consistently and I
think<00:01:55.170> defensively<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.540> right

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
think defensively you know I'm all right

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.450 
think defensively you know I'm all right
I'm<00:01:57.869> where<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> need<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.469> defensively<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
I'm where I need to be defensively but I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.850 
I'm where I need to be defensively but I
think<00:01:59.670> offensively<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.270> just

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
think offensively I just

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.100 
think offensively I just
definitely<00:02:01.190> need<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.370> take<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> few<00:02:01.820> set<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.360> go

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
definitely need to take a few set for go

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.480 
definitely need to take a few set for go
back<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.530> what<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.710> said<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.920> moment<00:02:04.100> ago<00:02:04.280> about

back to what you said a moment ago about
the<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.830> we<00:02:06.980> sometimes<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.580> want<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.790> go<00:02:07.940> go

the that we sometimes you want to go go

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.150 
the that we sometimes you want to go go
go<00:02:08.259> because<00:02:09.259> sometimes<00:02:09.649> I'll<00:02:09.830> watch<00:02:09.979> you

drive and I think all of a sudden you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.550 
drive and I think all of a sudden you
think<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:11.900> way<00:02:11.960> man<00:02:12.140> I've<00:02:12.230> got<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.440> get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
think what way man I've got to get

think what way man I've got to get
somebody<00:02:12.740> else<00:02:12.980> involved<00:02:13.430> here<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
somebody else involved here and then the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.910 
somebody else involved here and then the
chain<00:02:14.540> surf<00:02:14.780> change<00:02:15.050> direction<00:02:15.350> or<00:02:15.590> change

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
chain surf change direction or change

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.130 
chain surf change direction or change
your<00:02:16.010> mind<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.090> sometimes<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.780> better

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
your mind is it sometimes a bit better

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.710 
your mind is it sometimes a bit better
for<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.580> play<00:02:19.790> with<00:02:19.820> maybe<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.240> clear<00:02:20.510> head

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
for you to play with maybe a clear head

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720 
for you to play with maybe a clear head
yes<00:02:21.650> yes<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:24.680> people<00:02:25.040> who<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.460> watched

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
yes yes I think people who have watched

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.180 
yes yes I think people who have watched
me<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.360> times<00:02:26.630> early<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.260> they<00:02:27.770> can<00:02:27.950> tell

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
me it at times early on they can tell

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.520 
me it at times early on they can tell
I'm<00:02:28.459> not<00:02:28.670> fully<00:02:29.030> comfortable<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.930> there<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
I'm not fully comfortable out there and

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.410 
I'm not fully comfortable out there and
think<00:02:30.830> that's<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.700> has<00:02:31.880> hurt<00:02:32.090> me<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.390> most

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
think that's what has hurt me the most

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.640 
think that's what has hurt me the most
in<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.840> very<00:02:33.050> beginning<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.520> to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
in the very beginning is just to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
in the very beginning is just to
overthink<00:02:36.650> sometimes<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.910> that's<00:02:38.660> what

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
overthink sometimes and so that's what

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.510 
overthink sometimes and so that's what
I've<00:02:38.959> been<00:02:39.080> focusing<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.370> bill

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
I've been focusing on now is just a bill

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
I've been focusing on now is just a bill
to<00:02:40.640> play<00:02:40.850> with<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> clear<00:02:41.540> head<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.780> go<00:02:42.110> have<00:02:42.320> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
to play with a clear head and go have to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.440 
to play with a clear head and go have to
go<00:02:42.530> out<00:02:42.680> there<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:43.820> what<00:02:44.060> got<00:02:44.270> me

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
go out there and just do what got me

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.330 
go out there and just do what got me
here<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.870> first<00:02:44.930> place<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.620> noticed<00:02:46.250> when

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
here in the first place I noticed when

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.460 
here in the first place I noticed when
you're<00:02:46.489> sitting<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.000> bench<00:02:47.209> you're<00:02:48.200> right

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
you're sitting on the bench you're right

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.140 
you're sitting on the bench you're right
in<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.620> middle<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> coaching<00:02:49.459> staff<00:02:49.489> is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
in the middle of the coaching staff is

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.670 
in the middle of the coaching staff is
that<00:02:50.420> by<00:02:50.570> choice<00:02:50.600> by<00:02:51.050> design<00:02:51.400> no<00:02:53.650> some<00:02:54.650> people

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that by choice by design no some people

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.110 
that by choice by design no some people
thought<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.280> was<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.459> was<00:02:58.580> just<00:02:58.820> coach

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
thought it was but now it was just coach

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.650 
thought it was but now it was just coach
Calbert<00:02:59.570> Cheaney<00:03:00.700> during<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> preseason<00:03:02.000> he

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
told me to sit in between the coaches so

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.530 
told me to sit in between the coaches so
I<00:03:04.220> could<00:03:04.430> hear<00:03:04.640> what<00:03:04.760> they<00:03:04.880> were<00:03:04.940> saying<00:03:05.060> and
