00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.110
 so now a little tip to 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.820
 Construction of the railway and that what me 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.090
 now noticed these guides 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.900
 who have to go to the elevator here 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.289
 always really here right in 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.480
 direction center go in and also 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.890
 so high that the ball is not 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.320
 can come back 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 that is very important if he does not 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.600
 then if the ball does 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.500
 this is exactly what his son's councils are about 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.060
 right on top then you can wood a 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.820
 back a bit and just do not pick up 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.910
 more pure that makes problems then and 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.309
 then maybe something normal 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.190
 I noticed the train, for example 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.309
 here this bracket every time there 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.680
 a ball rolls over it then moves 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.540
 a bit and through that if you 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.610
 Here, for example, makes a turn 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.590
 to and every time you come one 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.250
 load, the rotation is slowing down 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.990
 Outside 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880
 that is, it goes so outward 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.090
 Eventually the ball will fall here 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 out and it is quite normal there 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.819
 could not be so right now 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.779
 do it because the connections 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:21.609
 are relatively flexible and not themselves 

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.490
 no wire now and it's not like that 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:27.279
 fixed connections the only thing you like 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:33.279
 could do it if you could do such a thing 

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:36.520
 ball track made of wire and here so 

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:38.579
 massive things that uses the ball 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.899
 with its weight no deformation 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.240
 but can bring about in the case 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.859
 as I said there is something relatively easy 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 You suddenly see that easily 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.749
 go crazy then the ball 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.069
 a little too fast, that's why 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:55.439
 can she already jump out at 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:58.569
 Okay next time I hope that has you 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.939
 please and have fun at 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.060
 your own ball track to the next 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.060
 times
