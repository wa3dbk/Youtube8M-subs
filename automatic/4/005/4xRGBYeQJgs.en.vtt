know a lot of guys use rubber bands or
casting<00:00:27.240> has<00:00:27.360> these<00:00:27.540> nice<00:00:27.720> little<00:00:27.990> line<00:00:28.310> clips

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
casting has these nice little line clips

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.010 
casting has these nice little line clips
and<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.610> do<00:00:29.850> work<00:00:30.030> pretty<00:00:30.330> good<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
always having to replace the tape

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.500 
always having to replace the tape
because<00:00:32.429> the<00:00:32.550> tapes<00:00:32.789> not<00:00:32.969> gonna<00:00:33.149> stay<00:00:33.359> on

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
because the tapes not gonna stay on

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
because the tapes not gonna stay on
there<00:00:33.660> forever<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
there forever and this is just kind of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
there forever and this is just kind of
an<00:00:35.370> odd<00:00:35.519> I've<00:00:35.699> learned<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.210> works<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.109> for<00:00:37.140> me

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
an odd I've learned it works well for me

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
an odd I've learned it works well for me
and<00:00:37.769> sometimes<00:00:38.460> you'll<00:00:38.789> open<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and sometimes you'll open up your you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.290 
and sometimes you'll open up your you
know<00:00:39.780> box<00:00:40.109> of<00:00:40.320> lines<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.969> you'll<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.179> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
know box of lines and you'll have you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
know box of lines and you'll have you
know<00:00:42.420> 20<00:00:42.659> feet<00:00:43.079> unravelled<00:00:43.679> off<00:00:43.769> some<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> your

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
know 20 feet unravelled off some of your

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500 
know 20 feet unravelled off some of your
spool<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.909> will<00:00:45.059> keep<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.449> from

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
spool so this will keep that from

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
spool so this will keep that from
happening<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.429> I'll<00:00:47.429> pick<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.609> up<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.940> my

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
happening but I'll pick it up with my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
happening but I'll pick it up with my
left<00:00:48.269> hand<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.339> your<00:00:50.609> line<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> be

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
left hand you want your line to be

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
left hand you want your line to be
coming<00:00:51.329> towards<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> bottom<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
coming towards you from the bottom of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.309 
coming towards you from the bottom of
your<00:00:52.949> spool<00:00:53.479> and<00:00:54.479> then<00:00:54.600> I'll<00:00:54.719> use<00:00:54.749> this<00:00:55.079> finger

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319 
your spool and then I'll use this finger

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:57.799 
your spool and then I'll use this finger
here<00:00:55.499> I'll<00:00:55.829> wrap<00:00:56.069> it<00:00:56.100> around<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:57.269> just<00:00:57.510> making

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
here I'll wrap it around I'm just making

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.879 
here I'll wrap it around I'm just making
a<00:00:57.899> loop<00:00:58.139> up<00:00:58.409> top<00:00:58.850> with<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> finger<00:01:00.739> bring<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:01.889 
a loop up top with that finger bring it

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.670 
a loop up top with that finger bring it
back<00:01:02.039> around<00:01:03.019> now<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.229> you're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> do

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
back around now what you're going to do

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.050 
back around now what you're going to do
is<00:01:04.829> you're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> tag<00:01:05.729> into

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is you're going to take your tag into

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.370 
is you're going to take your tag into
your<00:01:06.180> line<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.719> you're<00:01:06.899> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.079> bring<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
your line and you're going to bring it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.319 
your line and you're going to bring it
through<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.890> loop<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.219> you<00:01:08.340> made<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
through the loop that you made from this

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.690 
through the loop that you made from this
direction<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> top<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.430> you're<00:01:11.579> doing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
direction from the top if you're doing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.249 
direction from the top if you're doing
out<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:14.420> I'll<00:01:15.420> bring<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.659> tag<00:01:16.049> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
out this way so I'll bring that tag in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
out this way so I'll bring that tag in
through<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.039> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:18.240> two

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
through and you can see here I got two

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
through and you can see here I got two
strands<00:01:19.140> aligned<00:01:19.439> basically<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.070> bring

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
strands aligned basically when I bring

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.639 
strands aligned basically when I bring
this<00:01:20.399> stripe<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.000> tag<00:01:21.299> end<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.079> want

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
this stripe this tag end through I want

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.480 
this stripe this tag end through I want
it<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.829> run<00:01:22.979> between<00:01:24.740> those<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:26.009> pieces<00:01:26.219> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it to run between those two pieces of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
it to run between those two pieces of
line<00:01:30.380> hopefully<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.859> that<00:01:32.119> then<00:01:33.119> I'm

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
line hopefully you can see that then I'm

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.709 
line hopefully you can see that then I'm
going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.359> take<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.689> tag<00:01:33.930> end<00:01:34.369> pull<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> now

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
going to take my tag end pull and now

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.830 
going to take my tag end pull and now
you've<00:01:36.899> made<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> second<00:01:37.619> loop<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:39.570> tag

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you've made a second loop here this tag

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
you've made a second loop here this tag
is<00:01:40.109> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.469> come<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is going to come back around and just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
is going to come back around and just
through<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> second<00:01:42.750> loop<00:01:42.929> that<00:01:43.170> you've

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
through that second loop that you've

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.960 
through that second loop that you've
made<00:01:45.679> just<00:01:46.679> like<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440 

then<00:01:52.780> you're<00:01:52.930> gonna<00:01:53.020> pull<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.410> tight<00:01:54.450> what

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
then you're gonna pull it tight what

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.390 
then you're gonna pull it tight what
you'll<00:01:55.570> see<00:01:55.750> here<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.230> little<00:01:56.590> circle

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
you'll see here is that little circle

not for everybody it does take a little
practice<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:48.490> learn<00:02:48.730> at<00:02:49.000> first<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:50.470> I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270
