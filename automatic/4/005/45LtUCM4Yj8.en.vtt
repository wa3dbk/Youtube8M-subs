00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
do like they

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.020 
do like they
they<00:04:24.870> completely<00:04:25.290> honest<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:25.950> we<00:04:26.520> did<00:04:26.760> get<00:04:26.910> to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
they completely honest but we did get to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.150 
they completely honest but we did get to
split<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:27.450> wanted<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.780> we<00:04:28.500> got<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:28.950> game

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
split that we wanted to we got one game

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.640 
split that we wanted to we got one game
in<00:04:29.340> San<00:04:29.670> Antonio<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:30.330> think<00:04:31.230> some<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
in San Antonio I think some of the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.650 
in San Antonio I think some of the
reason<00:04:32.010> that<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.310> got<00:04:32.550> completely<00:04:33.120> destroyed

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
reason that we got completely destroyed

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.430 
reason that we got completely destroyed
is<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.260> think<00:04:34.980> we<00:04:35.190> came<00:04:35.430> out<00:04:35.690> when<00:04:36.690> they<00:04:37.080> wanted

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
is I think we came out when they wanted

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.500 
is I think we came out when they wanted
more<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.770> that's<00:04:37.950> that's<00:04:38.280> obvious<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.180> I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
more we do that's that's obvious and I

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.030 
more we do that's that's obvious and I
think<00:04:39.570> what<00:04:39.900> contributes<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:40.830> a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
think what contributes to that I think a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.950 
think what contributes to that I think a
lot<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.280> serious<00:04:41.520> has<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:42.000> when<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.720> road

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
lot of serious has this when the road

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.100 
lot of serious has this when the road
team<00:04:43.260> takes<00:04:43.680> who<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:44.910> lower<00:04:45.090> seat<00:04:45.420> takes

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
team takes who is it lower seat takes

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.830 
team takes who is it lower seat takes
one<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.560> those<00:04:46.710> road<00:04:46.980> games<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:48.240> next<00:04:48.510> road

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
one of those road games the next road

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.560 
one of those road games the next road
game<00:04:49.170> one<00:04:50.100> it's<00:04:50.280> desperation<00:04:50.970> mode<00:04:51.270> for<00:04:51.480> the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
game one it's desperation mode for the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.690 
game one it's desperation mode for the
other<00:04:51.690> team<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.140> also<00:04:52.320> it's<00:04:53.070> almost<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.490> we

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
other team but also it's almost like we

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.220 
other team but also it's almost like we
mission<00:04:54.180> accomplished<00:04:54.600> we've<00:04:54.750> got<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> game

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
mission accomplished we've got the game

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.020 
mission accomplished we've got the game
we<00:04:55.380> wanted<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:56.130> we'll<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.460> back<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.760> dallas<00:04:57.000> to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
we wanted so we'll go back to dallas to

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.940 
we wanted so we'll go back to dallas to
take<00:04:57.090> care<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.810> that's<00:04:58.440> nothing<00:04:58.920> new
