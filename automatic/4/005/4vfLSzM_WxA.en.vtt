00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hi there this is Ranjit and I have this

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.900 
hi there this is Ranjit and I have this
samsung<00:00:03.270> galaxy<00:00:03.810> note<00:00:04.170> 3<00:00:04.200> neo<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:05.130> me<00:00:05.310> which

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
samsung galaxy note 3 neo with me which

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.960 
samsung galaxy note 3 neo with me which
has<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> peculiar<00:00:06.839> 6<00:00:07.649> core<00:00:07.950> processor<00:00:08.490> that's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
has a peculiar 6 core processor that's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.209 
has a peculiar 6 core processor that's
known<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.929> hexa<00:00:10.500> core<00:00:10.650> processor<00:00:11.099> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
known as the hexa core processor and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.580 
known as the hexa core processor and
let's<00:00:11.820> look<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> benchmarks<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.139> actually

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
let's look at the benchmarks I actually

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.740 
let's look at the benchmarks I actually
do<00:00:13.889> not<00:00:14.009> believe<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> lot<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.580> benchmarks<00:00:15.269> but

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
do not believe a lot in benchmarks but

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.269 
do not believe a lot in benchmarks but
quite<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> few<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.710> asked<00:00:16.980> me<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> do

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
quite a few of you have asked me to do

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.830 
quite a few of you have asked me to do
benchmarking<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:18.720> do

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
benchmarking on this one so we will do

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.870 
benchmarking on this one so we will do
that<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> before<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.800> let<00:00:20.400> me<00:00:20.550> show<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that and before that let me show you the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.060 
that and before that let me show you the
configuration<00:00:21.060> using<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> cpu-z

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
configuration using this cpu-z

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.420 
configuration using this cpu-z
application<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
application now and as you can see the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
application now and as you can see the
CPU<00:00:26.760> said<00:00:27.109> detects<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.560> six<00:00:28.830> course

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
CPU said detects that it has six course

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
CPU said detects that it has six course
and<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.820> saying<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.260> it's<00:00:31.260> based<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.949> arm

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and it's saying that it's based on arm

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
and it's saying that it's based on arm
cortex<00:00:32.579> a15<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> clocked<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.570> 1.3<00:00:34.050> Giga<00:00:34.440> huh

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
cortex a15 and clocked at 1.3 Giga huh

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
cortex a15 and clocked at 1.3 Giga huh
but<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.910> entirely<00:00:36.210> true<00:00:36.390> actually

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
but that's not entirely true actually

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
but that's not entirely true actually
out<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.710> 6<00:00:38.040> course<00:00:38.370> 2<00:00:38.940> codes<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.480> based

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
out of that 6 course 2 codes are based

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440 
out of that 6 course 2 codes are based
on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> arm<00:00:40.110> cortex<00:00:40.670> a15<00:00:41.670> architecture<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
on the arm cortex a15 architecture and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
on the arm cortex a15 architecture and
they<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.690> clocked<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.110> 1.7<00:00:43.950> regards<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.940> box

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
they are clocked at 1.7 regards the box

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
they are clocked at 1.7 regards the box
also<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.250> 4<00:00:47.610> codes

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
also say is that and the other 4 codes

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
also say is that and the other 4 codes
are<00:00:48.239> clocked<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.840> 1.3<00:00:49.379> gigahertz<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
are clocked at 1.3 gigahertz that are

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
are clocked at 1.3 gigahertz that are
based<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> arm<00:00:51.180> cortex<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.780> 7<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
based on the arm cortex is 7 and as you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
based on the arm cortex is 7 and as you
can<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> cores<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.570> working<00:00:55.199> fine

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can see all the cores are working fine

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
can see all the cores are working fine

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
using this device and yes I know it's a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
using this device and yes I know it's a
bit<00:01:23.580> early<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.970> comment<00:01:24.150> upon<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> battery

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
bit early to comment upon the battery

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
bit early to comment upon the battery
but<00:01:25.439> initial<00:01:26.250> impressions<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> battery<00:01:27.090> life

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
but initial impressions the battery life

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.850 
but initial impressions the battery life
on<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.570> device<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.229> good<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.619> for

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
on this device is pretty good and for

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
on this device is pretty good and for
most<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> users<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.180> say<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
most of the users I would say it can

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
most of the users I would say it can
easily<00:01:31.079> last<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.710> full<00:01:31.920> working<00:01:32.250> day<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
easily last one full working day and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.450 
easily last one full working day and
these<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> sensors<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.409> Samsung<00:01:35.100> did<00:01:35.280> not

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
these are the sensors so Samsung did not

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
these are the sensors so Samsung did not
skimp<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> sensors<00:01:37.170> Department<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> can

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
skimp on the sensors Department you can

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
skimp on the sensors Department you can
pause<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> screen<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.930> let's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
pause the screen to look at it so let's

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.730 
pause the screen to look at it so let's
close<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.000> let's<00:01:42.020> exit<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.049> apps<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
close this and let's exit this apps and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
close this and let's exit this apps and
actually<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.729> run<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.780> popular

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
actually I have run a lot of popular

the details you can just pause the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
the details you can just pause the
screen<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.150> look<00:03:28.390> at<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.720> same<00:03:30.180> so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
screen to have a look at the same so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.479 
screen to have a look at the same so
that's<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.019> antutu<00:03:32.709> benchmark<00:03:32.860> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
that's for the antutu benchmark and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.300 
that's for the antutu benchmark and
let's<00:03:34.300> also<00:03:34.720> run<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.140> Lena<00:03:35.470> Mach<00:03:35.709> 2<00:03:35.920> yes<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
let's also run this Lena Mach 2 yes I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.930 
let's also run this Lena Mach 2 yes I
know<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.850> very<00:03:38.070> robust<00:03:39.070> benchmark

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
know it's not a very robust benchmark

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.740 
know it's not a very robust benchmark
it's<00:03:40.090> pretty<00:03:40.360> old

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
it's pretty old

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.630 
it's pretty old
but<00:03:41.140> just<00:03:41.560> for<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.739> heck<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.160> let's<00:03:42.220> rather

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.730 

and<00:03:48.640> again<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.120> maxing<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.810> out<00:03:49.990> at<00:03:50.290> around

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
and again it's maxing it out at around

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.400 
and again it's maxing it out at around
