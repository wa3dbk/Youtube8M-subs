qualifying<00:01:10.250> driver<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:11.720> think<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
qualifying driver and I think to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.350 
qualifying driver and I think to
perfectly<00:01:13.159> honest<00:01:13.460> he<00:01:13.610> was<00:01:13.730> just<00:01:13.909> really

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
perfectly honest he was just really

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.850 
perfectly honest he was just really
unlucky<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.050> be<00:01:15.110> matched<00:01:15.350> up<00:01:15.500> against<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
unlucky to be matched up against the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.830 
unlucky to be matched up against the
best<00:01:16.010> Ian<00:01:16.250> Vettel<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:16.820> know<00:01:16.970> one<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.659> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
best Ian Vettel as we know one of the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.020 
best Ian Vettel as we know one of the
best<00:01:18.080> one<00:01:18.380> lap<00:01:18.560> specialists<00:01:19.190> in<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> world<00:01:19.700> he

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
best one lap specialists in the world he

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.420 
best one lap specialists in the world he
can<00:01:20.210> bring<00:01:20.840> out<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.320> best<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.860> car<00:01:22.070> for<00:01:22.250> one

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
can bring out the best in a car for one

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.760 
can bring out the best in a car for one
lap<00:01:22.810> probably<00:01:23.810> better<00:01:24.020> than<00:01:24.140> anyone<00:01:24.380> else<00:01:24.620> on

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
lap probably better than anyone else on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.950 
lap probably better than anyone else on
the<00:01:24.920> grid<00:01:25.130> maybe<00:01:25.400> except<00:01:26.240> Lewis<00:01:26.450> Hamilton<00:01:26.870> I

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
the grid maybe except Lewis Hamilton I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.990 
the grid maybe except Lewis Hamilton I
think<00:01:27.200> Lewis<00:01:27.710> Hamilton<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.250> Preston<00:01:28.880> vet

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
think Lewis Hamilton and Preston vet

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.190 
think Lewis Hamilton and Preston vet
although<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.600> know<00:01:29.690> if<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:29.960> were<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.080> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
although you know if they were in the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.690 
although you know if they were in the
same<00:01:30.350> car<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:30.620> qualifying<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.610> that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
same car for qualifying I think that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.160 
same car for qualifying I think that
would<00:01:31.790> be<00:01:31.820> extremely<00:01:31.970> fun<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.690> see<00:01:32.930> which<00:01:33.050> one

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
would be extremely fun to see which one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.110 
would be extremely fun to see which one
of<00:01:33.229> those<00:01:33.320> was<00:01:33.560> fastest<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:34.729> yeah<00:01:34.850> Mark

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
of those was fastest but yeah Mark

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.910 
of those was fastest but yeah Mark
Webber<00:01:35.330> he<00:01:35.840> was<00:01:35.960> always<00:01:36.290> up<00:01:36.530> against<00:01:36.770> some

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
Webber he was always up against some

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.450 
Webber he was always up against some
really<00:01:37.159> tough<00:01:37.340> teammate<00:01:38.770> Red<00:01:39.770> Bull<00:01:39.979> he<00:01:40.190> was<00:01:40.340> up

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
really tough teammate Red Bull he was up

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.140 
really tough teammate Red Bull he was up
against<00:01:40.790> Coulthard<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.830> also<00:01:43.150> bettered

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
against Coulthard and also bettered

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.330 
against Coulthard and also bettered
obviously<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.840> then<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.530> know<00:01:45.650> Minardi<00:01:46.130> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
obviously and then you know Minardi and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.359 
obviously and then you know Minardi and
I<00:01:46.400> think<00:01:46.640> he<00:01:46.700> was<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:46.909> against<00:01:48.070> Minardi<00:01:49.070> Jackie

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
I think he was up against Minardi Jackie

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.010 
I think he was up against Minardi Jackie
I<00:01:49.490> should<00:01:49.760> say<00:01:49.940> he<00:01:50.390> wasn't<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:50.659> against<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I should say he wasn't up against the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.510 
I should say he wasn't up against the
toughest<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.470> competition<00:01:51.950> but<00:01:52.100> once<00:01:52.280> he<00:01:52.430> got

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
toughest of competition but once he got

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.280 
toughest of competition but once he got
the<00:01:52.670> redbull<00:01:53.000> seat<00:01:53.240> he<00:01:53.869> was<00:01:53.990> always<00:01:54.110> up

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
the redbull seat he was always up

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.690 
the redbull seat he was always up
against<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.710> really<00:01:54.950> fast<00:01:55.159> driver<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.640> know

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
against the really fast driver we know

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.280 
against the really fast driver we know
we<00:01:56.060> know<00:01:56.180> Coulthard<00:01:56.690> when<00:01:56.840> he<00:01:56.930> went<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.140> Red

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
we know Coulthard when he went to Red

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.450 
we know Coulthard when he went to Red
Bull<00:01:57.440> he<00:01:57.650> was<00:01:57.770> towards<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> end<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.340> his

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
Bull he was towards the end of his

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580 
Bull he was towards the end of his
career<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:58.909> he<00:01:58.940> was<00:01:59.119> still<00:01:59.270> fast<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.840> you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
career but he was still fast and you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
career but he was still fast and you
know<00:02:00.710> Coulthard<00:02:01.130> versus<00:02:01.460> whoever<00:02:01.700> was<00:02:01.850> always

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
know Coulthard versus whoever was always

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.840 
know Coulthard versus whoever was always
quite<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> good<00:02:02.450> battle<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:03.619> Webber

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
quite a good battle I think Webber

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.160 
quite a good battle I think Webber
generally<00:02:04.850> got<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.119> better<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.420> Coulthard<00:02:05.960> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
generally got the better of Coulthard so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.719 
generally got the better of Coulthard so
that's<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.530> know<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> pretty<00:02:06.830> good<00:02:07.070> thing<00:02:07.250> cool

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that's you know a pretty good thing cool

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.249 
that's you know a pretty good thing cool
thought<00:02:07.909> obviously<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.420> fought<00:02:09.019> for<00:02:09.049> a

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
thought obviously and fought for a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.960 
thought obviously and fought for a
couple<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.769> Championships<00:02:10.250> himself<00:02:10.640> against

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
couple of Championships himself against

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.910 
couple of Championships himself against
Schumacher<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.689> we<00:02:12.110> all<00:02:12.200> knew<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> Coulthard

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
Schumacher so we all knew that Coulthard

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.220 
Schumacher so we all knew that Coulthard
was<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.280> very<00:02:13.430> good<00:02:13.610> driver

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
was a very good driver

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.619 
was a very good driver
you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.819> still<00:02:17.819> think<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.239> more<00:02:18.390> Weber

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
you know I still think the more Weber

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.330 
you know I still think the more Weber
probably<00:02:19.349> should<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.560> won<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.890> 2010

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
probably should have won the 2010

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.940 
probably should have won the 2010
championship<00:02:20.909> he<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.359> have<00:02:21.480> made<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.950> one

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
championship he just have made that one

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.399 
championship he just have made that one
mistake<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.060> Korea<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:25.049> really

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
mistake I think in Korea that really

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.740 
mistake I think in Korea that really
cost<00:02:25.620> him<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.950> championship<00:02:26.329> my<00:02:27.329> opinion

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
cost him the championship my opinion

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.580 
cost him the championship my opinion
that's<00:02:27.900> where<00:02:28.079> he<00:02:28.140> lost<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.379> championship

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that's where he lost the championship

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
that's where he lost the championship
might<00:02:28.950> Weber<00:02:29.159> was<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
might Weber was that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.599 
might Weber was that
crashing<00:02:31.230> career<00:02:31.560> where<00:02:31.799> he<00:02:31.890> slid<00:02:32.159> onto<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
crashing career where he slid onto the

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.259 
crashing career where he slid onto the
curb<00:02:32.790> spun<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.629> around<00:02:33.689> took<00:02:34.109> out<00:02:34.290> Rosberg

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
curb spun it around took out Rosberg

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.789 
curb spun it around took out Rosberg
that<00:02:36.269> was<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.659> my<00:02:36.689> opinion<00:02:37.019> for<00:02:37.349> my<00:02:37.500> Weber's

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
that was it in my opinion for my Weber's

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.410 
that was it in my opinion for my Weber's
2010<00:02:38.220> season<00:02:38.640> he<00:02:38.849> obviously<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.209> was

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
2010 season he obviously I think was

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
2010 season he obviously I think was
still<00:02:39.569> leading<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> championship<00:02:40.049> Orleans<00:02:40.829> I

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
still leading the championship Orleans I

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.920 
still leading the championship Orleans I
was<00:02:41.099> after<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.549> race<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.239> still<00:02:42.689> think

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
was after that race but I still think

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.259 
was after that race but I still think
that<00:02:42.989> was<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.829> place<00:02:44.069> where<00:02:44.670> Weber<00:02:45.060> lost

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
that was the the place where Weber lost

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.929 
that was the the place where Weber lost
at<00:02:45.450> 2010<00:02:46.019> season<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.680> ever<00:02:47.430> since<00:02:47.639> they<00:02:47.819> went

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
at 2010 season and ever since they went

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.460 
at 2010 season and ever since they went
to<00:02:48.060> prayer<00:02:48.329> Lee<00:02:48.480> might<00:02:48.930> weather<00:02:49.109> just<00:02:49.349> hasn't

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
to prayer Lee might weather just hasn't

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.899 
to prayer Lee might weather just hasn't
been<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:49.769> good<00:02:49.889> he's<00:02:50.099> really<00:02:50.310> aggressive<00:02:50.819> on

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
been as good he's really aggressive on

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.119 
been as good he's really aggressive on
his<00:02:51.090> tires<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:52.230> he<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.889> know<00:02:52.919> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
his tires so he just you know the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.039 
his tires so he just you know the
Pirellis<00:02:53.489> obviously<00:02:53.909> degrade<00:02:54.239> very<00:02:54.269> fast<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
Pirellis obviously degrade very fast and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.259 
Pirellis obviously degrade very fast and
he<00:02:55.139> just<00:02:55.319> eat<00:02:55.530> he<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.220> couldn't<00:02:56.790> adapt<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
he just eat he just couldn't adapt to

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.089 
he just eat he just couldn't adapt to
that<00:02:57.359> with<00:02:57.540> his<00:02:57.629> driving<00:02:57.900> style<00:02:58.109> so<00:02:58.439> in<00:02:58.799> my

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
that with his driving style so in my

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.860 
that with his driving style so in my
opinion<00:02:59.189> Mark<00:03:00.120> Weber<00:03:00.299> should<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.659> world

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
opinion Mark Weber should be a world

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.550 
opinion Mark Weber should be a world
champion

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
champion

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.679 
champion
he<00:03:01.799> isn't<00:03:02.180> probably<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.450> he's<00:03:03.569> up

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
he isn't probably because he's up

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.819 
he isn't probably because he's up
against<00:03:03.930> some<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.169> greatest<00:03:04.200> drivers<00:03:04.739> of

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
against some of the greatest drivers of

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.860 
against some of the greatest drivers of
all<00:03:04.859> time<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:06.030> know<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.359> like<00:03:06.450> Vettel

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
all time and you know in like Vettel

Fisichella<00:03:23.090> he<00:03:24.090> won<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.299> race<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.690> Jordan

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
Fisichella he won a race for Jordan

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.729 
Fisichella he won a race for Jordan
I<00:03:25.409> think<00:03:26.629> 2003<00:03:27.629> I'm<00:03:28.049> probably<00:03:28.319> wrong<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.709> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
I think 2003 I'm probably wrong on that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.719 
I think 2003 I'm probably wrong on that
but<00:03:29.280> he<00:03:29.340> won<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> race<00:03:29.579> for<00:03:29.819> Jordan<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.449> Brazil

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
but he won a race for Jordan in Brazil

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.680 
but he won a race for Jordan in Brazil
obviously<00:03:32.729> showing<00:03:32.940> his<00:03:33.120> class<00:03:33.329> because<00:03:33.659> that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
obviously showing his class because that

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.119 
obviously showing his class because that
year<00:03:33.989> Jordan<00:03:34.409> were<00:03:34.500> definitely<00:03:34.829> not<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
year Jordan were definitely not the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.860 
year Jordan were definitely not the
fastest<00:03:35.519> car<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.879> grid<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.389> think<00:03:36.780> actually

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
fastest car on the grid I think actually

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.479 
fastest car on the grid I think actually
they're<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.440> slowest<00:03:37.799> cars<00:03:37.979> on<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.190> grid<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
they're the slowest cars on the grid so

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.300 
they're the slowest cars on the grid so
somehow<00:03:38.909> he<00:03:38.970> pulled<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.540> win<00:03:39.659> out<00:03:39.690> there<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.310> he

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
somehow he pulled a win out there and he

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.059 
somehow he pulled a win out there and he
he<00:03:41.699> also<00:03:41.819> beat<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.870> know<00:03:42.959> Fernando<00:03:43.349> Alonso<00:03:43.769> in

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
he also beat you know Fernando Alonso in

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.979 
he also beat you know Fernando Alonso in
the<00:03:44.190> same<00:03:44.400> car<00:03:44.669> in<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:45.000> couple<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.329> races<00:03:45.510> but

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the same car in a couple of races but

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.899 
the same car in a couple of races but
over<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.829> whole<00:03:46.979> season<00:03:47.400> he<00:03:47.549> just<00:03:47.729> he

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
over the whole season he just he

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.640 
over the whole season he just he
couldn't<00:03:48.180> keep<00:03:48.299> up<00:03:48.449> with<00:03:48.510> Alonso<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.470> think

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
couldn't keep up with Alonso and I think

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860 
couldn't keep up with Alonso and I think
it's<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.829> same<00:03:50.010> case<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:50.310> Webber<00:03:50.870> physical

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
it's the same case with Webber physical

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.390 
it's the same case with Webber physical
I<00:03:51.989> was<00:03:52.079> always<00:03:52.229> matched<00:03:52.919> up<00:03:53.129> against<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
I was always matched up against the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.939 
I was always matched up against the
really<00:03:53.579> good<00:03:53.819> driver<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.449> I<00:03:55.319> think<00:03:55.799> one<00:03:55.919> of

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
really good driver and I think one of

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.170 
really good driver and I think one of
the<00:03:56.040> most<00:03:56.129> notable<00:03:56.549> things<00:03:56.849> for<00:03:57.030> me<00:03:57.150> about

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the most notable things for me about

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.399 
the most notable things for me about
physically<00:03:57.949> was<00:03:58.949> 2009<00:03:59.609> Spa<00:04:00.199> got<00:04:01.199> pole

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
physically was 2009 Spa got pole

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.869 
physically was 2009 Spa got pole
position<00:04:01.889> went<00:04:02.099> on<00:04:02.189> to<00:04:02.310> finish<00:04:02.519> second<00:04:02.849> place

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
position went on to finish second place

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.929 
position went on to finish second place
on<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.239> grid<00:04:03.540> 14<00:04:04.049> years<00:04:04.290> only<00:04:04.439> podium<00:04:05.159> as<00:04:05.400> of

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
on the grid 14 years only podium as of

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.379 
on the grid 14 years only podium as of
yet<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.540> also<00:04:06.810> their<00:04:06.989> only<00:04:07.879> win<00:04:08.879> and<00:04:09.150> win

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
yet and also their only win and win

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.770 
yet and also their only win and win
their<00:04:10.019> only<00:04:10.169> pole<00:04:10.349> position<00:04:10.739> as<00:04:10.979> of<00:04:11.129> yet<00:04:11.340> and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
their only pole position as of yet and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.199 
their only pole position as of yet and
to<00:04:12.780> be<00:04:12.870> honest<00:04:13.139> I<00:04:13.349> think<00:04:14.129> that<00:04:14.370> physically

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
to be honest I think that physically

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.789 
to be honest I think that physically
probably<00:04:15.629> should<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.840> won<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.229> race<00:04:16.289> but

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
probably should have won that race but

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.819 
probably should have won that race but
the<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.880> Ferrari<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.570> räikkönen<00:04:19.349> had<00:04:19.560> curse

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
the the Ferrari of räikkönen had curse

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.319 
the the Ferrari of räikkönen had curse
throughout<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.310> whole<00:04:20.370> race<00:04:20.639> which<00:04:20.820> was<00:04:20.970> you

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
throughout that whole race which was you

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.760 
throughout that whole race which was you
know<00:04:21.359> meant<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.900> he<00:04:21.959> could<00:04:22.109> defend<00:04:22.349> for<00:04:22.650> him

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
know meant that he could defend for him

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.029 
know meant that he could defend for him
so<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.729> my<00:04:23.909> opinion<00:04:24.000> physically<00:04:25.039> I'm

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
so that's just my opinion physically I'm

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.110 
so that's just my opinion physically I'm
not<00:04:26.099> sure<00:04:26.430> whether<00:04:26.550> he<00:04:26.639> would<00:04:26.849> have<00:04:26.969> been<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
not sure whether he would have been a

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.050 
not sure whether he would have been a
world<00:04:27.360> champion<00:04:27.900> on

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
world champion on

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.930 
world champion on
true<00:04:28.300> whether<00:04:28.450> he's<00:04:28.720> ever<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.139> car<00:04:29.350> to

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
true whether he's ever in the car to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.040 
true whether he's ever in the car to
really<00:04:30.940> go<00:04:31.120> for<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.389> championship<00:04:31.840> in

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
really go for the championship in

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.020 
really go for the championship in
obviously<00:04:32.350> Oh<00:04:32.380> five<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.250> was<00:04:33.430> six<00:04:33.790> he<00:04:33.910> was

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
obviously Oh five and I was six he was

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.820 
obviously Oh five and I was six he was
teammates<00:04:34.510> with<00:04:34.630> Alonso<00:04:35.080> but<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.290> think<00:04:35.470> Alonso

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
teammates with Alonso but I think Alonso

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.710 
teammates with Alonso but I think Alonso
just<00:04:36.010> had<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> little<00:04:36.970> bit<00:04:37.150> more<00:04:37.330> than<00:04:37.510> Vista

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
just had a little bit more than Vista

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.510 
just had a little bit more than Vista
color<00:04:37.900> if<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.080> know<00:04:38.169> what<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.350> mean<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.680> outrace

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
color if you know what I mean to outrace

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.370 
color if you know what I mean to outrace
him<00:04:39.730> every<00:04:39.940> time<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.360> physic<00:04:40.720> Ella<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.080> very

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
him every time but physic Ella is a very

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.440 
him every time but physic Ella is a very
great<00:04:42.160> driver<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.639> think<00:04:42.820> we<00:04:42.970> sort<00:04:43.120> forget

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
great driver and I think we sort forget

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.240 
great driver and I think we sort forget
him<00:04:43.600> about<00:04:44.020> what<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.290> great<00:04:44.560> driver<00:04:44.860> he<00:04:45.070> really

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
him about what a great driver he really

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.680 
him about what a great driver he really
was<00:04:45.370> but<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.850> know<00:04:46.240> there<00:04:46.389> are<00:04:46.450> lots<00:04:46.600> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
was but I know there are lots of

scariest<00:05:13.240> accidents<00:05:13.750> we've<00:05:13.870> had<00:05:14.050> in<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.229> last

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
scariest accidents we've had in the last

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.920 
scariest accidents we've had in the last
I<00:05:15.280> can't<00:05:15.610> exactly<00:05:16.060> remember<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.570> year<00:05:16.720> but

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
I can't exactly remember the year but

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.770 
I can't exactly remember the year but
you<00:05:17.050> know<00:05:17.169> it<00:05:17.590> wasn't<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:18.700> know<00:05:18.729> like<00:05:18.850> 50

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
you know it wasn't you know like 50

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.020 
you know it wasn't you know like 50
years<00:05:19.930> ago<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.260> was<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.620> think<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.889> last<00:05:21.280> 25

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
years ago it was I think the last 25

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.300 
years ago it was I think the last 25
years<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:23.139> was<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.260> scary<00:05:23.590> accident<00:05:24.130> and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
years and it was a scary accident and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.010 
years and it was a scary accident and
after<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:25.150> he<00:05:25.300> went<00:05:25.419> on<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.660> win<00:05:25.780> World

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
after that he went on to win World

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.590 
after that he went on to win World
Touring<00:05:26.320> Car<00:05:26.350> races<00:05:26.979> and<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.970> think<00:05:28.389> without

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
Touring Car races and I think without

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.260 
Touring Car races and I think without
his<00:05:28.930> legs<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:30.040> can't<00:05:30.400> remember<00:05:30.580> I'm<00:05:30.820> so<00:05:31.000> bad<00:05:31.240> at

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
his legs I can't remember I'm so bad at

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.840 
his legs I can't remember I'm so bad at
I'm<00:05:31.660> sorry<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.950> remember<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.610> but<00:05:33.789> I

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
I'm sorry and I remember that but I

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.640 
I'm sorry and I remember that but I
think<00:05:34.060> he<00:05:34.180> lost<00:05:34.300> both<00:05:34.539> his<00:05:34.720> late<00:05:34.930> legs<00:05:35.289> next

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
think he lost both his late legs next

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.490 
think he lost both his late legs next
and<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.190> he<00:05:36.669> went<00:05:36.850> on<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.090> win<00:05:37.240> World<00:05:37.840> Touring

and and he went on to win World Touring

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.320 
and and he went on to win World Touring
Car<00:05:38.530> races<00:05:39.190> against<00:05:39.970> some<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.240> best

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
Car races against some of the best

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.940 
Car races against some of the best
drivers<00:05:40.690> in<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.840> world<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.260> category<00:05:41.620> so

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
drivers in the world in that category so

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.219 
drivers in the world in that category so
he<00:05:42.220> was<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.370> class<00:05:42.610> class<00:05:42.970> driver<00:05:43.300> definitely

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
he was a class class driver definitely

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.450 
he was a class class driver definitely
one<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.440> most<00:05:44.500> underrated<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:45.190> all<00:05:45.280> time

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
one of the most underrated of all time

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.400 
one of the most underrated of all time
if<00:05:46.000> he<00:05:46.240> was<00:05:46.390> in<00:05:46.479> a<00:05:46.570> competitive<00:05:46.870> seat<00:05:47.289> in

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
if he was in a competitive seat in

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.040 
if he was in a competitive seat in
Formula<00:05:47.800> One<00:05:47.979> I<00:05:48.300> reckon<00:05:49.300> he<00:05:49.450> probably<00:05:49.780> could

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
Formula One I reckon he probably could

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.930 
Formula One I reckon he probably could
have<00:05:50.140> gone<00:05:50.289> for<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.530> couple<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.860> wins<00:05:51.070> there<00:05:51.370> but

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
have gone for a couple of wins there but

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.029 
have gone for a couple of wins there but
obviously<00:05:52.090> some<00:05:53.050> people<00:05:53.410> they<00:05:53.680> just<00:05:53.860> don't

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
obviously some people they just don't

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.590 
obviously some people they just don't
get<00:05:54.160> given<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.490> opportunities<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.210> they

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
get given the opportunities that they

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.300 
get given the opportunities that they
deserve<00:05:55.630> other<00:05:56.590> people<00:05:56.950> with<00:05:57.100> more<00:05:57.280> money

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
deserve other people with more money

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.370 
deserve other people with more money
just<00:05:58.060> buy<00:05:58.180> their<00:05:58.510> way<00:05:58.539> into<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:59.020> seat<00:05:59.260> and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
just buy their way into the seat and

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.830 
just buy their way into the seat and
that's<00:06:00.340> just<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.700> sad<00:06:00.910> fact<00:06:01.180> about<00:06:01.389> Formula

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
that's just the sad fact about Formula

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.140 
that's just the sad fact about Formula

in the world when he was at Ferrari he
was<00:06:27.700> matched<00:06:28.090> up<00:06:28.270> against<00:06:28.450> Schumacher<00:06:28.900> he

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.300 
nearly won a championship and but he I
don't<00:06:32.320> think<00:06:32.470> he<00:06:32.560> didn't<00:06:32.979> in<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.130> end<00:06:33.160> he<00:06:33.280> lost

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
don't think he didn't in the end he lost

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.839 
don't think he didn't in the end he lost
it<00:06:33.580> by<00:06:33.669> one<00:06:33.970> or<00:06:34.090> two<00:06:34.210> points<00:06:34.450> and

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
it by one or two points and

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.869 
it by one or two points and
you<00:06:35.939> Haakon<00:06:36.659> in<00:06:36.749> that<00:06:36.899> year<00:06:37.169> I<00:06:37.379> think<00:06:37.770> 99<00:06:38.639> I

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
you Haakon in that year I think 99 I

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.549 
you Haakon in that year I think 99 I
think<00:06:39.270> I<00:06:39.569> remember<00:06:39.839> when<00:06:39.990> she<00:06:40.020> mark<00:06:40.379> a<00:06:40.439> lot

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559 
think I remember when she mark a lot

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.999 
think I remember when she mark a lot
broke<00:06:41.279> both<00:06:41.490> his<00:06:41.610> legs<00:06:41.669> in<00:06:42.419> Silverstone<00:06:43.259> crash

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
broke both his legs in Silverstone crash

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.909 
broke both his legs in Silverstone crash
so<00:06:44.749> yeah<00:06:45.749> this<00:06:45.869> is<00:06:45.929> the<00:06:46.229> only<00:06:46.379> pit<00:06:46.709> the

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
so yeah this is the only pit the

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.439 
so yeah this is the only pit the
gameplay<00:06:47.339> of<00:06:47.369> this<00:06:47.580> and<00:06:47.849> the<00:06:47.909> background<00:06:48.270> I

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
gameplay of this and the background I

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.419 
gameplay of this and the background I
did<00:06:48.509> something<00:06:49.020> really<00:06:49.169> stupid<00:06:49.259> it<00:06:50.129> was<00:06:50.309> I

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:50.429 
did something really stupid it was I

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:52.309 
did something really stupid it was I
nearly<00:06:50.969> spun<00:06:51.330> it<00:06:51.449> but<00:06:51.569> I<00:06:51.599> somehow<00:06:51.869> I<00:06:52.020> kept

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
nearly spun it but I somehow I kept

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.369 
nearly spun it but I somehow I kept
under<00:06:52.559> control<00:06:52.649> but<00:06:53.249> yeah<00:06:54.240> I<00:06:54.599> don't<00:06:54.779> why<00:06:55.229> in

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
under control but yeah I don't why in

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.320 
under control but yeah I don't why in
the<00:06:55.469> last<00:06:55.649> lap<00:06:55.919> I<00:06:56.099> managed<00:06:56.399> to<00:06:56.459> just<00:06:56.669> fail<00:06:57.059> big

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
the last lap I managed to just fail big

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.869 
the last lap I managed to just fail big
time<00:06:57.569> but<00:06:57.949> yeah<00:06:58.949> Eddie<00:06:59.129> Irvine<00:06:59.309> is<00:06:59.610> the<00:06:59.699> last

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 
time but yeah Eddie Irvine is the last

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.239 
time but yeah Eddie Irvine is the last
person<00:07:00.240> on<00:07:00.270> my<00:07:00.389> list<00:07:00.889> honestly<00:07:01.889> I<00:07:01.919> think<00:07:02.039> he

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
person on my list honestly I think he

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.549 
person on my list honestly I think he
should<00:07:02.399> have<00:07:02.490> won<00:07:02.669> the<00:07:02.879> the<00:07:03.569> 99<00:07:04.020> championship

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:04.559 
should have won the the 99 championship

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.529 
should have won the the 99 championship
I<00:07:04.619> think<00:07:04.830> it's<00:07:04.949> 99<00:07:05.309> it's<00:07:05.699> probably<00:07:05.999> 98

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
I think it's 99 it's probably 98

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:07.669 
I think it's 99 it's probably 98
I'm<00:07:06.749> always<00:07:06.899> so<00:07:07.110> bad<00:07:07.229> with<00:07:07.439> these<00:07:07.529> things

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:07.679 
I'm always so bad with these things

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:09.139 
I'm always so bad with these things

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:09.149 
about remembering off the top of my head

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.409 
about remembering off the top of my head

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419
