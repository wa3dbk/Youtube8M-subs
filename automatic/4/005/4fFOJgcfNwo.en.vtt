GP<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.880> year<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.150> seem<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.420> be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
GP but this year you seem to be

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.080 
GP but this year you seem to be
struggling<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:29.020> get<00:02:29.170> into<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.620> top<00:02:29.860> 10<00:02:30.160> what

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
struggling to get into the top 10 what

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.880 
struggling to get into the top 10 what
is<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.960> do<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.230> feel<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.650> maybe

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
is that like and do you feel like maybe

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
is that like and do you feel like maybe
because<00:02:33.640> you're<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> rookie<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.450> perhaps

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
because you're a rookie that's perhaps

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.140 
because you're a rookie that's perhaps
more<00:02:35.560> acceptable<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.820> had<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.000> rough

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
more acceptable I think I had a rough

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.360 
more acceptable I think I had a rough
start<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> season<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.080> know<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.710> started

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
start of the season you know I started

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.520 
start of the season you know I started
off<00:02:39.490> with<00:02:39.700> broken<00:02:40.120> tools<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.660> later<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
off with broken tools and later in the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.980 
off with broken tools and later in the
season<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.950> had<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.670> painful<00:02:43.360> wrist<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.840> you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990
