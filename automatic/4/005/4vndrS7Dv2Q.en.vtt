the year well I think it is you know
from<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.310> standpoint<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.120> we<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.570> trying

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
from that standpoint but we just trying

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.290 
from that standpoint but we just trying
to<00:02:44.870> move<00:02:45.050> forward<00:02:45.080> as<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.530> can<00:02:45.740> tell<00:02:45.920> by<00:02:46.160> not

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
to move forward as you can tell by not

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630 
to move forward as you can tell by not
so<00:02:49.300> from<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:49.990> point<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.470> worked<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:51.430> didn't

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
not do this special teams as well as he

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.280 
not do this special teams as well as he
does<00:05:35.040> now<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.540> miss<00:05:36.540> as<00:05:36.690> much<00:05:36.840> as<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.170> know

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
does now I miss as much as you know

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:46.780 
does now I miss as much as you know
about<00:05:37.500> how<00:05:38.250> much<00:05:38.400> guesswork<00:05:39.030> is<00:05:39.330> going<00:05:39.600> into

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.890 

well<00:05:47.790> I<00:05:47.820> think<00:05:47.910> what<00:05:48.150> we've<00:05:48.270> tried<00:05:48.480> to<00:05:48.630> really

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
well I think what we've tried to really

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.630 
well I think what we've tried to really
do<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.260> focus<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:49.800> ourselves<00:05:49.950> and<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.610> think

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
do is focus on ourselves and I think

00:05:50.640 --> 00:06:02.570 
do is focus on ourselves and I think
sometimes<00:06:00.590> just<00:06:01.590> make<00:06:01.980> sure<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.250> won't<00:06:02.430> it

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
sometimes just make sure that won't it

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.660 
sometimes just make sure that won't it
really

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
really

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.250
