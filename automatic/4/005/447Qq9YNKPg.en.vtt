00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the first a hundred first hundred hours

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.729

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
about it like who knows how long a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
about it like who knows how long a
hundred<00:00:52.140> hours<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> seems<00:00:53.370> like

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
hundred hours really is so it seems like

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
hundred hours really is so it seems like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
manual transmission you never know when

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.450 
manual transmission you never know when
you're<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.159> actually

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you're going to use it and it's actually

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
you're going to use it and it's actually
kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> fun<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.420> saves<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.780> gas<00:01:39.890> he<00:01:40.890> had

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
kind of fun and it saves on gas he had

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.730 
kind of fun and it saves on gas he had
me<00:01:41.369> put<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.570> crack<00:01:42.930> between<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.470> tires

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
me put like this crack between the tires

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.840 
me put like this crack between the tires
and<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.200> 300<00:01:46.200> feet<00:01:46.530> backwards<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.579> keep

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
and go like 300 feet backwards and keep

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240 
and go like 300 feet backwards and keep
the<00:01:48.060> line<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.509> between<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.960> tires<00:01:49.229> he<00:01:49.860> had<00:01:50.070> me

the line in between the tires he had me
do<00:01:50.869> backwards<00:01:51.869> figure<00:01:52.619> eight<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.220> hitting<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
do backwards figure eight like hitting a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
do backwards figure eight like hitting a
corner<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.680> concrete

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
corner of like this little concrete

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
corner of like this little concrete
people<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.509> sure<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> tires

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
people like make sure you get the tires

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
people like make sure you get the tires
over<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.649> corner<00:01:58.920> backwards<00:01:59.549> figure<00:02:00.420> eights

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
over that corner backwards figure eights

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
over that corner backwards figure eights
when<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.530> ever<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.340> backwards

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
when I will ever need to use a backwards

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.139 
when I will ever need to use a backwards
figure<00:02:03.180> eight<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.979> still<00:02:04.979> haven't<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.670> if

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
figure eight I still haven't but if
