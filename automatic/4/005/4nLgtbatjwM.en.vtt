00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.870
 hello I'm married to the blog a movie 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.020
 on the web I will explain 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.209
 how to sew the elastic that will allow 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.619
 to maintain the colored pencils 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.619
 in the school kit 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.949
 to start I need a canvas 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.349
 coated carole theme schoolchildren on this 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:30.159
 canvas game I'm laying a strip of 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:34.719
 tracing paper I draw a line on the 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:37.210
 median and then I'll trace some 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.430
 perpendicular features that go 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.789
 match where I'm going 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.320
 sew the elastics 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:49.149
 here I make a first loan that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 corresponds the interval of 4 tiles and 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.780
 I draw a blank line to a second line 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.750
 4 and a half and I continue 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.809
 so I will trace 12-13 successive 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.230
 each and in space is precisely 4 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.320
 spaced and a half this space corresponds 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.650
 to the width of a pencil when I go 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.840
 put it on the canvas now on 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.020
 the elastic I'm going to draw and the features 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.540
 which correspond to the locations of 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 colored pencils and more precisely 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.620
 the height of the colored pencils I 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.110
 will do a very first here at 4 cm this 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.920
 which corresponds to the cost of the canvas and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.360
 back to bottom I will trace 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.480
 successively 12 closely spaced 1.4 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.040
 cm from each other 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.500
 i am now going elbow reborn the a6 on 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.050
 the canvas for that I'm going to position 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.970
 the first feature of the elastic on the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.510
 first feature that I traced on the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.150
 canvas I center the elastic well 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.410
 europe and thanks to the tiles 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.620
 schoolchildren I fix the elastic on the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.030
 canvas with a piece of tape 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.369
 like this 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.000
 last step I sting either the width 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.030
 rubber band making sure to make a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.030
 back point on each end for 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.410
 solidify the seam that's the result 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 I have 12 spaces in which I am going 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.600
 able to house my pencils
