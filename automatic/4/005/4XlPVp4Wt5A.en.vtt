00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.839
 the nissan tiida is located in one of the most competitive segments of the market 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.160
 Mexican 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.400
 therefore, in order to gain a good position within him, one must have 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.970
 with a series of attributes in terms of mechanical comfort and design 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.220
 noteworthy in this long-term test with the ajax bayern tiida 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.409
 we have traveled a little over three thousand 500 kilometers 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.380
 most of them in place 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.640
 and although the car is not the most complete in equipment 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.059
 the urgent plan removed the Aztecs 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.800
 more good things than bad 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 subtle motor consisting of a four-cylinder engine 1 point 8 liters of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.680
 displacement 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.230
 delivers a power of 125 horsepower and a torque of 128 foot pounds 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.080
 in everyday life are enough to give the author 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 an answer here and with enough 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.260
 but without any concern 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.080
 however much of this successful performance of the tyrant was 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 attributed to the manual six relations 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 thanks to its high because available to step 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 notwithstanding the virtues of this box 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.840
 Suriel of changes is not as accurate 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.350
 and must accompany each change during almost the entire journey to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.070
 prevent inaccuracies 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.010
 besides that it's too soft and it also rocks too 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.640
 interested assertion 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.159
 in these little more than three thousand 500 kilometers the titan has given us a 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.200
 quite acceptable consumption 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.660
 taking into account the height of the city of mexico and the driving style to which 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.240
 has been submitted percent reaching an average of 8 points 4 kilometers 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.620
 per liter in the city 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.620
 and 13 points 6 on the road 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.100
 four of his pensions consisting of macpherson at the head of the quintet 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.560
 national back 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 the formula results effective enough to both absorb the multiple 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.010
 road imperfections 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.280
 as to dare at high speeds through the streets 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.089
 the same we can say about your braking system 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.089
 composed of discs to the front and drums back 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.549
 there is no complaint and they do not show great symptoms of fatigue when they are required 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.129
 Faster 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.479
 braking 80 steel 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.859
 the reason only 20 points 70 meters 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.219
 the generals 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.209
 it's a car that endures 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.599
 intense city 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 It is comfortable and its design is modern and pleasant 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.729
 we will talk about this long-term test in our next report
