bi-directional all from turning let's

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.509 
bi-directional all from turning let's
see<00:02:20.450> up<00:02:20.900> double<00:02:21.680> back<00:02:21.829> actually<00:02:24.100> all<00:02:25.100> from

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519

see up double back actually all from
turning<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.060> switch<00:02:26.450> right<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.140> get

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290

you can go to all those polar patterns

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.870 
you can go to all those polar patterns
which<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.410> great<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.310> if<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.700> this

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.510 
and the microphone i'll try to unboxings
of<00:05:11.930> these<00:05:12.080> separately<00:05:12.590> because<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:13.400> way

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
of these separately because that way

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.010 
of these separately because that way
later<00:05:14.060> on<00:05:14.270> down<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.450> road<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.840> looks<00:05:14.990> that

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
later on down the road so it looks that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.050 
later on down the road so it looks that
they<00:05:15.229> don't<00:05:15.380> flick<00:05:15.530> through<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.710> whole

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
they don't flick through the whole

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.730 
they don't flick through the whole
unboxing<00:05:17.060> process<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:18.200> put<00:05:18.320> into<00:05:18.500> another

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
unboxing process and put into another

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.730 
unboxing process and put into another
part<00:05:19.539> anyways<00:05:20.539> that's<00:05:20.870> about<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.169> I'll<00:05:21.680> talk

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740
