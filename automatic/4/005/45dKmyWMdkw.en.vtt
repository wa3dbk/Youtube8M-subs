00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
now you see right now there are deform

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
now you see right now there are deform
fanatics<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.799> these<00:02:41.010> guys<00:02:41.250> are<00:02:41.310> dangerous

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
fanatics now these guys are dangerous

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.869 
fanatics now these guys are dangerous
they<00:02:42.390> walk<00:02:42.660> slowly<00:02:43.049> however<00:02:43.769> they<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.400> hefty

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
they walk slowly however they do a hefty

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.300

amount<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.269> damage<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.099> see<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
amount of damage and so if you see a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.880 
amount of damage and so if you see a
tank<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:48.170> really<00:02:49.170> close<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.590> them<00:02:49.739> or

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
tank that's really close to them or

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.720 
tank that's really close to them or
tanking<00:02:50.849> them<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.549> if<00:02:53.549> you're

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
tanking them then you have to if you're

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.509 
tanking them then you have to if you're
far<00:02:53.940> enough<00:02:54.209> away<00:02:54.920> distracting<00:02:55.920> shot<00:02:56.129> them<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
far enough away distracting shot them so

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.920 
far enough away distracting shot them so
that<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.819> can<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.120> them<00:02:57.269> away<00:02:57.450> from<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.690> tank

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that you can get them away from the tank

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.289 
that you can get them away from the tank
and<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> tank<00:02:59.549> can<00:02:59.640> start<00:02:59.970> running<00:03:00.090> away

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and so the tank can start running away

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.720 
and so the tank can start running away
to<00:03:00.870> build<00:03:01.109> up<00:03:01.290> distance<00:03:01.829> between<00:03:02.040> them<00:03:02.489> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
to build up distance between them and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.460 
to build up distance between them and
everyone<00:03:03.180> else<00:03:03.480> needs<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.290> focus<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.980> those<00:03:05.700> um

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
everyone else needs to focus on those um

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.839 
everyone else needs to focus on those um
deform<00:03:07.470> fanatics<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.129> take<00:03:08.340> them<00:03:08.489> down

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
deform fanatics to take them down

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.000 
deform fanatics to take them down
and<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.650> kill<00:03:10.889> order<00:03:11.160> should<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:13.230> e1

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
