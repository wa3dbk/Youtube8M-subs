graphics so guys it's a moderate step up
with<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.350> part<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> main<00:00:41.640> thing<00:00:41.670> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
with that part but the main thing is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
with that part but the main thing is
that<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.329> has<00:00:42.420> been<00:00:42.510> totally<00:00:42.930> redesigned<00:00:43.079> with

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
that it has been totally redesigned with
a<00:00:43.559> very<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.309> cool<00:00:44.550> unibody<00:00:45.000> look<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
a very very cool unibody look I'm so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
a very very cool unibody look I'm so
guys<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.590> even<00:00:47.039> thinner<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:47.399> knowing<00:00:47.730> 1.5

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
guys it's even thinner now knowing 1.5

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.650 
guys it's even thinner now knowing 1.5
inches<00:00:48.600> tall<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:50.010> also<00:00:50.309> add<00:00:50.700> hdmi<00:00:51.449> out

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
inches tall and then also add hdmi out

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
inches tall and then also add hdmi out
so<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.890> even<00:00:53.219> better

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
so this is going to be an even better

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
so this is going to be an even better
solution<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> already<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> mac<00:00:55.350> mini

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
solution if you already have a mac mini

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
solution if you already have a mac mini
me<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> hooking<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.850> big

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
me are you hooking it up to you know big

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
me are you hooking it up to you know big
screen<00:00:57.510> TV<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.989> whatever<00:00:58.140> well<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> has

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
screen TV or whatever well now that has

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.849 
screen TV or whatever well now that has
hdmi<00:00:59.940> i'll<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.210> even<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.379> there

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hdmi i'll be even better because there

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
hdmi i'll be even better because there
are<00:01:01.980> some<00:01:02.129> downsides<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> price

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
are some downsides and that the price

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
are some downsides and that the price
has<00:01:03.719> gone<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> base<00:01:05.040> Mac<00:01:05.309> Mini<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.610> now

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
has gone up so the base Mac Mini is now

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
has gone up so the base Mac Mini is now
six<00:01:06.150> hundred<00:01:06.390> ninety<00:01:06.570> nine<00:01:06.659> dollars<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
six hundred ninety nine dollars which is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
six hundred ninety nine dollars which is
100<00:01:07.740> hours<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.040> expensive<00:01:08.520> than<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> old

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
100 hours more expensive than the old

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
100 hours more expensive than the old
