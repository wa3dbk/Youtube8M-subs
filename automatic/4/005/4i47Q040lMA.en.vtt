 after melting and what's next 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.200
 further pressing the truth cane and we 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 we get this little thing here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.620
 written play using space jump 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.640

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.870
 the spacebar and in I even like all so 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.770
 let's see what it is click 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.740
 space is considered sound left 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.439
 on right 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.439
 down up 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.080
 Well, such a thing is the same here there are five 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.060
 things that are not 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.270
 game on adventure mode is not entered then 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.119
 is they available only in creative 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.560
 this song is time song storm song 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.390
 sun song treatment or health and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.110
 Zelda glory and not know how to translate 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.030
 but if we know combinations of these 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.850
 leaflets then we can play 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.530
 but unfortunately that is here and click 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.210
 songs of time that is nothing 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.429
 happens it generally happens well 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.679
 just not already this is all studied that is 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.580
 here it is written that clarke learned the day 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.789
 blue lobby read a book of some kind 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.450
 there learned the song storm songs in time 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.950
 and so on but of course I can see 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.470
 but it is now not to foresee this in 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 browser let's see this 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:34.170

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.880
 so nice sound 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.880
 and the melody is played 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.890
 and it's gorgeous but it was a song of time 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.040
 not a single moment of effect but in the future 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.840
 author 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.790

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.160
 leaves they will be from residents 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 succumb to looking in chests and 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:09.500
 just make up our song 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.439

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.959
 down up right down 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:00.700
 yes it works with song sun we have 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.550
 we are done at sunset so where are we 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.190
 to the sun 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:14.100
 time set next will be the song treatment 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.100
 probably what was left there beforehand 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:28.800
 well beyond the exceptions the truth is there 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.800

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.900
 Said added very much and removes 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.220
 negative effects but does not treat well 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.980
 if searched disappeared 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.980
