now<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.450> when<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.959> first<00:03:28.560> had<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.950> bike<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
now on when we first had the bike a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.509 
now on when we first had the bike a
dynamometer<00:03:30.180> run<00:03:30.709> showed<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> bike<00:03:32.250> had
