00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:18.169
 What's going on in klitzschen and september 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.410
 Get your vehicles back here today 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.679
 duplicate and even solo the people 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.539
 glitch internet again really easy 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.609
 boxer yesterday patched this glitsch 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.650
 I have uploaded or that 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.050
 I only partially worked 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.140
 I thought again a solo one 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.140
 eclipse in I at a forum here 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.780
 I read and thought I 'll take it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.370
 the immediately yes what in any case 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 You need a garage for that 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.800
 which is full with me in the case is the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.400
 full gage the unit 2 garage that will 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.220
 I also show you these just 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.190
 here is full of any cars 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.140
 step up and out of the upper garage 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.170
 the upshot is that I duplicate 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.509
 So my panto in my case for 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.249
 recommend duplicated pantos though 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.979
 or completely because the vehicles over 

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.999
 You can pay $ 100,000 in purchase 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.219
 do not sell 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:15.950
 because there is such a mistake 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.560
 then we order the panther 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.990
 the teaching rage that is where 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 at least one parking space is when he is there 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.799
 we drive to the santos 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 arrived there today you have one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.720
 remote-controlled bomb then turn to it 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.880
 we go down there to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.189
 explosive and remote-controlled bomb 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 Unfortunately, you have to be 50 cents for it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.140
 I think everyone should go immediately 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.729
 reader so it suits you if you like that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 I then made off party to the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.850
 full garage that is where if you purely 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 would drive where the ad would come 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.970
 where the garage of the full press iks 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.550
 to change cars 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.039
 then you come out the garages takes 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.950
 on mobile phone and calls the bomb 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.869
 as soon as you start your drive and shortly before 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 The garage then pressed iks to call 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.030
 so iks call ancestors come now 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.470
 then this warning will explode 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.350
 Now we come out again what she 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.600
 now you have to do is get people you pick 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.610
 any car what you get in the garage 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.190
 can drive and rides to the teachers 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.190
 especially if it could be tomorrow 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
 call 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.490
 then we come here in my case 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 upstairs in the empty garages at the russos 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.140
 Mitchell and as soon as you the the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.390
 see panther on the map I show 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.040
 here you have the panther again 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 you just in the garage with a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.110
 Road vehicle with a 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.390
 Road vehicle so once we are here 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.250
 we see that they are just a few 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.160
 pitches we go to the blue 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.260
 circle something is coming to me now 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.770
 actually personally really desperate 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 there you see account later then changes 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.400
 you have the places with you 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.440
 some fucking shit 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.900
 and then you can already see why 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.000
 is a new panther so by the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.709
 sense of this road vehicle is a 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.680
 Brand I know how to do that 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.310
 but let's just leave it in 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.930
 things wehrendorf well I think great 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.190
 Well, let's talk 3 now 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.630
 have now benefited a vehicle 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.630
 now we see the panther on the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.280
 card to lure him faster 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.860
 I would recommend you just start 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.900
 just any contact with mission 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.489
 me in the case namely times gerald in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.330
 State now with reliability 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.970
 again 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.790
 Now the panther should be in front of you 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.950
 or in your environment so with me in that 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.019
 case he stands there what you have to do now 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.480
 you have to go back to the andes now 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.769
 drive customs and change your plaque 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.720
 because this part has to be 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.720
 different from what you duplicate 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 came here in Lausanne 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.790
 Let's just go to license plates and 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.790
 buy us other license plates 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 easy 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:08.349
 now , university japan 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.349
 benefits 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.410
 and here you are, if you are one of them 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.150
 party instead of here from inside that is 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.480
 we're just a few of you and the house 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.060
 but so good and really easy that 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.690
 a committee of me are looking forward to it 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.760
 that she has fallen without the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.550
 description for the informative links 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.550
 and a fire website
