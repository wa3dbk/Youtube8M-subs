00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.100
 a little sworn troop 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.050
 within the team goalkeeper 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.420
 Maintain a very special 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.820
 training everyday and a very special 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.380
 intimacy inevitably during 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.199
 Field players are training in groups 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.390
 the pine always be with entree 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.330
 a mission the ball in front of the line 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 keep at all costs with all means 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.280
 technical training with all 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.149
 auxiliaries 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.339
 Basically it is so that we ourselves 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.870
 people always very close to the game too 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.940
 orient the technical processes 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.479
 what is tactical behavior 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.879
 As and additionally I try then 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.409
 again and again to incorporate elements around 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.379
 to put in higher appeal 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.059
 so for example the eyelet at 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.859
 It is the belief that this is the goal 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.159
 it is simple that we see the peripheral 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.369
 the perception try to exercise 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:04.720
 and if we just cover one eye 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:06.700
 It will increase this price of 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.220
 the eye flap to the medicine ball to 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.410
 Bleiweste to the stopper creativity 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.240
 is in demand to create something unusual 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.680
 to put new stimuli 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.170
 goalkeeping coach michael calculator wants 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.690
 his keeper is constantly calling for and with it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.190
 promote 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.420
 In any case, blind trust in me 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 Of course, unusual exercise sometimes 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.610
 but everything with an ulterior motive everything 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.530
 always agreed explains something 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.890
 he intends to replace what is important 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.990
 and then we do it very well 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.910
 Trust is right in the trainers 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.040
 the training and at the end in your own 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.960
 Skills the keeper must have one 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.970
 have good wire to your trainer 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.170
 same wavelength the training 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
 accept accept 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.780
 this also decides in case of doubt 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.890
 between goalie and parade 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.650
 that is very important because the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 group has already said very little 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.409
 We work in threes and in the selection 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.580
 The individual parts is extremely important 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.140
 that both the athletic quality 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.610
 But that is also extremely high 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.430
 human's personal relationship 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.999
 because you just everyday very tight 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.129
 works together then builds 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.159
 Of course, always a relationship with you 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.519
 has great confidence one talks about 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.599
 individual situation about individual cases 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.450
 yes sometimes for minutes 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.260
 And so a good relationship builds up 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.659
 and that's the case with me michael 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.879
 calculator was even goalkeeper profi under 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.939
 Others at the HSV and the SV Waldhof 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.579
 mannheim exercise forms of the brand 08 15 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.409
 not necessarily his passion and 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.879
 so it can happen that oliver baumann 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.019
 sometimes a real one makes a lot of 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.870
 many thoughts 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.139
 The goalkeeper game is very wide 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.129
 you have to be very many 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.749
 install techniques from the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.879
 opening the player via an impression 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.549
 one-on-one room defense 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.459
 that's a lot of elements and that's trying 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.409
 you just keep integrating 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 and of course you also exchange ideas 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.609
 one or two colleagues sometimes 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.900
 Looks at other sports 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.690
 tries athletic components with 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.210
 and then you have it 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.280
 relatively large exercise Pohl and out of the 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.170
 core business are always adapted 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.900
 team training and game forms of 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.390
 markus gisdol the red thread is important 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:35.140
 the traceability can only be that way 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:37.780
 Trust arises the mental I think 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.710
 Being a place is very very important feels 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.770
 Everything in the head off 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.470
 you have the exercise or the movement all 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.750
 Made 1000 times and then you have to cool 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.270
 remain in the play it needs to be 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.590
 Apply the right situation 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.420
 that's the hardest of me 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.000
 goalkeeper a particularly complex 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.370
 position in modern football therefore a 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.350
 particularly high requirement potential 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.890
 not exclusively technical and 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.560
 have tactical with aliens and and alex 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.020
 we are also a towering group of what 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.150
 it's human and all three 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.560
 work at an absolutely high level and it 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.210
 makes a lot of fun then too 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.390
 the group with the boys every day 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.070
 work because he just because you like 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.140
 On together is in the square and also 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.630
 has a lot of fun and that is extremely important 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.530
 that interpersonal just plays 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.330
 also a role 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.240
 especially in such sworn ones 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.240
 Communities like goalkeepers are
