leverage in the banking system which

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300 
leverage in the banking system which
I've<00:00:18.960> expressed<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.710> view<00:00:19.949> over<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.100> last

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I've expressed that view over the last

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.349 
I've expressed that view over the last
decade<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.529> look<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.090> inability<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
decade I look at the inability of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.150 
decade I look at the inability of
governments<00:00:25.080> who<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.500> spending<00:00:25.769> vast

in<00:00:29.130> GDP<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.939> fact<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:31.140> been<00:00:31.289> some

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
in GDP in fact there's been some

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.700 
in GDP in fact there's been some
excellent<00:00:31.710> work<00:00:31.949> done<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.710> marginal

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
excellent work done on how the marginal

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
excellent work done on how the marginal
value<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> government<00:00:35.520> dollar<00:00:35.880> spent<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
value of a government dollar spent is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
value of a government dollar spent is
now<00:00:36.690> negative<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:38.040> give<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
now negative I could give you the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
now negative I could give you the
example<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.879> running<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> 1.5<00:00:39.989> trillion<00:00:40.320> dollar

deficit last year and GDP goes up 200
billion<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.850> we're<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.059> getting<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.480> bang

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
billion so we're not getting much bang

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
billion so we're not getting much bang
for<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.020> buck<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.649> still<00:00:46.829> owe<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> buck<00:00:47.309> at

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
for a buck but we still owe the buck at

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
for a buck but we still owe the buck at
the<00:00:47.610> end<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> year<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.809> will<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200

end<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.559> year<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> very<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.489> worried

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
end of this year so I very much worried

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
end of this year so I very much worried
about<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.590> also<00:00:52.590> worry<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.340> what's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
lending the latest data in March showed

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
lending the latest data in March showed
that<00:01:01.800> landings<00:01:02.160> gone<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.489> 300<00:01:03.030> billion<00:01:03.270> in

that landings gone from 300 billion in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
that landings gone from 300 billion in
the<00:01:03.629> month<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.470> hundred<00:01:04.799> billion<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the month to a hundred billion right and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
the month to a hundred billion right and
I<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.150> look<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.420> 200<00:01:06.810> billion<00:01:07.140> less<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> month

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
I just look at 200 billion less a month

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.719 
I just look at 200 billion less a month
that's<00:01:08.580> 2.4<00:01:09.320> trillion<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.530> year<00:01:10.560> less<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.520> there

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that's 2.4 trillion a year less if there

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
that's 2.4 trillion a year less if there
was<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.119> stay<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.479> way<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.320> obviously<00:01:13.799> has

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
was to stay that way and obviously has

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
was to stay that way and obviously has
to<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.460> effect<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> their<00:01:15.000> economy<00:01:15.420> as

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to have an effect on their economy as

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
to have an effect on their economy as
the<00:01:15.780> lending<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> two<00:01:17.220> trillion<00:01:17.520> did

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the lending of two trillion did

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
the lending of two trillion did
positively<00:01:18.479> last<00:01:18.750> year<00:01:18.960> yeah<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.320> big

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
positively last year yeah these are big

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
positively last year yeah these are big
numbers<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> think<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.330> idea

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
numbers so do you think that the idea

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
numbers so do you think that the idea
that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.200> China<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> rising<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.460> much

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that you know China is rising so much

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
that you know China is rising so much
and<00:01:24.090> we've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.600> demand<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> that's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and we've got all this demand and that's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.850 
and we've got all this demand and that's
really<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:25.950> riding<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:27.119> wave<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.860> you're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
really been riding this wave of you're

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
really been riding this wave of you're
making<00:01:29.250> money<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> commodity<00:01:30.060> space<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
making money in the commodity space and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
making money in the commodity space and
some<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> producers<00:01:31.170> yeah<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> think

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
some of the producers yeah you think

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
some of the producers yeah you think
that<00:01:32.220> should<00:01:32.430> slowing<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:33.960> when

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that should slowing down now well when

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.640 
that should slowing down now well when
you<00:01:34.409> look<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.979> China<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.520> 09<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> four

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you look back at China in 09 had a four

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
you look back at China in 09 had a four
trillion<00:01:37.920> dollar<00:01:38.220> economy<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:39.479> lent<00:01:39.840> two

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

obviously<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.000> kind<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.330> an<00:04:25.420> offshoot<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.990> gold

in fact I think silver will act better
than<00:04:28.750> gold<00:04:29.020> there's<00:04:29.770> not<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.160> much<00:04:30.280> silver

in

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.650 
in
we<00:06:12.830> probably<00:06:13.100> have<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.400> most<00:06:13.660> levered

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
we probably have the most levered

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.270 
we probably have the most levered
position<00:06:15.170> to<00:06:15.320> those<00:06:15.500> products<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:16.160> you

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
position to those products that you

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.710 
position to those products that you
could<00:06:16.430> possibly<00:06:16.610> imagine<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:17.390> don't<00:06:17.540> see

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
could possibly imagine and you don't see

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.330 
could possibly imagine and you don't see
a<00:06:17.750> cattle<00:06:18.140> I<00:06:18.230> mean<00:06:18.380> what's<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.710> catalyst<00:06:19.130> trim

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
a cattle I mean what's the catalyst trim

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.830 
a cattle I mean what's the catalyst trim
but<00:06:19.460> you<00:06:19.580> move<00:06:19.730> stock<00:06:20.000> slower<00:06:20.270> I<00:06:20.450> mean<00:06:20.630> I<00:06:20.660> know

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
but you move stock slower I mean I know

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.210 
but you move stock slower I mean I know
you're<00:06:21.080> looking<00:06:21.170> for<00:06:21.470> this<00:06:21.560> market<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:21.980> crack

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
you're looking for this market to crack

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.430 
you're looking for this market to crack
but<00:06:22.250> well<00:06:22.700> I<00:06:22.730> think<00:06:22.910> if<00:06:23.240> they<00:06:23.660> have<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.170> problem

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
but well I think if they have a problem

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.610 
but well I think if they have a problem
of<00:06:25.160> slowing<00:06:25.670> in<00:06:25.760> China<00:06:26.060> happened<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:27.440> you

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
of slowing in China happened and you

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.790 
of slowing in China happened and you
know<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.800> Chinese<00:06:27.980> market<00:06:28.310> peaked<00:06:28.670> out<00:06:28.850> in

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
know the Chinese market peaked out in

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.770 
know the Chinese market peaked out in
august<00:06:30.800> of<00:06:30.890> last<00:06:30.950> year<00:06:31.280> yeah<00:06:31.670> hasn't<00:06:32.660> gone

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
august of last year yeah hasn't gone

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.890 
august of last year yeah hasn't gone
anywhere<00:06:33.040> their<00:06:34.040> market<00:06:34.550> doesn't<00:06:35.270> look<00:06:35.660> like

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
anywhere their market doesn't look like

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.080 
anywhere their market doesn't look like
it's<00:06:36.080> buying<00:06:36.680> into<00:06:37.040> the<00:06:37.160> Chinese<00:06:37.400> experience

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
it's buying into the Chinese experience

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.520 
it's buying into the Chinese experience
as<00:06:38.210> much<00:06:38.360> as<00:06:38.510> we're<00:06:38.660> buying<00:06:38.900> it<00:06:38.990> Chinese

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
as much as we're buying it Chinese

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.190 
as much as we're buying it Chinese
experience<00:06:40.010> and<00:06:40.100> then
