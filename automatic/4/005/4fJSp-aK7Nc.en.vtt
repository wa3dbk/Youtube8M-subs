00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 so I wanted to say something short here again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.580
 before the video is really that correct 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.830
 I start and have followed for you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.769
 Warendorf when I entered and shopping 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 was and I took you with it 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 because that was the first place in high demand at 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.389
 Secondly, I think of you anyway 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 do 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.199
 and yes I have the video now 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 decorated and I have to say is one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 a bit shaky and yes it is just 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 just the first of public viewing 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 but not so easy for me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.769
 So I have to work a bit more 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
 get used to it and therefore think please 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 that it is only following me around and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 I still hope that's disgusting 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 I like it but I also wanted to say it 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 I'm sorry first video cares ends 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.280
 but I have a file provided 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 deleted and therefore the end of the very good 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.300
 Answer is just beginning and saying 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 I still hope that many of you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.469

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.600

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.130

 could have a nice coffee 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.850

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.600
 because I filmed myself so much 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.570

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.740
