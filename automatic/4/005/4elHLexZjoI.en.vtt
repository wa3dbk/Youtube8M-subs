one left one Center and one right the
reason<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.480> because<00:00:33.690> there's<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
reason for that is because there's a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.510 
reason for that is because there's a
brass<00:00:35.100> gear<00:00:35.780> brass<00:00:36.780> bushing<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.800> inside

hours<00:00:41.750> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.050> distributor<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.829> three

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
hours on the distributor there's three

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.470 
hours on the distributor there's three
