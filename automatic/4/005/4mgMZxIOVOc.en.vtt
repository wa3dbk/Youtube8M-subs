got<00:05:52.259> a<00:05:52.500> dirty<00:05:53.009> dancing<00:05:54.680> it's<00:05:55.680> right<00:05:55.979> here<00:05:58.130> this

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
got a dirty dancing it's right here this

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.580 
got a dirty dancing it's right here this
one<00:05:59.310> actually<00:05:59.580> has<00:05:59.849> gigantic<00:06:00.509> purple<00:06:01.320> burst

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
one actually has gigantic purple burst

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.439 
one actually has gigantic purple burst
or<00:06:01.919> triple<00:06:02.370> bursts<00:06:04.789> which<00:06:05.789> means<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.240> blows<00:06:06.419> up

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449
