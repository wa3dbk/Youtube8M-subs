take<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.130> look<00:00:47.310> at<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.460> chart<00:00:47.670> developed

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
take a look at this chart developed

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.780 
take a look at this chart developed
about<00:00:48.450> 100<00:00:48.810> years<00:00:48.899> ago<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.500> clearly<00:00:49.890> shows<00:00:50.220> us

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
about 100 years ago it clearly shows us

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.549 
about 100 years ago it clearly shows us
grade<00:00:51.060> pepper<00:00:51.300> spray<00:00:51.630> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> second<00:00:52.380> hottest

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
grade pepper spray is the second hottest

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
grade pepper spray is the second hottest
type<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.100> pepper<00:00:53.280> even<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.450> diluted<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
type of pepper even if it's diluted and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
type of pepper even if it's diluted and
to<00:00:55.410> put<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:55.829> perspective<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to put that into perspective it's a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
to put that into perspective it's a
thousand<00:00:57.540> times<00:00:57.690> hotter<00:00:58.050> than<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.350> jalapeno

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
thousand times hotter than a jalapeno

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.670 
thousand times hotter than a jalapeno
it's<00:00:59.700> a<00:00:59.790> food<00:01:00.000> product<00:01:00.239> essentially

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 

it's<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.670> food<00:01:08.850> product<00:01:09.120> essentially<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's a food product essentially but a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's a food product essentially but a
lot<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> experts<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.830> looking<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
lot of experts are looking at that and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
lot of experts are looking at that and
saying<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.730> that<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> real<00:01:12.180> deal<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> been

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
saying is that the real deal has it been

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
saying is that the real deal has it been
diluted<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.910> should<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.330> should

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
diluted because that should they should

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.500 
diluted because that should they should
have<00:01:15.690> more<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.110> reality<00:01:16.380> yeah<00:01:20.510> orange

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
have more of a reality yeah orange

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.940 
have more of a reality yeah orange

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
netting they're trying to corral the
people<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> police<00:01:23.700> say<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.690> were

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
people the police say look they were

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
people the police say look they were
blocking<00:01:25.080> pedestrian<00:01:25.740> traffic<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> they

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
blocking pedestrian traffic and they

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.400 
blocking pedestrian traffic and they
were<00:01:26.400> blocking<00:01:26.700> vehicle<00:01:27.240> traffic<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
were blocking vehicle traffic and we

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.719 
were blocking vehicle traffic and we
were<00:01:28.590> trying<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> corral<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
were trying to corral them so that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
were trying to corral them so that
traffic<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.330> go<00:01:30.479> through<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> trying<00:01:31.080> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
traffic could go through and trying to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
traffic could go through and trying to
sort<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> maintain<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> sense<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> order<00:01:32.310> now

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
sort of maintain a sense of order now

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
sort of maintain a sense of order now
you<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.080> guess<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you see that then then I guess it's the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
you see that then then I guess it's the
pepper<00:01:34.680> spray<00:01:34.920> happens<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.550> there<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
