tissue<00:03:43.300> in<00:03:43.690> ways<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.200> cannot<00:03:44.500> yet<00:03:44.710> explain<00:03:45.160> but

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
tissue in ways I cannot yet explain but

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.030 
tissue in ways I cannot yet explain but
you<00:03:45.970> are<00:03:46.390> evidence<00:03:46.960> of<00:03:47.170> its<00:03:47.440> remarkable

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
you are evidence of its remarkable

you are evidence of its remarkable
powers

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.050 

ah<00:04:02.600> yes<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.430> reason<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
ah yes that is the reason you and I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.180 
ah yes that is the reason you and I
having<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.600> conversation<00:04:06.990> Phillip<00:04:07.740> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
having this conversation Phillip the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.610 
having this conversation Phillip the
sole<00:04:08.490> reason<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:09.330> because<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.810> energy<00:04:10.350> l<00:04:11.180> well

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
sole reason is because of energy l well

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
sole reason is because of energy l well
to<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.770> specific<00:04:14.310> energy<00:04:15.000> l<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.600> life

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
to be specific energy l and the life

it back on the shelf obviously

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.350 
it back on the shelf obviously
more<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:28.920> crystal<00:04:29.520> than<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.940> doctor

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
more to this crystal than the doctor

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.530 
more to this crystal than the doctor
wants<00:04:30.660> me<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.840> know<00:04:31.460> I'll<00:04:32.460> examine<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.150> again

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
wants me to know I'll examine it again

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.350 
wants me to know I'll examine it again
later<00:04:33.840> when<00:04:34.710> he<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:34.980> more<00:04:35.250> deeply<00:04:35.790> into<00:04:36.060> his
