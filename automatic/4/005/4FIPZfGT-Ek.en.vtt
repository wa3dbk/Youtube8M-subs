00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 ago 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.179
 millions of years the last one became extinct 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 dinosaur not aviary like the 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 gigantic mosasaurs and plesiosaurs 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.320
 in the seas and the pterosaurs in the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.199
 Heavens 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 the plankton the base of the chain 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 food from the ocean was very 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 affected many brachiopod families 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.510
 and sea sponges disappeared the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 remaining hard shell ammonites are 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 the great diversity was reduced 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 of sharks wilted most 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.149
 of the vegetation in brief was eliminated 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.840
 more than half of the species 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 world 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 what caused this massive extinction that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.590
 marks the end of the Cretaceous and the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.910
 beginning of the paleogene the scientists 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.640
 have not yet found an answer 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.850
 whoever gets it should explain why 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 these animals died while the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 most mammals turtles 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.100
 crocodiles salamanders and frogs 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.399
 they survived the birds were spared 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.210
 same as bivalve snakes and 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.780
 sea ​​urchins and starfish including 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.080
 resistant plants capable of supporting 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 extreme weather did well the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.410
 scientists usually coincide around 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.880
 two hypotheses that could explain the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.220
 extinction of the Cretaceous an impact 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.009
 extraterrestrial for example an asteroid 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 or a comet or a large period 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.819
 volcanic activity any of the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 two scenarios would have drowned the heavens 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.490
 with remains that deprived the land of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.340
 the sun's energy preventing the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.250
 photosynthesis and extending the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.610
 destruction up and down the chain 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.240
 food once the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.790
 dust the greenhouse gases or 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.970
 blocked in the atmosphere would have 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.910
 caused that the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.370
 temperature a sudden change 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.800
 climatic ended a lot of life that 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.569
 managed to survive the prolonged 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.770
 dark asteroid or volcanoes the theory 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.540
 of the extraterrestrial impact comes from 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.390
 discovery that a rock stratum 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.080
 dating precisely from the time of the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.660
 extinction is very rich in iridium this 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.990
 stratum is found throughout the planet 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.960
 on land and in the oceans 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.900
 iridium is rare on earth but it 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.680
 found in the meteorites with the same 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.590
 concentration that in this video this 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.200
 led the scientists to affirm that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.200
 iridium spread across the planet 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 when a comet or an asteroid fell in 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 somewhere on earth already 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.350
 then a crater of 180 was evaporated 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.770
 kilometers wide formed in the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.650
 Yucatan peninsula of Mexico called 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.970
 chicxulub has been discovered since 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.180
 and then it sets your age 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.660
 65 million years many scientists 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.680
 they believe that radioactive fallout caused 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.810
 by the impact he killed the dinosaurs 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.900
 but the core of the earth is also 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.020
 a rich in iridium and the core is the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.110
 origin of magma that some scientists 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.350
 they claim that pretty in huge torrents 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.120
 that were piled up in more than 24 kilometers 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.060
 of width about 2 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.209
 6 million square kilometers of the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.269
 india this period of activity 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.140
 volcanic has also been calculated that 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.959
 It occurred 65 million years ago and 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.260
 I would have spread the iridium all over the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 planet together with the dust that hid 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.560
 sunlight and the gases of effect 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.760
 greenhouse both hypotheses are 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.070
 meritorious some scientists believe that 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.850
 both may have contributed to the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.970
 extinction and others suggest that the cause 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.690
 real was a more gradual change of climate 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.780
 and sea level independently 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.930
 of what caused the extinction marked the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.210
 end of the Tyrannosaurus reign of terror 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.600
 rex and opened the door for 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:00.990
 mammals and they will diversify quickly and 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.990
 evolved into newly opened niches
