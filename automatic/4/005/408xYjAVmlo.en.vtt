00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.639 
and then we'll blend it and a grease
pencil<00:00:40.129> definitely<00:00:41.129> does<00:00:41.600> move<00:00:42.600> around<00:00:42.899> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
doesn't need to be perfect since the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.140 
doesn't need to be perfect since the
look<00:01:09.240> doesn't<00:01:09.659> call<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.369> could

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
look doesn't call for it and you could

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.950 
look doesn't call for it and you could
definitely<00:01:12.979> do<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.310> dark<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.030> big<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.869> as

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
definitely do this dark as big or as

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
definitely do this dark as big or as
little<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> wanted<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> could<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
little as you wanted you could just do a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
little as you wanted you could just do a
line<00:01:18.060> close<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> lashes<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.100> smudge<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
line close the lashes and then smudge it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
line close the lashes and then smudge it
where<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
where you can go all the way up if you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
where you can go all the way up if you
wanted<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> we're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> split

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
wanted to we're going to kind of split

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
wanted to we're going to kind of split
the<00:01:24.450> difference<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the difference here I'm going to do it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.340 
the difference here I'm going to do it
on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> bottom<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.350> draw

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
on the bottom as well so you just draw

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
on the bottom as well so you just draw
it<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.159> smudge<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:37.280> like<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it on and then you smudge it I like to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:52.040 
it on and then you smudge it I like to
bring<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.409> good<00:01:40.409> amount

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.400 

and<00:01:52.620> since<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.040> pencil<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.880> creamy<00:01:54.410> it

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
and since this pencil is so creamy it

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:04.430 
and since this pencil is so creamy it
will<00:01:55.740> move<00:01:55.950> fairly<00:01:56.670> easy<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.260> also

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
will move fairly easy and then I'm also
