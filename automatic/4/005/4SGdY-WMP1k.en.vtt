is doing so I called Burton and they
seem<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> part<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
seem to think that this is part of the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.080 
seem to think that this is part of the
tech<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.570> Flex<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.350> these<00:00:19.770> bindings<00:00:20.520> so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
tech and the Flex and these bindings so

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.279 
tech and the Flex and these bindings so
I'll<00:00:21.210> let<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> all<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> judge<00:00:21.750> specially

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
so from here the heel binding is mounted

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.780 
so from here the heel binding is mounted
and<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> 4<00:00:30.810> by<00:00:30.929> 4<00:00:30.960> plate<00:00:31.650> that's<00:00:32.550> in

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and it's the 4 by 4 plate that's in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
and it's the 4 by 4 plate that's in
there<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.469> heel<00:00:34.620> bed<00:00:34.829> popped

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
there so I have the the heel bed popped

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.389 
there so I have the the heel bed popped
up<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.579> well<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.690> here's<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> flex<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
up as well so here's the flex so if you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.720 
up as well so here's the flex so if you
hold<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> board<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.590> pull<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.430> board

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
hold the board down and pull the board

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.069 
hold the board down and pull the board
you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> binding<00:00:42.570> flex<00:00:42.809> hopefully

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you can see the binding flex hopefully

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
you can see the binding flex hopefully
you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.739> video<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.450> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you can see it on this video here so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
you can see it on this video here so
this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> pulling<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.670> how

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this is pulling it up so you can see how

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
this is pulling it up so you can see how
much<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> flexes<00:00:48.920> from<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> board<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
much it flexes from the board to the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
much it flexes from the board to the
binding<00:00:52.620> itself<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> smaller<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:54.120> disc<00:00:54.750> in

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
binding itself or the smaller up disc in

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
binding itself or the smaller up disc in
it<00:00:55.370> if<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.789> come<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.090> further<00:00:58.609> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it if you actually come in further you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.160 
it if you actually come in further you
can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.120> desk<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:00.899> you're<00:01:01.020> pulling

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
can see the desk and when you're pulling

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.880 
can see the desk and when you're pulling
up<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.920> hard<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> judge<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.710> not

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
up on it just hard to judge it's not

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
up on it just hard to judge it's not
really<00:01:05.129> flexing<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> disc<00:01:05.760> too<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
really flexing the disc too much but the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.240 
really flexing the disc too much but the
disc<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:07.020> flex<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
disc does flex a little bit but the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
disc does flex a little bit but the
whole<00:01:08.369> base<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> binding<00:01:09.150> flexes<00:01:09.630> from

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
whole base of the binding flexes from

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
whole base of the binding flexes from
the<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> looks<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.159> Burton's<00:01:11.580> actually

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the way it looks like Burton's actually

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.990 
the way it looks like Burton's actually
saying<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> post<00:01:12.720> tail<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> there's<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
saying it's a post tail so there's a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
saying it's a post tail so there's a
pretty<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.420> flesh<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.380> pulling

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
pretty good flesh but if you're pulling

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
pretty good flesh but if you're pulling
up<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.909> forcing<00:01:18.180> your

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
up on it with your you know forcing your

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.280 
up on it with your you know forcing your
hand<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.189> strapped<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.110> get<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
hand so you got strapped in to get the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
hand so you got strapped in to get the
boot<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> show<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:37.579> let's<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.640> set<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
boot here and show to let's go set the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.660

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.510 
backhand
lean<00:01:41.670> forward<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.210> well<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.920 

combining<00:01:50.520> flexes<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.330> doesn't<00:01:51.660> feel

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
combining flexes but it doesn't feel

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
combining flexes but it doesn't feel
like<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.460> like<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> findings<00:01:54.240> leaves

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
like I'm like the findings leaves

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.400 
like I'm like the findings leaves
towards<00:01:54.900> truth<00:01:55.170> flexed<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.800> mean<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.190> way<00:01:56.370> it

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
towards truth flexed I mean the way it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.660 
towards truth flexed I mean the way it
seems<00:01:58.410> they<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.650> supposed<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:02.610> all

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
at the reflex bindings hopefully this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.620 
at the reflex bindings hopefully this
kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.490> shed<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:08.910> light<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> reflex

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
kind of shed some light on the reflex
