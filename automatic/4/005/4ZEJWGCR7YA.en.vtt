00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:08.890
 ah 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.890
 [Music] 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.490
 ah 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.760
 Thank you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.520
 hello how are we all welcome 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.800
 back to the yola hobbies 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.320
 let's do another craft 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.320
 for that we're going to need in this 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.570
 occasion rolls of these paper 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.140
 sanitary 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.300
 we will also need white glue 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.530
 if you are going to use it to decorate 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.170
 The Christmas tree is a field 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.250
 scissors brush 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.159
 some accessories to decorate the flower 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.609
 what are we going to do and also what is the 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.870
 slim schedule for that let's grab 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.870
 one of the rolls 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 and we're going to cut them into strips 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 since we have our strips cut 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 let's grab one of them and we're going 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.220
 to cut in half and more or less 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 let's make another cut 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.870
 of a quarter or so of the measure 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.840
 total strips 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.490
 I was more or less of this size on 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.490
 tail center 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.010
 brush and we're going to paste it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.770
 we can help with tweezers and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.729
 put them aside 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.259
 then we will cut the other strips 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.259
 just in the middle 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.250
 in this way 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.240
 in the middle 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 and in the middle 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.020
 and we are going to make some little circles 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:21.030
 we need five for each little flower 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.569
 then we re -apply glue 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 and we close our circuit and we give 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.830
 our clamps and these are we going to do 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830
 5 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.720
 with the rest of the bandages that we 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.600
 they were like this and what we 're going to do 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.220
 now it's going to be 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.800
 Bend 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.920
 one of the corners as if we were 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.990
 make a circle and we'll leave it like that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.990
 from this we need 10 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.740
 and since we have all our pieces 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.470
 cut and they have already stuck well 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.290
 our little circle we go in a little bottle 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.370
 to put 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.370
 with the white 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.220
 and with the help of our brush 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.300
 Lets put 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.300
 the white tail around the whole 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300
 circle 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.500
 both inside and outside 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.019
 and we're going to give our frost maybe 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.540
 our little circle in this way and so 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.700
 we are going to do it with all the pieces 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.599
 we want 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.599
 chopped up 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.980
 good since we have all our 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.260
 pieces already pasted with the hoarfrost 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.090
 next step is going to be 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.090
 where the strips that we have 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.400
 let's give our silicone gun 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.000
 and we 're going to hit it this way 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.830
 and all these pieces 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 now with the big hoop let's go 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.160
 hitting 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.100
 the little hoops in this way 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.229
 and now finally it is to put silicone 

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.229
 here 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.240
 and paste them in the center 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.240
 good guys has already stuck like 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.790
 you can see the frost and all 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.790
 the parts that we put him are already 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.340
 stuck now the only thing is that if 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:41.240
 we would like to decorate a little more 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:44.960
 I have cut here a bit of foami 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.270
 a little circle they already sell it like this is this 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.080
 type of leaves are already frosted 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.300
 cut a little circle and it's just 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.220
 put silicon cold silicone in between 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.409
 the edges so I can put it here in 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.949
 the center and already final 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:07.679
 to finish decorating I will use this 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.219
 acrylic flower also with 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:10.219
 silicone 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.430
 here in the center 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.910
 and if you want to hang it in your first 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.840
