00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
myself so I figured this would be a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.350 
myself so I figured this would be a
decent<00:00:13.860> enough<00:00:13.920> game<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.429> certainly<00:00:15.210> thought

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
decent enough game I certainly thought

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.170 
decent enough game I certainly thought
it<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.570> pretty<00:00:15.719> cool<00:00:15.949> this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.490> another

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180

Templar build into high templar it's

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
Templar build into high templar it's
really<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:26.670> against<00:00:27.090> terrence<00:00:27.449> who<00:00:27.599> fast

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
really good against terrence who fast

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.269 
really good against terrence who fast
expand<00:00:29.269> it's<00:00:30.269> also<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:31.260> good<00:00:31.800> against

Terrans<00:00:32.640> who<00:00:32.820> go<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.930> marine<00:00:34.469> marauder

Terrans who go a lot of marine marauder
rushing<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.170> against<00:00:37.440> terran

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
rushing it's not so good against terran

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
rushing it's not so good against terran
to<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> banshee<00:00:38.460> marine<00:00:38.730> raven<00:00:39.059> build

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
to go the banshee marine raven build

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
to go the banshee marine raven build
obviously<00:00:39.719> cuz<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> raven<00:00:40.379> out

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
obviously cuz they have a raven out

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
obviously cuz they have a raven out
quickly<00:00:40.710> I've<00:00:41.340> still<00:00:41.670> beatin<00:00:41.969> those<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.540> it's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
quickly I've still beatin those but it's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
quickly I've still beatin those but it's
much<00:00:42.989> harder<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> kind<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
much harder because you have to kind of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.459 
much harder because you have to kind of
attack<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> base<00:00:45.539> while<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.899> push<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
attack the base while they push out and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.569 
attack the base while they push out and
be<00:00:46.649> sneaky<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.340> general<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be sneaky in general but I do like to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
be sneaky in general but I do like to
gas<00:00:50.910> steal<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.420> I'm<00:00:51.480> doing<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.719> build<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
gas steal what I'm doing this build the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gas steal serves the important purpose

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
gas steal serves the important purpose
of<00:00:54.719> stopping<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> temple<00:00:55.530> stopping<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> turn

stalker out well the stars that was
building<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> build<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> second<00:01:08.580> gas<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.030> can

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
building you build a second gas you can

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.679 
building you build a second gas you can
get<00:01:09.270> gas<00:01:09.479> quicker<00:01:10.220> but<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.970> gas<00:01:12.180> till<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> can

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
get gas quicker but the gas till you can

currently I see two Marines which
doesn't<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.049> tell<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:17.630> but

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
doesn't really tell you much but

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
doesn't really tell you much but
sometimes<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> marauder<00:01:20.100> come<00:01:20.340> out

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

sometimes you see a marauder come out
and<00:01:20.610> shoot<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.170> simulator<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.350> says

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and shoot at the simulator which says

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
and shoot at the simulator which says
tell<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> he's<00:01:22.950> probably<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
tell you he's probably not going for a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.100 
tell you he's probably not going for a
tech<00:01:24.240> build<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.360> back<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.659> I'll<00:01:27.780> build<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
tech build and back here I'll build a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100 
tech build and back here I'll build a
pylon<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> keep<00:01:28.920> watch<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:30.110> now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
pylon just to keep watch of that now

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
pylon just to keep watch of that now
this<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.650> isn't<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.369> rush<00:01:32.670> as

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this actually isn't so much of a rush as

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.810 
this actually isn't so much of a rush as
it<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
it is just a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
it is just a
transition<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:35.939> dark<00:01:36.180> templar<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
transition into dark templar it's not

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
transition into dark templar it's not
all<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.409> anything<00:01:37.470> stupid<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
all in or anything stupid like that and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.219 
all in or anything stupid like that and
with<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.210> simulator<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.750> i<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.899> see<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
with my simulator here i do see a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
with my simulator here i do see a
command<00:01:40.649> center<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.220> i<00:01:41.280> figure<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.790> safe<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
command center so i figure it's safe to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.820 
command center so i figure it's safe to
do<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.540> big<00:01:42.750> fast<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.200> bandy<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.649> dark

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
do it one big fast it's bandy into dark

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.980 
do it one big fast it's bandy into dark

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
templar sometimes you don't want to do

the one gate into dark templar you want

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.340 
the one gate into dark templar you want
to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> dark<00:01:48.360> templar<00:01:48.630> before<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> expand

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to do the dark templar before you expand

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
to do the dark templar before you expand
but<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.460> expands<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.030> pretty<00:01:51.270> safe<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
but when he expands it's pretty safe to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.779 
but when he expands it's pretty safe to
do<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.899> way<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> let's<00:01:53.310> push<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.729> a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
around try to hold these towers but oh

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.280 
around try to hold these towers but oh
well<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:18.100> there<00:03:18.640> come<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.880> Dark<00:03:19.090> Templar

Scouts go around check out what's going
on<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.920> think<00:03:24.280> he<00:03:24.400> saw<00:03:24.640> them<00:03:24.790> with<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:24.940> scan

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
on I do think he saw them with that scan

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.470 
on I do think he saw them with that scan
so<00:03:27.070> I'm<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.370> really<00:03:27.610> expecting<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.210> do<00:03:28.360> much

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
so I'm not really expecting to do much

so I'm not really expecting to do much
damage<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.990> more<00:03:29.260> expecting<00:03:29.709> them<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.830> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
damage and more expecting them to a

but<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.080> see<00:03:38.200> he<00:03:38.290> hasn't<00:03:38.470> really<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.770> much

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
but I can see he hasn't really have much

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.760 
but I can see he hasn't really have much
in<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.280> way<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.459> detection<00:03:40.380> he<00:03:41.380> does<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
in the way of detection he does have a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.310 
in the way of detection he does have a
command<00:03:42.040> center<00:03:42.070> down<00:03:42.340> here<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.610> scan<00:03:43.320> each

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
command center down here you scan each

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.440 
command center down here you scan each
scan<00:03:44.800> he<00:03:44.950> uses<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.400> about<00:03:45.700> equal<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.240> cost

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
scan he uses is about equal to the cost

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.690 
scan he uses is about equal to the cost
of<00:03:46.660> Dark<00:03:46.840> Templar<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.400> too<00:03:48.550> much<00:03:48.640> of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
of Dark Templar so it's not too much of

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.080 
of Dark Templar so it's not too much of
a<00:03:48.790> loss<00:03:48.940> by<00:03:49.120> force<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.450> scan<00:03:49.660> with<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> we'll

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
a loss by force to scan with it so we'll

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.300 
a loss by force to scan with it so we'll
try<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.270> see<00:03:52.390> how<00:03:52.450> many<00:03:52.510> scans<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.050> force

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
try to see how many scans we can force

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.170 
try to see how many scans we can force
your<00:03:54.310> starting<00:03:54.580> at<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> missile<00:03:54.820> turret

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
your starting at a missile turret

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.210 
your starting at a missile turret
there's<00:03:55.480> another<00:03:55.630> scan

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
there's another scan

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.920 
there's another scan
the<00:03:57.670> best<00:03:57.940> thing<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.240> can<00:03:58.330> do<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.570> get<00:03:58.720> away

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the best thing you can do is get away

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.540 
the best thing you can do is get away
after<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.230> skin<00:03:59.590> but<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.190> doesn't<00:04:00.460> usually

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
after a skin but it doesn't usually

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
happen that way now as you're doing that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.170 
happen that way now as you're doing that
you<00:04:04.570> want<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.750> tech<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.050> high<00:04:05.170> templar<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you want to tech the high templar and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.600 
you want to tech the high templar and
expanding<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.270> yourself<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:09.190> send<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.460> Dark

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
expanding in yourself they send the Dark

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.300 
expanding in yourself they send the Dark
Templar<00:04:09.730> in<00:04:10.030> one<00:04:10.390> at<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.570> time<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.310> probably

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
Templar in one at a time I probably

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.560 
Templar in one at a time I probably
should<00:04:12.490> realize<00:04:12.970> there's<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.210> turret<00:04:13.450> there

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
should realize there's a turret there

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.060 
should realize there's a turret there
and<00:04:13.660> this<00:04:13.750> isn't<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.080> work<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.560> do<00:04:14.890> run

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
and this isn't going to work so I do run

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.140 
and this isn't going to work so I do run
away<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.549> going<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.730> force<00:04:18.940> him<00:04:19.060> to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
away and this is going to force him to

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.970 
away and this is going to force him to
get<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.269> raven<00:04:19.630> before<00:04:19.900> he<00:04:19.959> pushes<00:04:20.230> out<00:04:20.380> he

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
get a raven before he pushes out he

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.650 
get a raven before he pushes out he
can't<00:04:21.280> even<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.790> about<00:04:21.910> attacking<00:04:22.060> until

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
can't even think about attacking until

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.960 
can't even think about attacking until
he<00:04:22.750> has<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.050> Raven<00:04:23.380> otherwise<00:04:23.860> he<00:04:24.130> will<00:04:24.280> just

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
he has that Raven otherwise he will just

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.550 
he has that Raven otherwise he will just
lose<00:04:25.150> half<00:04:25.390> his<00:04:25.420> army<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.990> Dark<00:04:26.170> Templar<00:04:26.290> as

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
lose half his army the Dark Templar as

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.440 
lose half his army the Dark Templar as
he<00:04:26.650> walks<00:04:26.830> over<00:04:26.980> I'll<00:04:27.640> keep<00:04:27.850> sending<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.240> one

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
he walks over I'll keep sending in one

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.090 
he walks over I'll keep sending in one
of<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.600> time<00:04:28.750> against<00:04:29.020> army<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.530> he'll<00:04:29.920> lose

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
of the time against army and he'll lose

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.470 
of the time against army and he'll lose

once he sees the expansion is probably

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.429 
it up but i do not know that so go back
to<00:05:25.590> here<00:05:26.300> at<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.509> point<00:05:27.719> in<00:05:27.839> the<00:05:27.900> game<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.259> have

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.709 
to here at this point in the game I have
a<00:05:28.469> decently<00:05:29.009> sized<00:05:29.310> army<00:05:29.699> i<00:05:29.819> have<00:05:30.120> Templar

with<00:05:30.900> psionic<00:05:31.050> storm<00:05:31.409> I'm<00:05:31.949> getting<00:05:32.189> the

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
with psionic storm I'm getting the

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.219 
with psionic storm I'm getting the
amulet<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.759> amulet<00:05:33.029> is<00:05:33.120> extremely<00:05:33.779> important

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
amulet the amulet is extremely important

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.570 
amulet the amulet is extremely important
because<00:05:34.289> it<00:05:34.710> gives<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.099> ability<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.339> warp

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
because it gives you the ability to warp

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.760 
because it gives you the ability to warp
in<00:05:35.699> Templar<00:05:36.319> so<00:05:37.319> you're<00:05:37.409> going<00:05:37.499> to<00:05:37.560> want<00:05:37.620> to

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
in Templar so you're going to want to

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.050 
in Templar so you're going to want to
rush<00:05:37.979> to<00:05:38.009> the<00:05:38.219> amulet<00:05:38.580> right<00:05:38.729> after<00:05:38.909> you<00:05:38.999> at

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
rush to the amulet right after you at

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.079 
rush to the amulet right after you at
the<00:05:39.120> High<00:05:39.240> Templar<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:40.639> what<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.669> like<00:05:41.849> to<00:05:41.939> do

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
the High Templar and what I like to do

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.059 
the High Templar and what I like to do
is<00:05:42.270> around<00:05:42.749> the<00:05:42.839> map<00:05:42.990> Borbon<00:05:43.349> pylons<00:05:43.770> along

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
is around the map Borbon pylons along

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.800 
is around the map Borbon pylons along
ledges<00:05:44.460> like<00:05:44.639> this<00:05:44.819> along<00:05:45.060> probable<00:05:45.599> routes

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
ledges like this along probable routes

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.320 
ledges like this along probable routes
to<00:05:45.990> my<00:05:46.080> base<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:47.669> he's<00:05:47.789> probably<00:05:47.879> to<00:05:48.120> come<00:05:48.210> to

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
to my base so he's probably to come to

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.429 
to my base so he's probably to come to
attack<00:05:48.539> me<00:05:48.689> this<00:05:48.839> way<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.050> if<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:49.199> hit<00:05:49.349> this

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
attack me this way so if you hit this

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.469 
attack me this way so if you hit this
expansion<00:05:49.800> what<00:05:50.610> I'll<00:05:50.699> do<00:05:50.879> is<00:05:50.999> I'll<00:05:51.089> put<00:05:51.330> some

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
expansion what I'll do is I'll put some

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.959 
expansion what I'll do is I'll put some
pylons<00:05:51.839> up<00:05:52.020> here<00:05:52.289> so<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.069> can<00:05:53.129> warp<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:53.550> Templar

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
pylons up here so I can warp in Templar

pylons up here so I can warp in Templar
things<00:05:54.270> on<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.539> ridge<00:05:54.719> to<00:05:54.900> intercept<00:05:55.229> them

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:55.879 
things on the ridge to intercept them

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.070 
things on the ridge to intercept them
you<00:05:56.879> know<00:05:56.969> I<00:05:56.999> do<00:05:57.120> see<00:05:57.360> he<00:05:57.479> has<00:05:57.599> an<00:05:57.749> expansion

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
you know I do see he has an expansion

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.389 
you know I do see he has an expansion
there's<00:05:58.529> not<00:05:58.650> really<00:05:58.770> much<00:05:58.979> I<00:05:59.129> can<00:05:59.159> do<00:05:59.370> about

00:05:59.389 --> 00:05:59.399 
there's not really much I can do about

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.829 
there's not really much I can do about
it<00:05:59.580> at<00:05:59.699> this<00:05:59.729> point<00:05:59.969> the<00:06:00.120> army<00:06:00.479> isn't<00:06:00.599> really

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839 
it at this point the army isn't really

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.350 
it at this point the army isn't really
big<00:06:00.960> take<00:06:01.379> on<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:01.589> planetary<00:06:01.919> fortress<00:06:02.370> plus

whatever army he would have there which

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.559 
whatever army he would have there which
is<00:06:04.620> probably<00:06:04.830> substantial<00:06:05.610> one<00:06:06.419> of<00:06:06.509> the

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
is probably substantial one of the

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.149 
is probably substantial one of the
benefits<00:06:06.899> of<00:06:06.990> doing<00:06:07.080> this<00:06:07.259> over<00:06:07.469> a<00:06:07.589> colossus

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159

benefits of doing this over a colossus
build<00:06:08.399> is<00:06:08.550> that<00:06:08.819> you<00:06:08.909> only<00:06:09.120> need<00:06:09.360> gateways<00:06:09.719> do

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
gateways you should be good and of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.519 
gateways you should be good and of
course<00:06:15.330> you<00:06:15.569> can<00:06:15.659> get<00:06:15.779> little<00:06:15.990> too<00:06:16.199> armors

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529

through<00:07:07.740> them<00:07:11.330> and<00:07:12.330> we'll<00:07:12.480> keep<00:07:12.630> going<00:07:12.810> +1

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
through them and we'll keep going +1

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.260 
through them and we'll keep going +1
armor<00:07:14.040> helps<00:07:14.490> a<00:07:14.610> lot<00:07:14.850> in<00:07:14.910> this<00:07:15.180> situation<00:07:17.270> but

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
armor helps a lot in this situation but

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.120 
armor helps a lot in this situation but
that<00:07:18.480> was<00:07:18.660> to<00:07:18.840> tear<00:07:18.990> into<00:07:19.080> primary<00:07:19.410> army<00:07:19.740> so<00:07:19.890> he

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
that was to tear into primary army so he

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.320 
that was to tear into primary army so he
probably<00:07:20.340> won't<00:07:20.580> have<00:07:20.670> much<00:07:20.880> left<00:07:21.090> at<00:07:21.240> his

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
probably won't have much left at his

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.550 
probably won't have much left at his
main<00:07:21.540> so<00:07:21.750> we'll<00:07:21.840> just<00:07:21.870> attack<00:07:22.230> is<00:07:22.380> natural<00:07:22.710> and

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
main so we'll just attack is natural and

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.830 
main so we'll just attack is natural and
again<00:07:25.560> he<00:07:25.680> has<00:07:25.800> more<00:07:25.980> ghosts<00:07:26.490> and<00:07:27.240> P<00:07:27.600> doesn't

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 
again he has more ghosts and P doesn't

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.750 
again he has more ghosts and P doesn't

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
ghost may get the chance and that is

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.500 
ghost may get the chance and that is
good<00:07:31.950> game<00:07:32.160> because<00:07:32.610> he<00:07:32.790> has<00:07:32.940> nothing<00:07:33.180> left<00:07:33.330> to

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
good game because he has nothing left to

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.150 
good game because he has nothing left to

that's<00:07:39.990> how<00:07:40.230> you<00:07:40.290> use<00:07:40.560> dark<00:07:40.860> templar<00:07:41.280> to

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
that's how you use dark templar to

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.010 
that's how you use dark templar to
contain<00:07:41.700> a<00:07:41.730> Terran<00:07:42.090> until<00:07:42.300> he<00:07:42.360> can<00:07:42.480> get<00:07:42.570> Ravens

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
contain a Terran until he can get Ravens

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.200 
contain a Terran until he can get Ravens
