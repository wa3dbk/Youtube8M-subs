part<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.680> reason<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.100> think<00:02:58.400> he's<00:02:58.520> so

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
part of the reason I think he's so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.310 
part of the reason I think he's so
successful<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.570> I've<00:02:59.810> talked<00:03:00.020> about<00:03:00.230> this

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
successful and I've talked about this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.250 
successful and I've talked about this
before<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.770> because<00:03:00.800> he<00:03:01.250> knows<00:03:01.610> exactly<00:03:02.450> in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
before is because he knows exactly in

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.850 
before is because he knows exactly in
true<00:03:04.030> satirist<00:03:05.030> fashion<00:03:05.900> he<00:03:06.380> knows<00:03:06.620> how<00:03:06.830> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
true satirist fashion he knows how to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.880 
true satirist fashion he knows how to
cross<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.520> line<00:03:07.910> between<00:03:08.720> comedian<00:03:09.590> and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
cross that line between comedian and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.160 
cross that line between comedian and
citizen<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.760> he<00:03:10.850> does<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.330> gracefully<00:03:11.630> so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
citizen and he does it gracefully so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.860 
citizen and he does it gracefully so
that<00:03:12.320> he's<00:03:12.440> really<00:03:13.010> kind<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.090> rallying<00:03:14.630> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
that he's really kind of rallying the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.050 
that he's really kind of rallying the
base<00:03:15.080> while<00:03:15.410> still<00:03:15.770> being<00:03:15.800> funny<00:03:16.459> that's

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
base while still being funny that's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060 
base while still being funny that's
something<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.570> Jon<00:03:17.930> Stewart<00:03:17.959> does<00:03:18.680> and

dry<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.650> was<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:41.460> more<00:04:41.640> esoteric

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
dry it was a little more esoteric

to<00:04:45.120> be<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.270> little<00:04:45.510> bit<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:45.840> have<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.050> know

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
to be a little bit you have to know

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.540 
to be a little bit you have to know
what's<00:04:46.320> going<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.830> world<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.160> i<00:04:47.280> like

what's going on in the world and i like
that<00:04:47.580> but<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.690> was<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> little<00:04:49.020> more<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.010> I

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
that but it was a little more so and I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.430 
that but it was a little more so and I
thought<00:04:50.760> honestly<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.750> know<00:04:51.840> from<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.110> comic

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.140 
thought honestly you know from a comic
perspective<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.190> just<00:04:53.340> wasn't<00:04:53.670> as<00:04:53.790> funny

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
perspective to it just wasn't as funny

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.920 
perspective to it just wasn't as funny
as<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:55.410> lot<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.740> his<00:04:56.040> usual<00:04:56.760> stuff<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.600> when<00:04:57.780> he

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
as a lot of his usual stuff so when he

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.690 
as a lot of his usual stuff so when he
does<00:04:58.170> this<00:04:58.820> kind<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.680> these<00:05:01.680> pieces<00:05:02.040> where<00:05:02.490> he

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
does this kind of these pieces where he

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.210 
does this kind of these pieces where he
really<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.210> crossing<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:03.960> line<00:05:04.020> we<00:05:04.920> really

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
really is crossing that line we really

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.800 
really is crossing that line we really
isn't<00:05:05.490> giving<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.060> commentary<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:06.660> you

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
isn't giving the commentary that you

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.300 
isn't giving the commentary that you
know<00:05:06.930> what<00:05:07.080> these<00:05:07.290> consolidation<00:05:07.950> laws<00:05:08.130> are

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.890 
know what these consolidation laws are
here<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.670> reason<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:09.210> it's<00:05:09.420> because<00:05:09.780> we

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
here for a reason and it's because we

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.330 
here for a reason and it's because we
don't<00:05:10.050> want<00:05:10.260> people<00:05:10.440> like<00:05:10.680> Rupert<00:05:11.010> Murdoch
