00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello youtube friends, well, well, 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.170
 It's great to present the latest version 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.770
 of android and the ivam a very good rom 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.610
 I would say that of the best based on a 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.910
 miletone coffee blend 10 g 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.910
 10 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.599
 paranoid android good to the best 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.810
 some of you sound this to Chinese all 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.829
 these terms but it 's a bit of everything 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.960
 except stock voucher ie it is based on 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.540
 all important and good versions 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.550
 that we have that are not official 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.989
 samsung is worth then it's as if a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 bomb would have compiled everything 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.280
 good of those of those systems 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 well here we have that typical of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.860
 cyanogenmod and aoca p ie the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.920
 aesthetics is certainly very similar 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 although it comes with the s 3 launcher 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.809
 official samsung we have also like 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.320
 option the tribute that is the one that comes 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.050
 by default with roms ao cape and with 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 last no longer being too 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.270
 but I already say that it also comes with the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.650
 original or the samsung officer that is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 this the launcher the launcher 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 that is, this is the official samsung 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.440
 well let's go to the heart of this rom that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.440
 it really is very good if we go to 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.320
 information we see that the version of the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.770
 of the rom is that of ivam 3.0 there what 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.050
 we have 300 the water version that is the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.220
 milestone 1 the cyanogenmod version 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.220
 it would be 10 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 and in fact if we click on the version of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.420
 cyanogenmod there we have it 10 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.939
 OK 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.340
 if we click on auca p version 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.409
 milestone 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.409
 we have that is the rock p 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.690
 there is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.560
 and if we go to android version by 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.730
 Of course we always get 412 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.130
 philippine we have 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.220
 well as I said it was a mixture of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.560
 all of all a little the menus are kind 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.900
 tablet as you see it does not become equal 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.940
 just like a tablet but they are with a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.650
 text smaller than really in the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.900
 big screen that we have in the s3 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.390
 Well, you can take advantage of it. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.720
 in vibration mode I will activate it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 sound 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.930
 the volume can be extended ie 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.849
 that all volumes do not come out and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.330
 let's go to the really good thing about this rom 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.510
 which is the control rom we have the auc 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.930
 apes settings that would be to tune 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.900
 absolutely everything of the terminal changes 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.549
 visual lock screen options 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.030
 shutdown options that as you can see 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.920
 endless options 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.690
 in the navigation bar if we want 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 have it or not as we want to have it with 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.209
 what buttons in terms of visual changes 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.940
 it has a lot 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.319
 the batteries the battery bar the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.640
 clock centered on one side etc 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.069
 all this here also what I have 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.639
 said battery the clock the wifi signal 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.639
 from 3g 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 the gestures the buttons the sound 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.390
 good time sound what I said 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.100
 what to activate the volume panel for 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 that when we give it here we get that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.870
 that is already in the official also the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.970
 time if we want it when it goes out 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.610
 the terminal shows us the time if 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.870
 we want to assign physical actions to 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.480
 buttons when we have the terminal 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.630
 off good many options 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.180
 true then the paranoid options that 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.110
 would be to work in tablet mode the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.310
 interface the apps and so on a great rom 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.570
 paranoid android 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.269
 Well, this one has built-in 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.220
 same options there we have the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.600
 cyanogenmod options here the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.400
 we have also 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.050
 we are not going to see them all because really 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.050
 would be to be here half an hour 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.980
 watching all the lock screen 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.980
 and the others 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.550
 the wallpapers 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.180
 proper to ivam 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.599
 and well the rest would be the same as 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.430
 any other rom or cape oceans in 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.380
 motorcycle or even that stock because 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.500
 The rest of the menu is already a menu 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.590
 android typical good very good rom good 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 very versatile performance because you already 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.419
 I say it is compatible with the kernel that 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.210
 comes standard that we said on a motorcycle or 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.620
 the kernel chair that I know of even 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.360
 there may be more carnal than 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.280
 also compatible but well yo os 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.139
 I quote these two as proof and in addition 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.819
 I repeat that it can be installed as rom 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.190
 secondary and that I encourage you to 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.500
 install you have no excuse is a very 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.210
 good rom and posts to choose with a rom 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.819
 secondary the truth that this is very 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.190
 good rom is a good option to roms 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.020
 stock that we have right now 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.090
 friends then here I leave this rom os 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.729
 I also leave the link so you can 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.470
 download read all especially not 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.349
 leave nothing without reading that it's good to read it 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.340
 and as I always say hello to everyone and 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.340
