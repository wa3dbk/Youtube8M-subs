disappointed in this theory not because

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.400

it's<00:00:23.660> not<00:00:24.460> probable<00:00:25.460> or<00:00:25.760> not<00:00:26.540> because<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.230> don't

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's not probable or not because I don't

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.460 
it's not probable or not because I don't
believe<00:00:28.250> in<00:00:28.430> it<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:28.730> because<00:00:29.570> it's<00:00:29.780> just<00:00:30.080> so

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
believe in it but because it's just so

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.979 
believe in it but because it's just so
short<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.970> really<00:00:32.360> don't<00:00:32.509> have<00:00:32.599> much<00:00:32.780> to

talk<00:00:33.140> about<00:00:33.200> today<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:33.950> theory<00:00:34.309> is<00:00:34.520> that

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
talk about today the theory is that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.299

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
concepts for advertising you can kind of

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.170 
concepts for advertising you can kind of
come<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.930> conclusion<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.790> fact<00:03:03.060> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
come to the conclusion to the fact that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390 
come to the conclusion to the fact that
these<00:03:03.780> at<00:03:04.019> least<00:03:04.230> take<00:03:04.500> place<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.159> same

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
these at least take place in the same

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520 
these at least take place in the same
universe<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> not<00:03:06.629> only<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.049> cities<00:03:07.349> look

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
universe so not only do the cities look

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.500 
universe so not only do the cities look
similar<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.579> same<00:03:08.790> brands<00:03:09.359> and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
billboards that exist in each other the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.149 
billboards that exist in each other the
animation<00:03:12.720> style<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> show<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.680> general

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
animation style of the show in general

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.759 
animation style of the show in general
is<00:03:14.340> very<00:03:14.760> very<00:03:15.150> similar<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.720> Powerpuff<00:03:16.440> Girls

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
is very very similar to Powerpuff Girls

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.379 
is very very similar to Powerpuff Girls
now<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.099> may<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.370> thinking<00:03:17.579> hey<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.209> is

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
now you may be thinking hey this is

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.119 
now you may be thinking hey this is
created<00:03:18.780> by<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> same<00:03:19.170> guy<00:03:19.409> or<00:03:19.709> has<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.950> same

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.220 
created by the same guy or has the same
animators<00:03:20.760> or<00:03:20.879> same<00:03:21.030> illustrators<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.840> these

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
animators or same illustrators if these

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.259 
animators or same illustrators if these
animators<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:22.980> illustrators<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.639> talented

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
animators and illustrators are talented

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.000 
animators and illustrators are talented
which<00:03:24.510> they<00:03:24.720> obviously<00:03:25.319> would<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.859> they're

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
which they obviously would be if they're

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.550 
which they obviously would be if they're
working<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.639> some<00:03:27.180> company<00:03:27.510> heirs<00:03:28.079> network

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
working for some company heirs network

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.650 
working for some company heirs network
like<00:03:28.799> Cartoon<00:03:29.400> Network<00:03:29.849> they<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.359> probably

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
like Cartoon Network they can probably

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.680 
like Cartoon Network they can probably
come<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> different<00:03:32.760> style<00:03:33.239> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
come up with a different style of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.629 
come up with a different style of
animation<00:03:33.989> if<00:03:34.650> they<00:03:34.799> really<00:03:34.980> wanted<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
animation if they really wanted to

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.869 
animation if they really wanted to
because<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.419> that<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:37.079> conclude<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
because of that we can conclude that the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.360 
because of that we can conclude that the
Powerpuff<00:03:39.449> Girls<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.989> Samurai<00:03:40.410> Jack<00:03:40.530> takes

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack takes

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.520 
Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack takes
place<00:03:41.699> in<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> same<00:03:42.389> universe<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:43.349> that's

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
place in the same universe so that's

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.349 
place in the same universe so that's
basically<00:03:43.949> the<00:03:44.069> theory<00:03:44.579> I'm<00:03:44.760> sorry<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.180> guys

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
basically the theory I'm sorry you guys

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.270 
basically the theory I'm sorry you guys
are<00:03:45.389> disappointed<00:03:46.169> in<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.379> length<00:03:46.650> or<00:03:47.010> if<00:03:47.160> you

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
are disappointed in the length or if you

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.860 
are disappointed in the length or if you
thought<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:48.180> baby<00:03:48.359> there<00:03:48.569> was<00:03:48.690> some

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
thought that the baby there was some

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.530 
thought that the baby there was some
background<00:03:49.410> story<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:49.980> there<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:51.090> mean

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
background story in there and I mean

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.599 
background story in there and I mean
there<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.109> there<00:03:52.260> isn't<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:53.069> can<00:03:53.250> kind<00:03:53.519> of

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
there is but there isn't you can kind of

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.490 
there is but there isn't you can kind of
compare<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.090> two<00:03:54.359> shows<00:03:54.629> and<00:03:54.959> see<00:03:55.139> how<00:03:55.290> some

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
compare the two shows and see how some

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.050 
compare the two shows and see how some
of<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> things<00:03:55.889> are<00:03:56.010> similar<00:03:56.280> some<00:03:56.879> of<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
of the things are similar some of the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.210 
of the things are similar some of the
fight<00:03:57.299> scenes<00:03:57.660> are<00:03:57.840> similar<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.739> way<00:03:58.889> that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
fight scenes are similar the way that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.729 
fight scenes are similar the way that
the<00:03:59.340> characters<00:03:59.879> move<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.720> their<00:04:01.230> animation

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
the characters move and their animation

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.770 
the characters move and their animation
style<00:04:01.980> as<00:04:02.159> I've<00:04:02.340> said<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.669> very<00:04:02.699> similar<00:04:03.209> but

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
style as I've said is very similar but

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.500 
style as I've said is very similar but
other<00:04:04.409> than<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.250> mean<00:04:05.819> they're<00:04:06.180> really

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
other than that I mean they're really

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.640 
other than that I mean they're really
you<00:04:06.569> can't<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:06.930> make<00:04:07.109> too<00:04:07.319> many

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
you can't really make too many

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.670 
you can't really make too many
connections<00:04:08.069> between<00:04:08.489> Samurai<00:04:09.299> Jack<00:04:09.680> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
connections between Samurai Jack and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.920 
connections between Samurai Jack and
Powerpuff<00:04:11.159> girls<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.940> storyline<00:04:12.419> sense

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
Powerpuff girls in a storyline sense

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.409 
Powerpuff girls in a storyline sense
because<00:04:13.349> their<00:04:13.680> stories<00:04:14.069> take<00:04:14.370> place

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
because their stories take place

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.849 
because their stories take place
thousands<00:04:15.419> of<00:04:15.479> years<00:04:15.690> apart<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.349> yeah<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.709> I

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
thousands of years apart but yeah like I

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.439 
thousands of years apart but yeah like I
said<00:04:17.039> I<00:04:17.070> hope<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.370> guys<00:04:17.549> enjoyed<00:04:17.909> the<00:04:18.060> theory

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
said I hope you guys enjoyed the theory

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.659 
said I hope you guys enjoyed the theory
I<00:04:18.720> really<00:04:19.139> like<00:04:19.349> this<00:04:19.530> one<00:04:19.799> despite<00:04:20.430> having

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
I really like this one despite having

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.960 
I really like this one despite having
never<00:04:21.150> seen<00:04:21.269> Samurai<00:04:22.019> Jack<00:04:22.130> actually<00:04:23.130> ever<00:04:23.490> I

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
never seen Samurai Jack actually ever I

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.520 
never seen Samurai Jack actually ever I
did<00:04:24.300> really<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:24.719> this<00:04:24.900> theory<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.229> think<00:04:25.320> it's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
did really like this theory I think it's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.409 
did really like this theory I think it's
a<00:04:25.590> really<00:04:25.800> interesting<00:04:26.010> idea<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.849> think<00:04:27.330> it

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
a really interesting idea I think it

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.850 
a really interesting idea I think it
holds<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.080> lot

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
holds a lot

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.580 
holds a lot
water<00:04:29.099> if<00:04:29.639> that's<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.569> same<00:04:30.810> if<00:04:31.199> that's<00:04:31.409> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
water if that's the same if that's the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.510 
water if that's the same if that's the
right<00:04:31.680> saying<00:04:31.889> if<00:04:32.039> that's<00:04:32.129> the<00:04:32.340> wrong<00:04:32.460> I'm

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
right saying if that's the wrong I'm

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.339 
right saying if that's the wrong I'm
saying<00:04:32.759> tell<00:04:32.969> me<00:04:33.060> what<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.419> because<00:04:33.629> I<00:04:33.960> say

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
saying tell me what it is because I say

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.080 
saying tell me what it is because I say
it<00:04:34.469> like<00:04:34.650> every<00:04:34.979> video<00:04:35.129> and<00:04:35.430> always<00:04:35.639> edit<00:04:35.849> it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
it like every video and always edit it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.540 
it like every video and always edit it
out<00:04:36.210> because<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.719> don't<00:04:36.810> really<00:04:37.500> know<00:04:37.830> what<00:04:38.430> it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550
