you<00:00:28.109> saw<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:29.100> above<00:00:29.430> in<00:00:29.640> rough<00:00:29.820> water<00:00:30.150> under

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
you saw from above in rough water under

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.960 
you saw from above in rough water under
water<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> looks<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.800> even<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.790> rough

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
water it looks like this even in rough

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.090 
water it looks like this even in rough
water<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:34.200> turbulence<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
water because this the turbulence is all

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889 
water because this the turbulence is all
on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.309> surface<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:35.940> long<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.540> these

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
on the surface so as long as I do these

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.640 
on the surface so as long as I do these
things<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.130> see<00:00:38.340> me<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.670> here

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.760 
the moment the hand goes in the fingers
are<00:02:05.880> down<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.300> palm<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.690> back<00:02:06.870> because<00:02:07.380> as

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
are down in the palm is back because as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.620 
are down in the palm is back because as
long<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.250> palm<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.610> back<00:02:08.790> if<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.090> apply<00:02:09.360> any

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
long as the palm is back if I apply any

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.840 
long as the palm is back if I apply any
pressure<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.649> resultant<00:02:11.100> force<00:02:11.160> moves<00:02:11.700> me

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
pressure the resultant force moves me

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.360 
pressure the resultant force moves me
forward<00:02:12.140> all<00:02:13.140> right<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.920> look<00:02:14.130> at<00:02:14.220> other

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
forward all right if you look at other

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.460 
forward all right if you look at other
people<00:02:14.459> there's<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.110> tremendous<00:02:16.110> amount<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
people there's a tremendous amount of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.259 
people there's a tremendous amount of
time<00:02:16.680> when<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> hand<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.519> back<00:02:17.790> where

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
time when the hand is going back where

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.759 
time when the hand is going back where
the<00:02:18.360> palm<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.750> facing<00:02:18.900> somewhere<00:02:19.530> other<00:02:19.680> than

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
the palm is facing somewhere other than

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.430 
the palm is facing somewhere other than
back<00:02:20.100> alright<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:22.260> that's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
back alright so what we have here that's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.009 
back alright so what we have here that's
me<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> blue<00:02:23.100> suit<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.550> blue<00:02:23.700> cap

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
me in the blue suit in the blue cap

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.770 
me in the blue suit in the blue cap
alright<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.820> seen

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
alright so what we have here is seen

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.560 
alright so what we have here is seen
taken<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.290> San<00:02:28.470> Francisco<00:02:28.980> Bay<00:02:29.299> during<00:02:30.299> the

championships and basically you can look
at<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> head<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.620> stays<00:02:37.620> low<00:02:37.980> watch<00:02:38.370> everybody

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
at the head it stays low watch everybody

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.250 
at the head it stays low watch everybody
else<00:02:38.970> look<00:02:39.299> at<00:02:39.420> their<00:02:39.600> heads<00:02:39.780> what<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.200> do

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
else look at their heads what they do

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.009 
else look at their heads what they do
picking<00:02:40.799> up<00:02:40.950> their<00:02:41.880> heads<00:02:42.150> swinging<00:02:42.870> their

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
picking up their heads swinging their

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.410 
picking up their heads swinging their
heads<00:02:43.230> around<00:02:43.760> alright<00:02:44.760> look<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.269> their

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
heads around alright look at their

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.330 
heads around alright look at their
recoveries<00:02:46.140> how<00:02:46.410> their<00:02:46.620> arms<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
recoveries how their arms go in the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.360 
recoveries how their arms go in the
water<00:02:47.720> alright<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.080> basically<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.010> stroke

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
water alright and basically the stroke

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.660 
water alright and basically the stroke
you<00:02:50.610> saw<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.480> photo<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:53.100> slide<00:02:53.430> I'm

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
you saw in that photo in that slide I'm

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.960 
you saw in that photo in that slide I'm
replicating<00:02:54.200> stroke<00:02:55.200> after<00:02:55.470> stroke<00:02:55.980> after

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
replicating stroke after stroke after

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.090 
replicating stroke after stroke after
stroke<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.450> rough<00:02:57.660> water<00:02:57.990> because<00:02:58.530> I've<00:02:58.830> honed

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
stroke in rough water because I've honed

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.600 
stroke in rough water because I've honed
the<00:02:59.730> circuits<00:03:00.240> for<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.310> I

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the circuits for it and you know I I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.250 
the circuits for it and you know I I
know<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.120> gonna<00:03:03.240> face<00:03:03.540> stuff<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.080> this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
know that I'm gonna face stuff like this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.080 
know that I'm gonna face stuff like this
and<00:03:04.500> I'm<00:03:04.590> building<00:03:04.800> resistance<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
and I'm building resistance to the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.280 
and I'm building resistance to the
things<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.510> give<00:03:07.200> everybody<00:03:07.680> else

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
things that give everybody else

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:30.450 
things that give everybody else
