00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.240 
I'm gonna get ready to cook some bacon

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.190 
I'm gonna get ready to cook some bacon
then<00:00:03.240> I'm<00:00:03.360> gonna<00:00:03.480> preload<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:05.750> firebox<00:00:06.750> but

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
then I'm gonna preload the firebox but

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.549 
then I'm gonna preload the firebox but
I'm<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:09.440> what<00:00:10.440> I've

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
I'm going to kind of show you what I've

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.110 
I'm going to kind of show you what I've
learned<00:00:10.830> about<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:12.920> last<00:00:13.920> night<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.190> pretty

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
learned about that last night I pretty

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.890 
learned about that last night I pretty
loaded<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.630> little<00:00:16.020> bit<00:00:16.170> too<00:00:16.379> deep<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
loaded a little bit too deep and and I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
loaded a little bit too deep and and I
think<00:00:22.109> it'll<00:00:22.260> look<00:00:22.470> better<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:23.910> loaded

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
think it'll look better if I just loaded

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.670 
think it'll look better if I just loaded
it<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.369> little<00:00:26.369> shallower<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.470> there's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it a little shallower so that there's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.410 
it a little shallower so that there's
room<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.699> flame<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> develop<00:00:32.180> before<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
room for the flame to develop before it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.260 
room for the flame to develop before it
hits<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> bottom<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> pan<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> I've<00:00:35.880> kind

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
hits the bottom of the pan so I've kind

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.810 
hits the bottom of the pan so I've kind
of<00:00:36.360> divided<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.110> sticks<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.680> smaller<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
of divided my sticks into smaller and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
of divided my sticks into smaller and
larger<00:00:39.170> sizes<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.730> I'm<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.940> gonna<00:00:42.410> I'm<00:00:43.410> just

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
larger sizes and I'm just gonna I'm just

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
larger sizes and I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna<00:00:43.710> load<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.090> pack

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
gonna load them in here you really pack

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
gonna load them in here you really pack
it<00:00:45.930> pretty<00:00:46.469> tight<00:00:46.829> I'll<00:00:47.309> show<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.850> high<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it pretty tight I'll show you how high I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.049 
it pretty tight I'll show you how high I
think<00:00:48.390> probably<00:00:48.930> makes<00:00:49.320> sense<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.870> preload<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
think probably makes sense to preload it

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
think probably makes sense to preload it
you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.180> put<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.809> however<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.440> can

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you can put them in just however you can

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.630 
you can put them in just however you can
fit<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.760> most<00:00:56.969> sticks<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.920> tightest

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fit the most sticks in to this tightest

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.810 
fit the most sticks in to this tightest
amount<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.149> space<00:01:01.219> it's<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.670> I'm

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
amount of space it's kind of what I'm

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.620 
amount of space it's kind of what I'm
gonna<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> fire<00:01:09.330> will

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
gonna go with this time the fire will

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
gonna go with this time the fire will
work<00:01:09.810> its<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
work its way through and I think that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
work its way through and I think that
this<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> depends<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> type<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.869> wood

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
this kind of depends on the type of wood

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.859 
this kind of depends on the type of wood
you're<00:01:13.290> using<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> being<00:01:14.310> these

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
you're using but this being these

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.910 
you're using but this being these
cottonwoods<00:01:16.009> just<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.460> burns<00:01:18.350> easy<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
cottonwoods just really burns easy and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
cottonwoods just really burns easy and
burns<00:01:20.220> fast<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> hard<00:01:22.290> wood<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
burns fast it's not at all a hard wood I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.749 
burns fast it's not at all a hard wood I
don't<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:28.159> then<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.520> these

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
don't think so then I'm gonna use these

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
don't think so then I'm gonna use these
little<00:01:30.000> Shorter's<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> smaller<00:01:31.320> sticks

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
little Shorter's or the smaller sticks

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.160 
little Shorter's or the smaller sticks
to<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> fill<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> fill<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.810> gaps

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to kind of fill the fill the little gaps

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
to kind of fill the fill the little gaps
that<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.590> left<00:01:34.890> behind<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:38.960> what<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.079> gonna

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that are left behind here what I'm gonna

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.580 
that are left behind here what I'm gonna
do<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.650> leave<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.189> an<00:01:41.369> inch<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
do is leave about an inch so from the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.450 
do is leave about an inch so from the
wood<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.610> lower<00:01:45.000> level<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.229> leave<00:01:46.649> an

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
wood to this lower level and leave an

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
wood to this lower level and leave an
inch<00:01:48.049> nona<00:01:49.049> maybe<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.590> less<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.040> an

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
inch nona maybe a little less than an

00:01:50.189 --> 00:02:00.380 
inch nona maybe a little less than an
inch<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:59.250> far<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> packed<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
inch so that it as far as packed this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
inch so that it as far as packed this
packed<00:02:00.750> wood<00:02:01.170> goes<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.759> I'll<00:02:03.000> put<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
packed wood goes and then I'll put a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
packed wood goes and then I'll put a
little<00:02:03.450> fluffy<00:02:03.960> stuff<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.439> top<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.009> help<00:02:05.180> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
little fluffy stuff on top to help just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670 
little fluffy stuff on top to help just
get<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> started<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.049> it'll<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> little

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
get it started and it'll be a little

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.860 
get it started and it'll be a little
higher<00:02:07.979> than<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.240 

okay<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:12.930> I'll<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.379> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> show<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.920> down

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
okay so I'll just kind of show you down

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.399 
okay so I'll just kind of show you down
in<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:14.640> what<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.000> looks<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:19.290> kind

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
in there what that looks like it's kind

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.990 
in there what that looks like it's kind
of<00:02:19.530> packed<00:02:19.799> in<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.159> tight<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:20.879> I'll

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
of packed in there tight and then I'll

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
of packed in there tight and then I'll
just<00:02:21.209> build<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.659> little<00:02:21.689> fire<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.140> top<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.769> this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
just build a little fire on top of this

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.080 
just build a little fire on top of this
and<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.659> way<00:02:24.810> it'll<00:02:25.250> last<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:26.879> whole

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
and in that way it'll last for my whole

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:40.149 
and in that way it'll last for my whole
cooking<00:02:27.750> project<00:02:28.909> time<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.030> Shady<00:02:30.299> your<00:02:30.510> spot

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:53.599 

so<00:02:51.620> then<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:53.099> little<00:02:53.280> flame

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
so then it's just a little flame

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.110 
so then it's just a little flame
underneath<00:02:54.090> there<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.400> it'll<00:02:56.400> build<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.909> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
underneath there and it'll build of that
