00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
way as you can see over and towards

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.670 
way as you can see over and towards
fishing<00:01:08.830> or<00:01:08.950> I<00:01:09.040> believe<00:01:10.110> another<00:01:11.110> spot<00:01:11.500> here

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
fishing or I believe another spot here

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.520 
fishing or I believe another spot here
as<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.070> can<00:01:12.100> see<00:01:12.190> here<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:14.140> way<00:01:14.260> if<00:01:14.410> you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
as you can see here and the way if you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.990 
as you can see here and the way if you
walk<00:01:14.770> into<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.310> can<00:01:15.430> actually<00:01:15.670> start<00:01:15.910> to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
walk into it you can actually start to

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940 
walk into it you can actually start to
stand<00:01:16.300> up<00:01:16.450> again<00:01:16.720> they<00:01:17.140> actually<00:01:17.500> notice<00:01:17.770> that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
stand up again they actually notice that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.310 
stand up again they actually notice that
your<00:01:18.070> swim<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.610> there<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:18.970> if<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.900> stay

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
your swim in there and if you stay

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.930 
your swim in there and if you stay
underwater<00:01:20.560> for<00:01:20.890> too<00:01:21.010> long<00:01:21.190> you'll<00:01:21.700> start

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
underwater for too long you'll start

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.730 
underwater for too long you'll start
getting<00:01:21.970> hit<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.450> that's<00:01:23.050> effectively<00:01:23.470> you

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
getting hit and that's effectively you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
getting hit and that's effectively you
suffocate<00:01:24.430> or<00:01:24.720> drowning<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.220> don't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
suffocate or drowning and if you don't

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.780 
suffocate or drowning and if you don't
get<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.210> air<00:01:28.920> quickly<00:01:29.920> then<00:01:30.340> you'll<00:01:30.640> actually

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
get to air quickly then you'll actually

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.290 
get to air quickly then you'll actually
die<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:32.140> that's<00:01:32.260> not<00:01:32.530> very<00:01:32.680> good<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.300> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
die and that's not very good is it and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300 
die and that's not very good is it and
so<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.290> can<00:01:35.350> see<00:01:35.530> here<00:01:35.770> once<00:01:36.130> you're<00:01:36.280> on

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
so as you can see here once you're on

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.540 
so as you can see here once you're on
the<00:01:36.550> fishing<00:01:36.880> hook<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:38.110> can<00:01:38.410> stand<00:01:39.190> just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
the fishing hook you can stand just

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.370 
the fishing hook you can stand just
above<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.850> door<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.450> zombies<00:01:41.110> will<00:01:41.230> gather

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
above the door and zombies will gather

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
door x to the frog is actually open

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.830 
door x to the frog is actually open
now<00:01:48.520> if<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.880> have<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.030> friend<00:01:49.299> up<00:01:49.450> on<00:01:49.659> top
