00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
head off and quickly that's why I would

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.940 
head off and quickly that's why I would
recommend<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.840> was<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> extreme

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
recommend like was it extreme

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030 
recommend like was it extreme
conditioning<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.439> lightweight<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
conditioning and lightweight it's a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.899 
conditioning and lightweight it's a
light<00:01:32.189> way<00:01:32.310> i'm<00:01:32.460> pretty<00:01:32.700> sure<00:01:32.790> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
light way i'm pretty sure it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
light way i'm pretty sure it's
lightweight<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.350> around<00:01:34.470> shooting

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
lightweight and just go around shooting

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.800 
lightweight and just go around shooting
the<00:01:34.920> head<00:01:35.040> off<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:35.790> tried<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> for
