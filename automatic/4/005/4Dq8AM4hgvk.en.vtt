whole thing I was on you when I watched

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
whole thing I was on you when I watched
the<00:01:04.170> news<00:01:04.290> last<00:01:04.559> night<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> saw<00:01:05.869> Carrodus

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the news last night and I saw Carrodus

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.460 
the news last night and I saw Carrodus
and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.330> red<00:01:09.780> jersey<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.380> all

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and I was in the only red jersey and all

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
and I was in the only red jersey and all
the<00:01:10.590> visor<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> green<00:01:11.280> jersey<00:01:11.700> run<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> stage

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the visor and green jersey run a stage

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
the visor and green jersey run a stage
and<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:13.049> why<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.260> play<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> sport<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.130> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and that's why you play a sport but we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.469 
and that's why you play a sport but we
need<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.549> back<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.939> stage<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
need to get back to that stage and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.560 
need to get back to that stage and
that's<00:01:16.189> why<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.340> frustrated<00:01:17.610> our<00:01:18.180> challenge

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that's why I'm frustrated our challenge

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
that's why I'm frustrated our challenge
that<00:01:18.720> monster<00:01:19.080> diminutive<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.670> doesn't

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that monster diminutive that doesn't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
that monster diminutive that doesn't
seem<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:22.369> within<00:01:23.369> arm's<00:01:24.299> length<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.960> we

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
seem to be within arm's length so we

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
seem to be within arm's length so we
have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> work<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> those

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have a bit of work to do to get to those

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
have a bit of work to do to get to those
stages<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.500> that's<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> us<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
stages and that's for all of us to to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
stages and that's for all of us to to
get<00:01:30.060> behind<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> try<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.380> back

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
get behind and and try and get back

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.380 
get behind and and try and get back
there<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.310> concern<00:01:32.700> me

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.300 

the<00:01:38.390> avid<00:01:38.689> that's<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.079> Jeff<00:01:39.409> harvesters

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the avid that's for Jeff harvesters

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.130 
the avid that's for Jeff harvesters
probably<00:01:40.670> thought<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:40.909> for<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.899> Scottish

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
probably thought that for the Scottish

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.929 
probably thought that for the Scottish
game<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:42.469> was<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.770> better<00:01:42.920> option<00:01:43.009> but<00:01:43.789> that

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
game I was the better option but that

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.249 
game I was the better option but that
would<00:01:44.090> change<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.600> summer<00:01:44.810> claim<00:01:45.079> that

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
would change in the summer claim that

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.559 
would change in the summer claim that
the<00:01:45.710> nobodies<00:01:46.250> need<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.850> be<00:01:46.939> promoted<00:01:47.479> and

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
the nobodies need to be promoted and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.359 
the nobodies need to be promoted and
that's<00:01:47.780> exactly<00:01:48.289> what<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.159> have<00:01:49.219> backed

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
that's exactly what I would have backed

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.639 
that's exactly what I would have backed
as<00:01:49.609> well<00:01:49.789> but<00:01:49.969> for<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.659> crucial<00:01:51.049> away<00:01:51.259> again<00:01:51.500> we

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
as well but for a crucial away again we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.039 
as well but for a crucial away again we
thought<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.299> would<00:01:53.299> have<00:01:53.390> done<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> job<00:01:53.780> within

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
thought I would have done the job within

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.010 
thought I would have done the job within
Scotland<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.679> then<00:01:55.030> at<00:01:56.030> least<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.329> can<00:01:56.569> walk

to be honest which is also like that's

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.599 
to be honest which is also like that's
exactly<00:03:13.489> where<00:03:13.669> I<00:03:13.730> am<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:15.549> there's<00:03:16.549> a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.949 
time and I think it's it's it's it's
stuff<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.139> that<00:03:27.319> raised<00:03:27.680> me<00:03:27.950> because
