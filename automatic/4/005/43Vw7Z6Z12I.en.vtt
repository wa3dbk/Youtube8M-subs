00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
pioneer and this these are actually

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.820 
pioneer and this these are actually
packaged<00:00:21.570> differently<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.650> it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
packaged differently as you can see it's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.500 
packaged differently as you can see it's
a<00:00:22.920> thin<00:00:23.280> and<00:00:23.520> wide<00:00:24.330> box<00:00:24.630> instead<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.830> hdj

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
a thin and wide box instead of the hdj

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.089 
a thin and wide box instead of the hdj
2000s<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:28.440> are<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.220> kind<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.119> wide<00:00:30.480> and

2000s which are a kind of wide and
thinner<00:00:32.099> box<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.699> it's<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:33.120> difference<00:00:33.780> there

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
thinner box so it's a difference there

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810
