bulky I mean they do come with this
traveling<00:01:35.270> it's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> case<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
traveling it's not really a case like a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.060 
traveling it's not really a case like a
sack<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.360> mean<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> nice<00:01:40.680> mesh

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
sack so I mean this is a nice mesh

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
sack so I mean this is a nice mesh
material<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:42.420> doesn't<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.689> protect<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
material it doesn't really protect the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
material it doesn't really protect the
headphones<00:01:43.850> from<00:01:44.850> breaking<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> drop

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
headphones from breaking if you drop

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
headphones from breaking if you drop
them<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.250> protect<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> from

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
them but they do protect it from

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.340 
them but they do protect it from
scratches<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> nice<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
scratches and it's just a nice thing to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.149 
scratches and it's just a nice thing to
have<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.250> overall<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.689> great<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
have so overall these are great for the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.880 
have so overall these are great for the
price<00:01:53.189> you're<00:01:53.520> getting<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:54.860> I've<00:01:55.860> used
