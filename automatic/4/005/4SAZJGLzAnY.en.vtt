how going to induce some pictures is a
good<00:00:26.490> idea<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> practice<00:00:27.420> your<00:00:27.539> pitch

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
good idea is to practice your pitch

control<00:00:28.820> quite<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.090> smooth<00:00:30.330> day<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
do is you come down in the brakes

do is you come down in the brakes
release<00:00:34.710> let<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.699> do<00:00:35.820> its<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.090> dive

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
release let it do its little dive

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.470

thing to do and then if you release you
get<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:42.930> big<00:00:43.110> picked<00:00:43.350> forward<00:00:46.699> where<00:00:47.699> they

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
get a big picked forward where they

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.829 
get a big picked forward where they
correct<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.540> Texas<00:00:49.019> forward<00:00:50.690> that's<00:00:51.690> all

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
correct it as a Texas forward that's all

another<00:01:19.820> just<00:01:20.820> flying<00:01:21.090> along<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.770> hit

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
another just flying along here if we hit

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
another just flying along here if we hit
some<00:01:23.100> lift<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.880> pull<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.149> brakes<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
some lift and you pull the brakes on and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
some lift and you pull the brakes on and
then<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> release<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.490> pitch

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
then you release it you get this pitch

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.569 
then you release it you get this pitch
forward<00:01:27.409> move<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> wrong<00:01:28.650> timing<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.369> pull

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
forward move the wrong timing you pull

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
forward move the wrong timing you pull
the<00:01:29.670> brakes<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> worse<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the brakes now you make it worse you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130 
the brakes now you make it worse you
release<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> worse<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
release it now we make it worse it's a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.550 
release it now we make it worse it's a
cool<00:01:34.790> way<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> solve<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> pictures<00:01:37.170> back

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
cool way to solve it pictures back

the glider ah does r53 turbulence quick
reactions<00:02:35.510> will<00:02:35.989> stop<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> glider<00:02:36.620> ending<00:02:37.010> up

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
reactions will stop the glider ending up

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.890 
reactions will stop the glider ending up
in<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.310> pendulum<00:02:38.049> if<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.260> react<00:02:39.980> too<00:02:40.160> late<00:02:40.900> what

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
in a pendulum if you react too late what

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.960 
in a pendulum if you react too late what
happens<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:43.040> you're<00:02:43.250> swinging<00:02:43.519> now<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.849> go

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
happens is as you're swinging now you go

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.490 
happens is as you're swinging now you go
this<00:02:44.299> is<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.540> high<00:02:44.660> side<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.110> lean<00:02:45.260> over<00:02:45.380> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
this is the high side you lean over that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.770 
this is the high side you lean over that
side<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.730> got<00:02:46.880> all<00:02:47.030> my<00:02:47.450> left-hand

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
side and then you got all my left-hand

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.300 
side and then you got all my left-hand
sides<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.380> sudden<00:02:48.739> you're<00:02:48.829> lean<00:02:48.950> unto<00:02:49.069> their

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
sides of a sudden you're lean unto their

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.250 
sides of a sudden you're lean unto their
side<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.810> you're<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.079> get<00:02:51.170> this

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
side and you're going to get this

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350 
side and you're going to get this
oscillation<00:02:51.920> all<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.519> time<00:02:52.730> can<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> react

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
oscillation all the time can you react

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.559 
oscillation all the time can you react
you<00:02:53.390> too<00:02:53.690> slowly<00:02:54.130> okay<00:02:55.130> now<00:02:55.790> counteract<00:02:56.390> this

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
you too slowly okay now counteract this

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.080 
you too slowly okay now counteract this
you<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.810> go<00:02:56.989> quickly<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.220> soon<00:02:58.549> as<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.819> side

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
you just go quickly so soon as the side

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.160 
you just go quickly so soon as the side
lift<00:02:59.450> my<00:03:00.440> left<00:03:00.620> side<00:03:00.860> lifts<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.340> lean<00:03:01.610> left

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
lift my left side lifts a lean left

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
the glide is pitched behind me my toes

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.110 
the glide is pitched behind me my toes
are<00:03:22.010> pointing<00:03:22.310> at<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.489> horizon<00:03:22.579> if<00:03:22.970> it's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
are pointing at the horizon if it's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.490 
are pointing at the horizon if it's
pitching<00:03:23.420> in<00:03:23.480> front<00:03:23.569> of<00:03:23.750> me<00:03:23.870> my<00:03:24.109> toes<00:03:24.319> are

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
pitching in front of me my toes are

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.099 
pitching in front of me my toes are
pointing<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> ground<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.900> pretty

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
pointing at the ground it's pretty

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.930 
pointing at the ground it's pretty
simple<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.040> your<00:03:28.190> tires<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.519> pointing<00:03:28.819> up

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
simple so if your tires are pointing up

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.990 
simple so if your tires are pointing up
without<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.420> behind<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.639> then<00:03:31.639> tires<00:03:31.849> are

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
without it behind you then tires are

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.089 
without it behind you then tires are
pointing<00:03:32.269> up<00:03:32.359> your<00:03:32.900> hand<00:03:33.079> should<00:03:33.290> be<00:03:33.319> up<00:03:33.440> and

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
pointing up your hand should be up and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.770 
pointing up your hand should be up and
as<00:03:34.250> soon<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.430> they<00:03:34.639> start<00:03:35.150> sinking<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.660> the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
as soon as they start sinking on the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
as soon as they start sinking on the
horizon<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:37.280> brakes<00:03:37.519> should<00:03:37.670> come<00:03:37.849> down

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.390
