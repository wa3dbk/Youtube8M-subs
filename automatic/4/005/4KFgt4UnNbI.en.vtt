00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.060
 you know I do not recommend this video 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.670
 OK we start 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.829
 ok the first thing we're going to do is go to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.769
 look for the application true the app store 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.739
 although later we look for home 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.899
 most outstanding highlights after no more 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 down we make sure that there is no 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.329
 in an account set here 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.879
 we have one we put him we touch him and 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.479
 we can disconnect account to be able 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:11.039
 create an account ok since we have a 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.149
 account we look for a free account like 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.880
 let's use a free one that does not 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.600
 let's have installed gesta 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 ok since we have it we lower it the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.399
 we try to go down and that's what the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.409
 option to start section use from there 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.399
 each depositor that we are going to create 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.399

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.330
 hand then I would recommend that you 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.550

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.830
