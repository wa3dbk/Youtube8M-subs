considered to be normal for death metal
with<00:02:36.760> death<00:02:37.300> metal<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.780> kind<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> very

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
with death metal it's kind of a very

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.260 
with death metal it's kind of a very
basic<00:02:38.620> style<00:02:39.130> unless<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:39.970> into<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
basic style unless you get into the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.150 
basic style unless you get into the
really<00:02:40.390> technical<00:02:40.690> variety<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:42.010> is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
really technical variety and this is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.100 
really technical variety and this is
where<00:02:42.370> Deus<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.760> kind<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.090> post<00:02:43.480> borders<00:02:43.959> on

one of the best I've heard their

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
one of the best I've heard their
discography<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.769> years<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.150> a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
discography in years and this is a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.090 
discography in years and this is a
really<00:03:43.450> positive<00:03:43.630> thing<00:03:43.959> there's<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.590> lot<00:03:44.920> of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100

probably<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> most<00:03:47.650> important<00:03:48.130> thing<00:03:48.310> is

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
probably the most important thing is

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.710 
probably the most important thing is
that<00:03:48.519> this<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:48.970> not<00:03:49.150> an<00:03:49.269> album<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.600> gets

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720
