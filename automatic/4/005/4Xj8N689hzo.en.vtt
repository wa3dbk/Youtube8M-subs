00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello everyone today for women 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 let's make one of the evergreens of make-up 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.660
 and that is the smoky eyes is a trick that not 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 it will never go out of style we see it everywhere 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 we see it at gala evenings on the red 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 you can do a carpet evening trick 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.359
 do many colors and today we will do it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.580
 the classic one the most daring maybe 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 like me they also use it quietly 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.399
 by day and I tell you it's easier than 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.399
 what it seems 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 we can start as a fat base 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 black we make the classic version 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.220
 for today then maybe I tell you how to play 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.160
 how can you make it more colorful? 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.940
 tonight if I go out for dinner and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.940
 lifted up 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.199
 so warm with your fingers 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.509
 of fingers will help me to fade into 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.869
 produced with a gradient brush 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.840
 I take an opaque gray eyeshadow then 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.930
 same shimmer third nothing 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.090
 I always beat the excess and began to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.390
 apply it over the fatty base 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 no 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.180
 with a gradient brush a little more 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.860
 wide of what than before 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.430
 I go a little in the fold with a color 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 opaque brown not too dark this there 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 helps a little with light touches and me 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.860
 I recommend it helps us a little bit to create 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 that smoothie effect we give up 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.240
 blend a little 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.240
 macheda and above 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.229
 at the fireplace fading into this movement 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.070
 forward back forward and backward 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.070
 we begin to fail 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.040
 the secret, however, of the last church 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.240
 even if it doesn't have to be completely 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.870
 a precision trick is still that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.870
 to fade 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:36.950
 to create an effect a little more grade 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.349
 I don't use the brown that I used before 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.170
 along with the slightly lighter brown and 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.170
 begins to go higher 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.330
 always with a gradient brush but 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.800
 a little bit smaller takes a 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.750
 brown, always opaque, however, for shooting and lo 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.750
 I put here in a fold 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.670
 I'm good with the first brush 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.670
 the colors together 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.780
 if you wish you could leave it like this then 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.140
 but with a nice dark gray I apply 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.140
 black on the eyelid above the gray 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.129
 I take the black pencil and milk 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:50.550
 inside the eyes always rhyme 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.349
 lower and higher because you don't have to 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.030
 just seeing not even a minimum of 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.030
 skin must be all dark 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.420
 since we have the pencil in hand 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.280
 We outline we also obscure the part that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 at the hairline to make 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.080
 all very dark with a small brush 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.230
 small we apply some of the brown 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.739
 dark mixed with black 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.739
 let's go right here where there is the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.739
 pencil 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.300
 the choice is yours with an eye shadow 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.780
 use it opaque and only clear or a little 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.400
 put some shimmer here 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.510
 at the inner corner a hair below for 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.780
 give this light point that opens a 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.780
 a little look from your eyelashes 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.480
 I apply a nice volumizing mascara if 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.990
 you want you can add eyelashes 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.990
 finished 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.710
 but to keep them well folded I use my fingers 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.480
 I keep all the rest of my face a lot on 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 natural neutral then I apply a 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.550
 blush on natural tones slightly 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:39.040
 rosato then a kind of brown 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.040
 rosy and opaque 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:49.830
 you can to make the effect even more 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.690
 as it is said more markedly apply a 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.820
 corrector just to destroy 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.140
 completely the lips and put some 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.360
 of transparent gloss 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.760
 I really don't like it I can't find it 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.230
 fine be very well so I apply a 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.230
 gloss then closes on the brown 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.910
 as I told you they can be used 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.550
 many colors this here with black the 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.610
 brown just the most classic is that 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.030
 classic but you can also do purple 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.069
 the important thing is to have this effect 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.020
 gradual then maybe a dark purple 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:31.599
 that slowly becomes a pink or with a 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.550
 dark blue that gradually becomes a 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.560
 light blue or dark blue 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.360
 floor becomes green you can 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.759
 quietly experiment playing 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.380
 quietly with colors and now me 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.419
 I have to run because my boyfriend is there 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.310
 that I'm waiting for we take dinner 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.310
 so see you next time bye
