00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.170 

this<00:01:20.100> diagram<00:01:20.960> represents<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.170> human

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
this diagram represents a human

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
this diagram represents a human
chromosome

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.819 

this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.670> length<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.979> DNA<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> human

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this is a length of DNA so the human

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.149 
this is a length of DNA so the human
chromosome<00:01:35.399> is<00:01:35.759> made<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> DNA<00:01:37.070> for<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
chromosome is made of DNA for the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.700 
chromosome is made of DNA for the
purposes<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.939> discussion<00:01:39.710> we'll

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
purposes of this discussion we'll

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
purposes of this discussion we'll
identify<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.460> gene<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.210> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
identify a gene which is here and this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
identify a gene which is here and this
gene<00:01:46.460> codes<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:49.409> protein<00:01:50.270> insulin<00:01:52.100> which

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
gene codes for the protein insulin which

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.319 
gene codes for the protein insulin which
as<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.490> may<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.780> hormone<00:01:56.329> controlling

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
as you may know is a hormone controlling

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:06.420 
as you may know is a hormone controlling
blood<00:01:57.840> sugar<00:01:58.170> levels

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.020 

the<00:02:06.880> restriction<00:02:07.840> enzyme<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.740> selected<00:02:09.490> that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the restriction enzyme is selected that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.440 
the restriction enzyme is selected that
can<00:02:10.300> cut<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:12.210> DNA<00:02:13.950> here<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:16.920> here

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
can cut the DNA here and here

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.420 
can cut the DNA here and here
essentially<00:02:19.450> we're<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.080> cut<00:02:20.320> out<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
essentially we're going to cut out the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.460 
essentially we're going to cut out the
gene<00:02:22.240> for<00:02:23.230> insulin<00:02:24.480> these<00:02:25.480> enzymes<00:02:26.170> are

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
gene for insulin these enzymes are

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.110 
gene for insulin these enzymes are
called

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
called

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.710 
called
restriction<00:02:29.340> enzymes<00:02:33.060> which<00:02:34.060> were<00:02:34.270> covered

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
restriction enzymes which were covered

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:46.309 
restriction enzymes which were covered
in<00:02:35.490> Section<00:02:36.540> 512

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.910 

having<00:02:47.159> cut<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.610> gene<00:02:48.140> then<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.739> would

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
having cut the gene then we would

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.030 
having cut the gene then we would
progress<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.849> stage<00:02:51.180> here<00:02:51.599> where<00:02:52.590> we

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
progress to this stage here where we

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.330 
progress to this stage here where we
will<00:02:53.250> take<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.209> plasmid

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.009 

and<00:02:59.430> we<00:03:00.300> will<00:03:00.510> cut<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.840> with<00:03:01.739> exactly<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.610> same

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
and we will cut it with exactly the same

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:15.000 
and we will cut it with exactly the same
restriction<00:03:04.019> enzyme

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.309 

so<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> restriction<00:03:16.120> enzyme<00:03:16.360> used<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.110> cut

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
so the restriction enzyme used to cut

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.399 
so the restriction enzyme used to cut
out<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.830> human<00:03:18.220> gene<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.750> also<00:03:19.750> used<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.110> cut

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
out the human gene is also used to cut

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:26.210 
out the human gene is also used to cut
the<00:03:20.590> plasmid<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.830> leaves<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.400> plasmid

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the plasmid this leaves the plasmid

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.220 
the plasmid this leaves the plasmid
looking<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.700> this

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.210 

so<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.340> ring<00:03:35.849> structure<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.660> broken<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
so that the ring structure is broken the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.130 
so that the ring structure is broken the
next<00:03:41.519> stage<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> introduce<00:03:43.170> into<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.580> cut

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
next stage is to introduce into the cut

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.729 
next stage is to introduce into the cut
plasmids<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:47.459> human<00:03:47.849> insulin<00:03:48.599> gene<00:03:49.080> like

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
plasmids the human insulin gene like

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.949 
plasmids the human insulin gene like
this

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
this

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.080 
this
remembering<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.500> plasmid<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.489> composed

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
remembering that the plasmid is composed

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.790 
remembering that the plasmid is composed
of<00:03:54.360> DNA<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:56.700> human<00:03:57.120> gene<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.660> composed<00:03:58.560> of

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
of DNA and the human gene is composed of

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.990 
of DNA and the human gene is composed of
DNA<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:02.370> next<00:04:02.760> step<00:04:03.000> we'll<00:04:03.750> leave<00:04:04.110> our

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
DNA the next step we'll leave our

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.990 
DNA the next step we'll leave our
plasmid

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.810 

with<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.320> human<00:04:11.770> gene<00:04:12.780> inserted<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:15.190> here

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.970 

it's<00:04:18.820> learned<00:04:19.180> necessary<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.350> complete<00:04:20.799> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
it's learned necessary to complete the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.080 
it's learned necessary to complete the
process<00:04:21.240> by<00:04:22.240> applying<00:04:22.480> a<00:04:23.880> second<00:04:24.880> enzyme

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
process by applying a second enzyme

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.950 
process by applying a second enzyme
which<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.020> called<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.620> D<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:28.440> ligase<00:04:29.640> enzyme

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
which is called a D and a ligase enzyme

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
which is called a D and a ligase enzyme
which<00:04:31.960> will<00:04:32.290> join<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:34.330> DNA<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:38.530> combination

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
which will join the DNA this combination

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.940 
which will join the DNA this combination
