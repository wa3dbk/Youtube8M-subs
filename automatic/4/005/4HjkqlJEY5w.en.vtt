how the notes are going to be played by
the<00:01:03.740> arpeggiator<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.760> go<00:01:04.880> ahead<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.089> set<00:01:05.210> this

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
the arpeggiator we go ahead and set this

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.550 
the arpeggiator we go ahead and set this
on<00:01:05.510> up<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:08.180> can<00:01:08.330> also<00:01:08.480> change<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.110> note<00:01:09.320> rate

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
on up you can also change the note rate

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.160 
on up you can also change the note rate
which<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:09.980> how<00:01:10.100> fast<00:01:10.400> or<00:01:11.210> slow<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.900> notes<00:01:12.080> are

gonna<00:01:12.290> be<00:01:12.380> played<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:14.030> can<00:01:14.060> there's<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.810> number

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
gonna be played you can there's a number

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.980 
gonna be played you can there's a number
of<00:01:15.200> different<00:01:15.560> settings<00:01:16.040> here<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.700> going<00:01:17.690> to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
of different settings here I'm going to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.540 
of different settings here I'm going to
go<00:01:18.290> ahead<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.500> set<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:18.770> on<00:01:18.979> eighth<00:01:19.220> notes

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
go ahead and set this on eighth notes

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.690 
go ahead and set this on eighth notes
and<00:01:20.410> then<00:01:21.410> finally<00:01:22.010> there's<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.340> octave

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
and then finally there's the octave

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.109 
and then finally there's the octave
range<00:01:22.900> which<00:01:23.900> sets<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.560> limitation<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.640> how

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
range which sets the limitation of how

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.140 
range which sets the limitation of how
high<00:01:26.600> or<00:01:27.440> how<00:01:27.500> low<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.130> notes<00:01:28.790> are<00:01:28.940> gonna<00:01:29.000> be

high or how low the notes are gonna be

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.780 
high or how low the notes are gonna be
played<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:30.680> can<00:01:30.710> set<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.220> within<00:01:31.550> one<00:01:31.760> octave

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
played you can set it within one octave

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.700 
played you can set it within one octave
two<00:01:32.330> octaves<00:01:32.750> three<00:01:33.080> octaves<00:01:33.440> or<00:01:33.530> four

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
two octaves three octaves or four

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.680 
two octaves three octaves or four
octaves<00:01:34.160> let<00:01:35.090> me<00:01:35.150> go<00:01:35.210> ahead<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.450> leave<00:01:35.540> this

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
octaves let me go ahead and leave this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.770 
octaves let me go ahead and leave this
on<00:01:35.869> two<00:01:36.259> octaves<00:01:38.080> go<00:01:39.080> ahead<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.320> tap<00:01:39.500> Done<00:01:39.800> and
