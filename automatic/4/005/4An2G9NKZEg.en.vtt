Reddington drift simple design what I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.010 
Reddington drift simple design what I
like<00:01:09.909> about<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.450> there's<00:01:10.810> not<00:01:10.990> a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
like about it is there's not a

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.779 
like about it is there's not a
complicated<00:01:11.439> drag<00:01:11.859> system<00:01:12.250> there's<00:01:12.520> just<00:01:12.700> a

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
complicated drag system there's just a

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.849 
complicated drag system there's just a
small<00:01:13.119> amount<00:01:13.329> of<00:01:13.450> tension<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:14.469> lose<00:01:14.649> them

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
small amount of tension to lose them

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.919 
small amount of tension to lose them
then<00:01:14.979> loosen<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.399> drag<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.479> makes<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.840> very

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
then loosen the drag and it makes a very

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.870 
then loosen the drag and it makes a very
very<00:01:17.409> good<00:01:17.560> noise<00:01:17.770> when<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.189> pull<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.460> out<00:01:18.549> and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
very good noise when you pull it out and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.999 
very good noise when you pull it out and
provides<00:01:19.179> just<00:01:19.570> enough<00:01:19.840> resistance<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.619> that

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
provides just enough resistance and that

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.669 
provides just enough resistance and that
noise<00:01:21.219> although<00:01:21.880> then<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.689> as<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.109> joke<00:01:23.439> that

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
noise although then that as a joke that

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.709 
noise although then that as a joke that
may<00:01:23.829> sound<00:01:24.039> like<00:01:24.219> fun<00:01:24.579> but<00:01:24.759> what<00:01:25.179> that<00:01:25.329> does<00:01:25.539> is

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
may sound like fun but what that does is

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.179 
may sound like fun but what that does is
it<00:01:25.869> tells<00:01:26.049> you<00:01:26.289> when<00:01:26.469> you're<00:01:26.619> pulling<00:01:26.829> on<00:01:27.039> the

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
it tells you when you're pulling on the

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.440 
it tells you when you're pulling on the
line<00:01:27.340> when<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:27.609> want<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.850> be<00:01:27.969> pulling<00:01:28.179> on<00:01:28.359> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
line when you want to be pulling on the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.270 
line when you want to be pulling on the
separate<00:01:28.780> line<00:01:28.929> more<00:01:29.469> about<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.890> later<00:01:29.950> as

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
separate line more about that later as

thing we have is a tapered leader and as

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.029 
thing we have is a tapered leader and as
I<00:02:07.569> mentioned<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.229> can<00:02:08.289> attach<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
I mentioned you can attach it with a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.040 
I mentioned you can attach it with a
loop-de-loop<00:02:09.399> connection<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> kit

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
loop-de-loop connection so this kit

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.960 
loop-de-loop connection so this kit
includes<00:02:11.200> two<00:02:11.470> tapered<00:02:11.980> leaders<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.460> loop

includes two tapered leaders a loop

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.340 
includes two tapered leaders a loop
right<00:02:13.150> there<00:02:13.210> it's<00:02:13.510> going<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.750> attach<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
right there it's going to attach to the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.470 
right there it's going to attach to the
other<00:02:14.380> loop<00:02:14.740> very<00:02:15.430> simple<00:02:15.850> way<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:15.970> connect<00:02:16.330> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
other loop very simple way to connect it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.830 
other loop very simple way to connect it
now<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
now it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.600 
now it
