00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.320
 x is a special roller coaster because it has four lanes 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.509
 2 kings who can live very well foot of the roller coasters 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.979
 and also another role play that rotates the seats 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.400
 these rebels alter distance between train rails and themselves 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.380
 and when the distance is also triggered a great angel that makes the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.650
 100 seats forward or backward 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.810
 it's not that the car is coupling rather web page until it reaches a 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.920
 concrete position during the circuit that appetitive was attended 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.970
 unique feature and if it gave me exit laughter investigates 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.250
 instead of a 360 degree rite this open investment of 270 degrees makes 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 that passengers enjoy to achieve 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 This flying machine weighs almost 23 thousand kilos 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 is the largest that has ever been built 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.540
 women reach a speed of about 122 kilometers per hour and four as 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.050
 5g exhibition 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.890
 because with similar characteristics to the txikis his team had to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.600
 build some pillars bonds for this attraction 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.570
 the cement columns are sunk 26 meters below the ground so that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.200
 could support the steel structure of 1 with 22 million kilos of 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.050
 anfo style 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.690
 the technology that was used in x was developed by chiquitita routine the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.800
 famous roller coaster company 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.230
 they introduced innovations like the first roller coaster of 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 Steel with tubular shape in wood Jorge Mendes in the state 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.460
 a designer as follows can clearly visualize how it will be 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.280
 an attraction 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.910
 but sometimes it is not so easy to explain to others an attraction 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.280
 like before 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.890
 we made a first design of this roller coaster now about eight years 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.360
 but never got past the first test on the rod laver is because the first time 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.750
 when those who had seen it tried to describe themselves the law the only thing 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.539
 that occurs to them to say Marian's age 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.689
 I think that in an idea too revolutionary for the majority of 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.169
 people understood as being 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.169
 everything changed with the technical doubts of animation that are used nowadays 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.699
 thanks to them, to teach everyone how this attraction is even before 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:21.849
 that the law is built 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.099
 when people can see the image in real time how they really are already 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.400
 able to understand what we have in mind we must understand that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.689
 there is a roller coaster prototype 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.129
 that means it's the first time a roller coaster has been built like this 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.709
 thanks to computer analysis, many things can be determined but not 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 all 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.619
 that's so if your team had to build a smaller version 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.069
 of his future and amazing roller coaster 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 well in the facilities of aglutinar sendic 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.430
 for almost two years the cars were tested and perfected the tracks and 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.949
 the gears to turn this roller coaster into one of the best 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.999
 attractions of our time 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.809
 but for a special attraction as a state even after having 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:12.119
 adjusted the last nut the work has only begun plastic 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.099
 When you have finished placing the last section you could start up 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.099
 the train for the first time to one is ready to open it to the public 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.429
 still many retouching must be done 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.809
 the train has to travel the circuit many times to adjust the 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.999
 ikea brakes on 32 must pay the control system should work well for 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.909
 to be able to direct the trains and be able to carry out these operations from the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.909
 station and as in any other attraction of the harness system 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.159
 Safety comfort and resistance are the key elements of good design 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.559
 of harnesses 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.659
 one of the best kept secrets in the park industry 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.129
 attractions is how safe it is that roller coasters are actually 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.469
 everyone has fun imagining that there are dangers nx 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.469
 The key to good security is the harness system 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.939
 and in x 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.290
 even the safety system of harnesses is something that had never been 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.619
 seen before 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.919
 It is different from the others 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.309
 has a butterfly-shaped vertical adjustment that also moves towards 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:08.159
 up and down 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.209
 I'm going to ride and that's how to teach you how it works when you get on a 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.109
 roller coaster 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.279
 the first thing he will do if he is to lower the harness and is that it is very revolutionary 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.709
 when you want the seat fits on both the shoulders and chest and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.830
 for the smallest people fit the thighs 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.960
 you have a safety belt that closes so then you're ready 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 to go to the station and to start the circuit two years 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 20 million dollars and today is the day of the inauguration 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:39.120
 brian cowen has long been waiting for his life of christ and those of his life 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.729
 sure it moves by 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:42.570
 if you do 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.570
 He has been waiting for months explaining what was going to come true 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:51.710
 you can see the whole park from here 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.710
 go beyond 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.249
 on the first day of middle and high class 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.360
 they were evacuated to the other vehicles that has been getting to first 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 now we are going forward to enter into force 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.650
 - the real zaragoza 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.159
 let's start second b 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.159
 the person in charge of the entity 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.849
 back work 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.719
 not only that but before his house 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.650
 is incredible
