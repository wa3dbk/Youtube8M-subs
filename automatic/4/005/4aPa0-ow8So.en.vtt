this<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.600> going<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> hardest<00:02:12.170> part

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
this is going to be the hardest part

you're going to need it for at least 15
minutes<00:02:16.010> until<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.550> ball<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.330> dough<00:02:17.510> becomes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
minutes until this ball of dough becomes

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.520 
minutes until this ball of dough becomes
quite<00:02:18.320> smooth<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.430> elastic<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.450> once<00:02:21.410> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
quite smooth and elastic and once it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.260 
quite smooth and elastic and once it
becomes<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.250> state<00:02:22.700> what<00:02:23.030> you're<00:02:23.150> going

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
becomes at that state what you're going

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
to do is you're going to set it aside

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.410 
to do is you're going to set it aside
for<00:02:24.410> about<00:02:24.860> 15<00:02:25.250> minutes<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.670> let<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> glutens

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
for about 15 minutes to let the glutens

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.900 
for about 15 minutes to let the glutens
relax<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.830> will<00:02:27.980> make<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.130> easier<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.700> roll

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
relax this will make it easier to roll

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.520 
relax this will make it easier to roll
out<00:02:29.150> later<00:02:31.570> okay<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.780> don't<00:02:32.900> need<00:02:33.020> no<00:02:33.140> fancy

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
out later okay we don't need no fancy

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.550 
out later okay we don't need no fancy
machine<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:35.180> grab<00:02:35.450> your<00:02:35.660> rolling<00:02:36.080> pin<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
flatten it slightly and we're gonna roll

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.230 
flatten it slightly and we're gonna roll
it<00:02:46.850> out<00:02:47.000> turn<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.050> roll<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.620> out<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.970> what

you're<00:02:50.390> looking<00:02:50.750> for<00:02:51.020> when<00:02:51.170> you're<00:02:51.350> rolling

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're looking for when you're rolling

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.260 
you're looking for when you're rolling
it<00:02:51.770> out<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.460> get<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.700> paper-thin

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
it out is you want to get it paper-thin

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.300 
it out is you want to get it paper-thin
you<00:02:53.900> want<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.040> can

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
you want to get it so that you can

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.760 
you want to get it so that you can
actually<00:02:55.670> see<00:02:56.060> through<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.620> reason

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
actually see through it and the reason

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.500 
actually see through it and the reason
for<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:58.340> as<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> rule<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.390> thumb

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
for that is because as a rule of thumb

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.960 
for that is because as a rule of thumb
as<00:03:00.080> we're<00:03:00.320> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.800> be<00:03:00.950> cooking<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.790> is

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
as we're going to be cooking it this is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.240 
as we're going to be cooking it this is
going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.240> double<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.780> thickness<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:04.070> make

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
going to double in thickness so make

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.080 
going to double in thickness so make
sure<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.490> you<00:03:04.820> do<00:03:05.030> roll<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.720> thin

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
sure that you do roll it really thin

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.580 
sure that you do roll it really thin
okay<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.180> now<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.840> sheets<00:03:09.140> are<00:03:09.320> ready

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
okay so now that your sheets are ready

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.530 
okay so now that your sheets are ready
all<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.460> do<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.790> dust<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.240> little<00:03:11.270> bit

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
all you have to do is dust a little bit

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.330 
all you have to do is dust a little bit
of<00:03:11.630> flour<00:03:11.870> again<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.710> so<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:13.070> they<00:03:13.220> don't

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
of flour again just so that they don't

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.070 
of flour again just so that they don't
stick<00:03:13.820> because<00:03:14.150> what<00:03:14.480> we're<00:03:14.600> gonna<00:03:14.690> do<00:03:14.959> is

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
stick because what we're gonna do is

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.740 
stick because what we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:15.200> gonna<00:03:15.320> fold<00:03:15.770> them<00:03:16.010> over<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.750> we're

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
we're gonna fold them over and we're

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.449 
we're gonna fold them over and we're
gonna<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.080> because<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.770> just<00:03:18.920> makes<00:03:19.190> them

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
gonna do that because it just makes them

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.360 
gonna do that because it just makes them
easier<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> cut<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.360> noodles<00:03:20.770> so<00:03:21.770> what<00:03:22.280> I'm

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
easier to cut the noodles so what I'm

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.040 
easier to cut the noodles so what I'm
doing<00:03:22.670> here<00:03:22.880> as<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.150> see<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:23.630> I'm<00:03:23.810> just

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
doing here as you can see as I'm just

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.500 
doing here as you can see as I'm just
folding<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.530> over<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.209> then<00:03:26.209> I'm<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.330> gonna

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
folding it over and then I'm just gonna
