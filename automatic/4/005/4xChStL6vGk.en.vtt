 Let's take care of girls once they dial 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:13.710
 [Music] 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.540
 investments the available travel to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.610
 share a coffee rate because 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.529
 ignores a very interesting topic because 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.570
 I have a new video here in the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.039
 coffee break and means we're going to talk 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 of something related to literature 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.510
 How is the video project in one of them? 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 a subject that worries me personally 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.269
 Enough fifa bad literature come on 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.519
 talking about reading the novel, let's not talk 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.290
 of unconditional love and ended 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.059
 first there are women on the rock 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.260
 represents for me that would be the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.239
 love at first sight 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.930
 Justin is turning up late in this movie 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 lose spectacular tube record collects 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 they all lost their face in the race 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 and ending up with people who will take over 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.410
 with lumpiness on pages 1 formed 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.870
 hunt communion morrostock face to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.270
 sawmill and joinery spread 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.460
 knowledge was so intense and suriname 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.240
 from that of semnan of a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 intense form and then says do not know know 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.220
 that I am perfect did not create me or 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 and nothing was more within the nobel 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.229
 street literature and finding how on the street 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.869
 the first is totally in the making 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.920
 which defines fully 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.170
 unjustified and people looking at 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 Multicine is out of the new law mainly 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 of people's health 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 for this reason did not confirm the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 existence of a novel at first 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.670
 View 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.200
 I wanted to assume a radical and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.880
 mentality and behavior of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 characters that they lived in albino 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 visit from the first moment 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.579
 my person to this other person 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 surely these romantic people 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.840
 people almost and he never had 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 hair profile matching a kind of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 and the flower between the characters is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.750
 always a completely normal process and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.689
 asked to see what is believed and what 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.670
 novel is that the author was the author 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 explains what the elements are 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.750
 the details of the circumstances by 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.759
 What are the Taurasi target characters ? 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 obviously created and love at first sight 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.430
 so it would not be a romantic person 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.380
 it goes beyond the reaction of people 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.970
 and did not want to follow the steps to 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.480
 dating I know that dating is our 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.399
 culture 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.110
 otherwise we go to each of the steps 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.570
 wants to follow the characters Catarina 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.850
 we can drink with them a little 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.890
 little this process can per year 100 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.020
 could be able to experience the same 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.740
 thin they feel very familiar with a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.570
 example in the novel that nobody sings of 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.640
 true that the pain and recommend my 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.230
 boyfriend from start to finish who is 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 totally unjustified 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 we want two people who little 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730
 little is encountering one of the defects and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.830
 virtues 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
 the other person respecting each one 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.360
 of its elements to the end and dating 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 so it has not been written in the last year 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.500
 authors who have no transit novel 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.570
 exclusively in the list of 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.209
 characters that justifies the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.520
 girl when she was about to get up 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.350
 the bottom of the class when the girl 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.880
 character sending message moment 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.040
 perfect because everything needs 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.470
 haunt is there to realize this 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.750
 I hug that clean word that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.209
 needs no perfect moment is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
 only ladies and gentlemen are elements that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.680
 the reasons are the streets by which we 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.720
 We can take someone else's girlfriend. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.540
 obviously for example why this year 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.610
 changed the only noise not all 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.600
 authors justify their 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.010
 novels that last novels within 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.250
 Russian literature however Spanish 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:35.830
 as nobody is instant eternal iptu 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:40.900
 and the increase of 1 in the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.030
 first seen for example from the first 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.769
 shift on Sunday choose the club account 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.720
 this time with two characters the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.310
 border with we notify protest in the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.860
 totally different world are enemies 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.769
 mortals are similar for the first time 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.750
 time and already know that if the mother forever 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.209
 How do you get in love at first? 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.400
 Peruvian views and this time do not want 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.380
 better security so many others 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.079
 two people already after better know 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.940
 that one loves and if she declares directly 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.850
 because the first 30 pages of a 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.440
 tier 1 tends to have no army at 1 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.660
 two teens who sent us 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.700
 have is that you only wanting absolute 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.560
 I want theory deep so she 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.690
 was often in 2010 going from a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.940
 deep love there was not a deep 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.580
 sense of what happened one year ago in a curve 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.740
 for example in each one is only big flame 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.680
 first shift is essential the ps has 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.170
 Perfect sound in the par in and marrone 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.030
 second shift we passed another extreme 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.220
 lies in a clear example of love 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.590
 past teenager the issues of 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.270
 energy without homeland atrophy in the first 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.840
 List to stay with her I'm kind of 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.820
 athlete 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.440
 this time by the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.820
 there the woman of love pressure many 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.370
 when you read nobel literature 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.110
 street level that kind of bid him those 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.060
 others are of great interest against 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.770
 this change wants to justify Africa if 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.840
 the crisis is of the river there are many others 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.340
 initiatives that do not treat me the end of 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.750
 a soap opera because if you want to have 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.180
 relationship that supports the majority of 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.520
 part of the plot is not urban culture is 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.410
 Another example of roman was very bad 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.790
 have been among Cuban literature ypsi 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.620
 first volume of the trilogy knows that 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.660
 Mancini is Wesley who is trying to play and 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.130
 work a little by little to the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.380
 side of all pages of all 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.690
 chapters will be getting smaller 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.100
 details small arguments that I do not 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.320
 I understand that all the fish that the 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.970
 characters are going to date and doctor in 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.740
 a small screen in the first chapter that 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.930
 characters that follow on top of those 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.880
 that little by little we will see details that 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.590
 he could even say that it is for them that 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.510
 they can lead to unintentional dating 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.850
 What is this in the urban 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.310
 of closer proximity as they say 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.200
 to be listening to these marias in the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.790
 coffee breaks and two who have 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.740
 respect to literature to comply with and 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.570
 share with others and the logic 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.860
 of the novel this first list occupies no 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.630
 there will be a pair of lime sneakers 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.590
 semifinals as a symbol of cinema 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.210
 with papers 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.710
 this company yet many friends 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.690
 here he made many comments about the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.430
 that we offer goals on the raise this 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.840
 girl is good level of rivals every 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.460
 day that made me throughout the area 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.490
 software and modulate but the first 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.250
 would be a single and juliana muller neighborhood 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.250
 government village or mcdonnell sky de perm
