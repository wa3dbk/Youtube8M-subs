00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 and 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.580
 all right 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 let's do the unboxing of this camera 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.990
 go pro hero 3 black edition before 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.930
 nothing I want to tell you a little about 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 the prices on what is included 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.750
 in the box and a little bit of your 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.540
 Specifications 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 so it's good that in this camera I could 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 get at a price of 6 thousand 999 pesos 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.970
 in sambors and I also bought the side that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.990

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.660
 gigabytes that is this this I came out on 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.910
 819 pesos so well I decided to do 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.520
 this purchase because many of you have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 been asking for tutorials about motorcycles 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.040

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 tips and practical things to do 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.510
 previously have carried out several 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.489
 videos of these but they have been theoretical 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
 that's how well I gave myself to the task of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 acquire this camera to be able to do them 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.480

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.790
 practical issues 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.940
 let's do a boxing of this this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.750

 qualities can we take the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.110
 Photography 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.640
 Well, well, let's do the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.530

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.700
 from here 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.390
 here we have nothing, we are in a 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.569
 side this game that has a kind 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.030
 of 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.860
 like dior is a kind of glue 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.140
 let's detect it social 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.890
 we went 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.980
 let's break it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.980

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.260
 we manage the taste aside too 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260

 this is a small credit by your side 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.050

 this is the 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.260
 in the back of the to put the 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.560
 camera is if we take it away from us 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.470
 let's be able to record under the water with 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.200
 this and with this note we have what it is

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.890
 keychain what is lake but that's how 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.670
 well this would be everything that includes what 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.590
 this package is that they 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.980
 I remember that it is something own 3 black 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.320
 edition practically because this is what 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.480
 which includes does not include what is the 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.260
 micro sd that's why I had to 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.150
 buy apart I tell you that this is 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.650
 type of cameras that use a micro 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:18.560
 SD 610 as we can see here 6 10 in 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.710
 this case, I bought it from 32 yo 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.050
 I recommend that you do not buy the 64 GB 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.820
 because because I've been reading in 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.790
 different blogs 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.190
 this kind of memories of 64 gb in 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.250
 special lake pro hero 3 black edition 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.400
 you burn them that way, well, that's why 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.900
 I bought the 32 for security 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.000
 practically that would be all I hope that 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.920

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.760
