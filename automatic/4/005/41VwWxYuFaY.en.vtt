00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hi, people, I'm here again, right? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 getting lots of videos spheres is and the video 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.360
 it is different is not directly 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.950
 related to makeup but 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 care is usually at a stage that I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.260
 I'm reading a lot. It 's a subject. 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.810
 so on blogs 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.240
 I always quilombo things and always I 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.849
 I learn something new so I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 I try to test as fast as possible 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.500
 I've done a lot of this I thought I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.149
 I can not video sharing all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.059
 these things I 've learned one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.100
 not necessarily all of these 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 things I talk about now I've learned to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.809
 little do not have some tips that I already do 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.320
 for centuries in treatments will say 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.480
 like this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 and the ones that really surprise 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 recently but I'm commenting on the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.379
 item by item has 17 treatments one 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 related to hair and others with 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 skin is the first process we are going 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 so is the egg white this 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 ideal treatment for having a skin 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 with dilated pores 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.369
 the person who spoke the following takes water 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.130
 a warm washcloth with lukewarm water and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.340
 preference is passed on the face after 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 It has also washed and this breaks or 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 separates only the clear gem and reserves more 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.869
 will not walk hand in hand 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 there are people who say that it's already good for 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.580
 get on top I've never done it then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 It's finally over there, you get it clear. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.960
 after applying the washcloth with water 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 It's too hot to dilate your pores. 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.009
 I like to see the brush noise I 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 I think it stays, but you do not have to move. 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.450
 Put your hand in the light, I'll get it. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.420
 commercial basis after having applied 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 the warm water on the face I apply the clear 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.149
 and leave it for about 20 minutes you 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.189
 will see has not smell bad smell 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.159
 even it's the gem 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.380
 of course it does not smell and so it is not a 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.800
 thing that bothers me she'll be falling 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.480
 only 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.600
 c in paul then you will feel that the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.729
 their positions so close and I like 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.220
 to complete this process with the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.610
 Ice, I'll close it myself. 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.460
 all poles and treatment is good because 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.590
 It saves a lot of stress and it's the dollar. 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.840
 so much to close the pores 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.600
 The second tip is for those who want to have the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.050
 hair very soft winner use that is 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.410
 even clearer honey yoghurt capillary 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.910
 This mask is great because it has only 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.000
 two ingredients is a good thing 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.160
 simple and leaves the hair super soft and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 super gostoso there are people who put people 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.400
 I even did it when I left a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.680
 I liked it once. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.960
 only recently the film the wizard of 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.590
 olive oil I overdone and also for more 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.950
 anything 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.320
 So I guess I just liked honey and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.930
 They give the message if you want to lay an 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 a little of your hydration mask 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.590
 normal to give a hydration also 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 It can be either 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.989
 the then sometimes mixture of yogurt with 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.739
 honey ee put apply on hair leaves 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.200
 about 25 minutes longer the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.020
 effect will make the third tip is 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.209
 related to exfoliation you want was to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.890
 skin to stay very soft as well 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.500
 beautiful is only sugar sugar is great 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 You need soap in nothing but a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
 A little bit but taking care that you 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.480
 do not press hard not to be in 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.400
 your skin will not lightly stay 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400
 wonderful and also has the choice are 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.470
 for the lips that many people know 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.720
 What is sugar like mine? 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.330
 There are people who make olive oil and I already did 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.430
 but what I do not like the kids yes 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.709
 but I do not like what's left of it 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.560
 feeling around the user 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.239
 Know it all well then just go but I will not 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.730
 like agony I'd rather do with 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.860
 honey that gives one even in the end passes a 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.070
 bar 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.290
 come on they super soft very good 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.080
 room treatments more simple and agile 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.310
 that I always say I've separated the two 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.860
 that I have here the clay sells and 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.860
 white clay that fell here 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.350
 Israel without 32 white clay is the ideal 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.070
 with a more sensitive skin normal to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.190
 dry that is the name of the already green afternoon 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.770
 here it is great for oily skin because 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.919
 It takes all speed and it's good that 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.370
 both clays are placed on the skin if 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:39.010
 feel that pulling sensation, you know. 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.840
 I felt nothing more I see that in the white but 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.340
 They both feel that way. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.620
 cool but used very good and then see 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.530
 It dries much faster than it is white. 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.080
 stayed there she stays spoken when she is 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.419
 dry starts to crack and then you 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.350
 you feel the skin dry 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.389
 delight and white feels well but she 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.320
 This happens well in the late afternoon 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.930
 process 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.300
 You can find the clays in i love 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.040

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.440
 hair knows that hair is a 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.260
 that everyone already knows several 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.020
 people do that is from the vinegar goods 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.970
 five tablespoons of vinegar and two 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.630
 spoons of water is just to mix and stand 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.220
 in the hair 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.680
 The smell is really a little chatinho but the 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.840
 The result was incredible only with the hair 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.950
 seems to have domineering hair stays 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.870

 mixing mixture does not place the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.729
 filled with water and left to soak in the 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.150

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.279
 little 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.539
 so it just requires that people expect that 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.189
