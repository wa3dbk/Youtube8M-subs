here<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:00.989> are<00:00:01.020> doing<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.439> back<00:00:01.979> muscles<00:00:02.550> and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
here we are doing this back muscles and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.010 
here we are doing this back muscles and
we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> divide<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.510> back<00:00:03.689> into

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
we're going to divide the back into

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.530 
we're going to divide the back into
three<00:00:04.589> specific<00:00:04.890> layers<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:06.089> superficial

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
three specific layers the superficial

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.500 
three specific layers the superficial
back<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.379> deep<00:00:07.560> back<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:09.210> intermediate

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
back the deep back and the intermediate

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.330 
back the deep back and the intermediate
back<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.290> all<00:00:10.469> three<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.800> those<00:00:10.889> superficial

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
back so all three of those superficial

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
back so all three of those superficial
enemy<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.150> deep<00:00:12.360> back<00:00:12.570> all<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.990> different

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
enemy and deep back all have different

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.990 
enemy and deep back all have different
muscles<00:00:13.590> accordingly<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:14.849> you'll<00:00:14.969> find

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
muscles accordingly and what you'll find

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.029 
muscles accordingly and what you'll find
is<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.330> superficial<00:00:15.809> back<00:00:16.139> has<00:00:16.410> five<00:00:16.740> muscles

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is a superficial back has five muscles

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.620 
is a superficial back has five muscles
all<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.730> will<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.359> try<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
all of them will go and try to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
all of them will go and try to
accommodate<00:00:19.289> those<00:00:19.980> muscles<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:21.500> moving<00:00:22.609> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
accommodate those muscles of moving the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
accommodate those muscles of moving the
excellent<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> axillary<00:00:25.680> skeleton

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
excellent the from the axillary skeleton

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.589 
excellent the from the axillary skeleton
to<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> appendicular<00:00:26.699> skeleton<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.420> what

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
to the appendicular skeleton so what

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.849 
to the appendicular skeleton so what
we're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> find<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> five<00:00:28.380> muscles<00:00:28.740> all

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
we're going to find is five muscles all

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
we're going to find is five muscles all
together<00:00:29.160> two<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:29.460> prominent<00:00:29.849> muscles<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
together two very prominent muscles the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
together two very prominent muscles the
first<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.070> call<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> trapezius

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
first one is what we call the trapezius

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.280 
first one is what we call the trapezius
is<00:00:33.000> named<00:00:33.210> according<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.570> shape<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.110> quite

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
is named according to shape it's quite

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.740 
is named according to shape it's quite
trapezoid<00:00:34.920> shape<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.149> trapezius

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
trapezoid shape and that's the trapezius

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
trapezoid shape and that's the trapezius
so<00:00:37.050> trapezius<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> inferior<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so trapezius and then just inferior to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
so trapezius and then just inferior to
that<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.930> will<00:00:40.110> find<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.829> muscle<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.520> kind

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that it will find this muscle that kind

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
that it will find this muscle that kind
of<00:00:41.820> tucks<00:00:42.090> itself<00:00:42.390> underneath<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of tucks itself underneath it this is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.520 
of tucks itself underneath it this is
the<00:00:44.160> latissimus<00:00:44.820> dorsi<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> most<00:00:46.230> lateral

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the latissimus dorsi as in most lateral

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
the latissimus dorsi as in most lateral
and<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> dorsal<00:00:47.399> side<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and on the dorsal side so that's the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
and on the dorsal side so that's the
latissimus<00:00:48.780> dorsi<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> trapezius<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
latissimus dorsi so trapezius and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.819 
latissimus dorsi so trapezius and
latissimus<00:00:51.360> dorsi<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.379> were<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> cut

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
latissimus dorsi if I were to cut

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.740 
latissimus dorsi if I were to cut
trapezius<00:00:53.640> away<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.120> origin<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
gate down the c7 through t12 spinous
processes<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.399> flip<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.699> over<00:01:02.910> you'd<00:01:03.239> find

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
processes and flip it over you'd find

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
processes and flip it over you'd find
these<00:01:03.719> three<00:01:04.049> muscles<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> row<00:01:04.769> lining<00:01:05.700> up

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
these three muscles in a row lining up

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.100 
these three muscles in a row lining up
on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.939> medial<00:01:06.330> border<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> scapula

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
on the medial border of the scapula

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
on the medial border of the scapula
being<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> next<00:01:08.369> three<00:01:08.909> superficial<00:01:09.510> back

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
being the next three superficial back

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
being the next three superficial back
muscles<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.250> rhomboid<00:01:12.150> major

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
muscles so this is the rhomboid major

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
muscles so this is the rhomboid major
you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> rhombus<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you can see it's a rhombus kind of a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
you can see it's a rhombus kind of a
tilted<00:01:15.180> square<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.110> guy<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
tilted square this guy right here a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
tilted square this guy right here a
little<00:01:17.310> bit<00:01:17.580> smaller<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.960> smaller

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
little bit smaller actually much smaller

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
little bit smaller actually much smaller
the<00:01:19.530> rhomboid<00:01:19.920> minor<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.580> coming<00:01:21.210> up

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the rhomboid minor and then coming up

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
the rhomboid minor and then coming up
from<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> superior<00:01:22.080> angle<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> scapula

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
from the superior angle of the scapula

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
from the superior angle of the scapula
that<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.680> soup<00:01:25.680> levator<00:01:26.640> scapulae<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that is the soup levator scapulae so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
that is the soup levator scapulae so
elevates<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> scapula<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.640> five<00:01:29.909> again

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
elevates the scapula so these five again

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
elevates the scapula so these five again
of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> superficial<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.790> trapezius<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of the superficial back trapezius the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
of the superficial back trapezius the
trapezius<00:01:34.560> latissimus<00:01:35.189> dorsi<00:01:35.420> rhomboid

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
trapezius latissimus dorsi rhomboid

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.780 
trapezius latissimus dorsi rhomboid
major<00:01:36.689> rhomboid<00:01:37.619> minor<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.280> levator

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
major rhomboid minor and then levator

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
major rhomboid minor and then levator
scapulae<00:01:40.070> alright<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.490> those<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> five

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
scapulae alright so those are the five

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
scapulae alright so those are the five
superficial<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.750> muscles<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.409> them

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
superficial back muscles we can see them

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.249 
superficial back muscles we can see them
also<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.430> model<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.049> only

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
superior fibers of the trapezius here

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
superior fibers of the trapezius here
and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> latissimus<00:01:52.259> dorsi<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.860> here

and then the latissimus dorsi down here

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
and then the latissimus dorsi down here
as<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> rhomboid<00:01:54.299> major<00:01:54.479> rumble<00:01:54.960> minor

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
as for the rhomboid major rumble minor

as for the rhomboid major rumble minor
levator<00:01:55.560> SCAP<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> doesn't<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> any<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.729> you

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
levator SCAP it doesn't have any as you

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.980 
levator SCAP it doesn't have any as you
can<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> remove<00:01:57.719> them

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
can see it's just going to remove them

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
can see it's just going to remove them
in<00:01:58.619> comparison<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.880> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
in comparison we can actually see that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
in comparison we can actually see that
in<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> intermediate<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:01.350> muscles

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in some of the intermediate back muscles

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
in some of the intermediate back muscles
we<00:02:01.979> actually<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> two<00:02:03.060> muscles

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we actually see one of the two muscles

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.249 
we actually see one of the two muscles
that<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.540> responsible<00:02:03.810> for

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that you're responsible for

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
that you're responsible for
underneath<00:02:05.009> rhomboid<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.790> actually<00:02:06.119> be

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
underneath rhomboid would actually be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.169 
underneath rhomboid would actually be
the<00:02:06.509> serratus<00:02:07.409> posterior<00:02:07.740> superior<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.090> we

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the serratus posterior superior but we

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.550 
the serratus posterior superior but we
don't<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.750> can't<00:02:09.929> remove<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
don't see because we can't remove it and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
don't see because we can't remove it and
of<00:02:11.039> course<00:02:11.250> looking<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.879> model<00:02:12.060> it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
of course looking at this model it's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
of course looking at this model it's
completely<00:02:12.840> gone<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
completely gone and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
completely gone and
so<00:02:13.830> down<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.370> actually<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so down here we actually see the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.630 
so down here we actually see the
serratus<00:02:15.660> posterior<00:02:16.080> inferior<00:02:16.890> you'll

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
serratus posterior inferior you'll

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
serratus posterior inferior you'll
notice<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.240> switch<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:19.110> they

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
notice that we switch it because they

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.130 
notice that we switch it because they
were<00:02:19.320> intermediate<00:02:19.860> back<00:02:20.040> moving<00:02:20.670> away<00:02:20.880> from

these<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.170> accessory<00:02:28.560> respiratory<00:02:29.130> muscles

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
these are accessory respiratory muscles

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
these are accessory respiratory muscles
and<00:02:29.610> that's<00:02:29.730> why<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.910> fall<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and that's why I fall this and you

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.910 
and that's why I fall this and you
breathe<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:30.930> hard<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.410> an<00:02:31.530> asthma

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
breathe really hard like an asthma

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.400 
breathe really hard like an asthma
attack<00:02:32.190> or<00:02:32.220> something<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:33.210> them<00:02:33.330> sore<00:02:33.630> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
attack or something you get them sore so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.080 
attack or something you get them sore so
you'll<00:02:34.650> find<00:02:34.920> them<00:02:35.100> right<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.880> right

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you'll find them right here and right

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.510 
you'll find them right here and right
here<00:02:36.120> superior<00:02:37.370> serratus<00:02:38.370> posterior

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
underneath the rhomboid major but we

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.610 
underneath the rhomboid major but we
don't<00:02:44.070> actually<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.690> one<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.440> then

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
don't actually see it this one also then

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.860 
don't actually see it this one also then
has<00:02:46.770> some<00:02:46.950> deep<00:02:47.190> back<00:02:47.550> muscles<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.510> notice

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
has some deep back muscles as you notice

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.180 
has some deep back muscles as you notice
this<00:02:48.960> one<00:02:49.020> has<00:02:49.170> no<00:02:49.470> intermediate<00:02:50.040> back

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
this one has no intermediate back

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 
this one has no intermediate back
muscles<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> defect<00:02:51.300> muscles<00:02:51.660> we're<00:02:51.810> not

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
muscles but the defect muscles we're not

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.090 
muscles but the defect muscles we're not
going<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.050> delete<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> into<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.800> different

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
going to delete it into the different

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.770 
going to delete it into the different
layers<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.610> deep<00:02:53.730> metals<00:02:54.270> we're<00:02:54.660> just

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
layers of the deep metals we're just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.730 
layers of the deep metals we're just
going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> point<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.200> some<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> muscles

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
going to point out some of the muscles

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.410 
going to point out some of the muscles
that<00:02:55.770> we<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.240> talk<00:02:57.390> about

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that we have and so when we talk about

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.820 
that we have and so when we talk about
deep<00:02:57.750> back<00:02:57.900> muscles<00:02:58.230> let's<00:02:58.380> take<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> look<00:02:58.740> at

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
deep back muscles let's take a look at

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.670 
deep back muscles let's take a look at
the<00:02:58.950> neck<00:02:59.930> identifying<00:03:00.930> these<00:03:01.110> muscles<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the neck identifying these muscles the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220 
the neck identifying these muscles the
first<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:03.270> guy<00:03:03.480> right<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.720> coming

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
first one is this guy right here coming

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
first one is this guy right here coming
across<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> head<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.700> called

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
across going to the head this is called

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.960 
across going to the head this is called
the<00:03:06.030> splenius<00:03:06.740> capitis<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:07.950> splenius<00:03:08.340> capitis

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the splenius capitis so splenius capitis

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.420 
the splenius capitis so splenius capitis
going<00:03:09.660> up<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.020> head<00:03:10.230> kind<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.860> going<00:03:11.160> into

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
going up to the head kind of going into

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
going up to the head kind of going into
the<00:03:11.550> side<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.030> kind<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.330> forming<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> V<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.470> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the side and kind of forming a V if you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740 
the side and kind of forming a V if you
can<00:03:13.680> imagine<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.610> V<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:15.660> we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
can imagine so like it's a V but then we

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.580 
can imagine so like it's a V but then we
switch<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.560> straight<00:03:16.980> up<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.220> down

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
switch it to going straight up and down

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.080 
switch it to going straight up and down
longitudinally<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.890> underneath<00:03:20.459> directly

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
longitudinally this underneath directly

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
would be the semi spine Allis capitis so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.150 
would be the semi spine Allis capitis so

last types of muscle is called the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.670 
last types of muscle is called the
rotators<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:09.060> little<00:04:09.630> bit<00:04:09.750> well<00:04:10.050> some

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
rotators and a little bit well some

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.960 
rotators and a little bit well some
people<00:04:10.800> have<00:04:10.950> contested<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.580> these<00:04:11.760> are

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
people have contested that these are

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.159 
people have contested that these are
multifidus<00:04:12.930> but<00:04:13.489> either<00:04:14.489> one<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.989> would

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
multifidus but either one so I would

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.990 
multifidus but either one so I would
just<00:04:16.260> call<00:04:16.440> these<00:04:16.620> rotators<00:04:17.190> those<00:04:17.850> are

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
just call these rotators those are

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.570 
just call these rotators those are
rotator<00:04:18.660> muscles<00:04:18.720> which<00:04:19.350> go<00:04:19.590> from<00:04:19.770> transverse

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
rotator muscles which go from transverse

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.330 
rotator muscles which go from transverse
processes<00:04:21.030> spinous<00:04:21.480> process<00:04:22.040> cutting<00:04:23.040> across

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
processes spinous process cutting across

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.310 
processes spinous process cutting across
and<00:04:23.640> then<00:04:23.729> multiple<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.330> tends<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.600> jump

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
and then multiple just tends to jump

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.260 
and then multiple just tends to jump
more<00:04:25.620> than<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.190> one

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
more than just one

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.119 
more than just one
-<00:04:27.569> processor<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:28.229> vertebrae<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:28.979> we'll

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
- processor one vertebrae and so we'll

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.490 
- processor one vertebrae and so we'll
find<00:04:29.370> these<00:04:29.610> there<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.539> there's<00:04:31.229> plenty<00:04:31.440> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
find these there so there's plenty of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.540 
find these there so there's plenty of
other<00:04:31.650> ones<00:04:31.800> those<00:04:32.250> are<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.430> ones

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
other ones those are the ones

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.809 
other ones those are the ones
responsible<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:33.229> in<00:04:34.229> our<00:04:35.160> class<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.699> so

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
responsible for in our class and so

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.180 
responsible for in our class and so
these<00:04:36.030> are<00:04:36.090> our<00:04:36.270> rotators<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.110> that's<00:04:38.039> our
