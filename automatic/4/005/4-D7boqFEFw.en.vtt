00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello and welcome to the 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.160
 first part of road to millions yes that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.049
 is now a new series I make 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 will 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.370
 I have a new club for that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.490
 founded coffee tea and yes I will 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.960
 So start now from 0 and so to speak 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.220
 me to a million high and act 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.520
 yet I will give you tips and then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.580
 Tricks show how you could act well 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.099
 and yes, that's a certainty 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.250
 initial capital have we watch now 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.710
 First of all in the club and look 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.440
 which players we can sell there 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.649
 this is this silver player we 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.920
 in our starter pack had one with 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 4 1 212 formations and 77 tempo 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.949
 I think we will get sold well 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 I'll put you then directly for 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.729
 I put it on 600 and then for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.589
 three hours the other three players 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.210
 Here I try the first three too 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.770
 for sale because you have good information 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 have and are not so bad for 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.170
 bronze player the rest of the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 remaining players I will repel 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 and I'm putting it on here now 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 for 200 i will not be worth more 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.780
 We'll be the only ones with luck 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.260
 can sell and yes the rest 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 I'll come back and play 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.820
 then we have a coworker here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.310
 I put a manager in 43 12 too 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.760
 maybe just for 200 maybe 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 he is also sold and the club 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940
 We can not sell objects though 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 namely the consumer goods we namely 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.490
 Once we can do that for fitness 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 250 sell both parts here and the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.520
 we will not sell contracts 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.830
 There may be too much cure 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 Maybe I do not think so 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.120
 and yes then I'll call you right back 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 if we have sold everything until the same 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.860
 as you can see we have everything now 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 sells the silver player for 600 den 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.900
 brawny players 450 the fitness cards 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.740
 for 250 each and also what I do not 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.910
 thought 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.210
 the cure card for 200 and yes us 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.780
 act now at the beginning with the silver 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.370
 Jersey and crest method and straight 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.950
 also looked for a club but we 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.980
 make it different now and we give 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.880
 namely silver here and there at 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 minimum price 200 and dania 1 200 so 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.140
 really only things come on the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.880
 which are a little valuable and look 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.610
 then on what things already commanded 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:51.390
 was and then look this is here 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.180
 for example the pescara jersey and the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.600
 then we enter and see how 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.950
 much that is worth it at the moment i am me 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.840
 already too far up there and this is coming 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.510
 Let's give away 500 1 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.739
 and there comes 14 500 that means we can 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.280
 We offer 250 seats 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.980
 we will 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.500
 then let's see if we can do that now 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.770
 the jersey will win the auction 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.370
 for the jersey and yes we have that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.570
 shirt 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.450
 won the auction for the jersey and yes 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.590
 this method with the silver carrier 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 I'll go a bit further now 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.620
 make it until we reach the 1000 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.050
 remaining 1500 people consumed here 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.940
 and then I'll show you right away 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.150
 which jerseys I still prefer 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.690
