we're<00:00:06.210> still<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.629> need<00:00:06.810> some<00:00:07.109> work<00:00:08.809> we<00:00:09.809> ignore

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
we're still you need some work we ignore

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're still you need some work we ignore
best<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:14.000> got<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.210> point<00:00:16.760> how

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
best because you have got the point how

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.700 
best because you have got the point how
we<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:19.730> draw<00:00:20.730> some<00:00:21.480> curves<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.020> cut<00:00:22.230> them<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
we can draw some curves and cut them and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
we can draw some curves and cut them and
then<00:00:23.029> how<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.539> rebuild<00:00:24.990> them<00:00:25.849> so<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
then how we can rebuild them so this is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
then how we can rebuild them so this is
a<00:00:27.570> time<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> create<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:30.420> second<00:00:31.460> right<00:00:32.460> side

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a time to create this second right side

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.560 
a time to create this second right side

this case we are not going to the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.330 
this case we are not going to the
options<00:01:27.810> window<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.450> done<00:01:30.720> already<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.419 

this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> second<00:01:36.119> curve<00:01:36.799> we<00:01:37.799> shall<00:01:38.070> repeat

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
this is the second curve we shall repeat

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.029 
this is the second curve we shall repeat
the<00:01:38.640> same<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.610> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.789> done<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
the same things as we have done for the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.010 
the same things as we have done for the
previous<00:01:44.039> shape

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
previous shape

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.140 
previous shape
move<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.940 

we're<00:01:49.750> upwards

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.770 

which<00:01:53.520> here

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.050 

yeah

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
yeah

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.880 
yeah
and<00:01:59.330> then<00:01:59.800> there's<00:02:00.800> fine

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
and then there's fine

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.100 
and then there's fine
this<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.760> time<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.210> rebuild<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.810> curve

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
this is the time to rebuild this curve

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.280 
this is the time to rebuild this curve
but<00:02:05.410> first<00:02:05.680> we<00:02:05.860> need<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.250> check<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.290> quantity

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
but first we need to check the quantity

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
but first we need to check the quantity
of<00:02:08.670> spawns<00:02:09.990> by<00:02:10.990> using<00:02:12.090> perv<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.390> rebuilt<00:02:13.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
of spawns by using perv have rebuilt a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.520 
of spawns by using perv have rebuilt a
modify<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.890> shape<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.580> curve<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.530> hide

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
modify the shape of the curve and hide

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.370 
modify the shape of the curve and hide
this<00:02:20.830> curve<00:02:21.100> for<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.610> time<00:02:22.110> hiding<00:02:23.110> this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
this curve for this time hiding this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.770 
this curve for this time hiding this
curve<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.680> have<00:02:23.830> two<00:02:24.250> ways<00:02:24.520> by<00:02:25.000> clicking<00:02:25.480> ctrl

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
curve you have two ways by clicking ctrl

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.710 
curve you have two ways by clicking ctrl
s<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.380> hide<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.740> curve<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:28.330> well<00:02:28.540> as

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
s you can hide the curve and as well as

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
s you can hide the curve and as well as
if<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:30.000> created<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.210> layer<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.970> will

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
if you have created a layer and you will

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.640 
if you have created a layer and you will
layer<00:02:36.150> first

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
layer first

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.970 
layer first
right

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
right

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420 
right
spend

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.710 

then<00:02:45.970> save<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:47.760> right-click<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.970> there<00:02:49.299> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
then save that right-click on there and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.330 
then save that right-click on there and
add<00:02:50.019> selected<00:02:50.590> object

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
add selected object

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.589 
add selected object
now<00:02:51.909> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.409> invisibility<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.330> again

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
now you can invisibility you can again

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.300 
now you can invisibility you can again
make<00:02:56.560> visible<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.250> click<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.819> curl<00:02:59.310> but

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
make visible that click the curl but

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.180 
make visible that click the curl but
still<00:03:00.580> we<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.239> curve<00:03:01.599> which<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.319> not<00:03:02.680> no

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
still we have this curve which is not no

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.180 
still we have this curve which is not no
more<00:03:03.480> needed<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.569> our<00:03:04.690> saying<00:03:05.110> we<00:03:06.010> have

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
more needed in our saying we have

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.160 
more needed in our saying we have
already<00:03:06.459> created<00:03:07.620> surface<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.840> go<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
already created surface for that go and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.080 
already created surface for that go and
hide<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.150> polygons<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.739> then<00:03:14.849> drag<00:03:15.849> his

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
hide the polygons and then drag his

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.160 
hide the polygons and then drag his

these<00:03:18.770> four<00:03:19.099> curves<00:03:19.430> will<00:03:19.610> tell<00:03:19.849> them<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.810> have

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
these four curves will tell them we have

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.240 
these four curves will tell them we have
deleted<00:03:21.440> them<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:23.209> time<00:03:23.510> our<00:03:24.069> curves<00:03:25.069> is

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
deleted them and this time our curves is

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.070 
deleted them and this time our curves is
still<00:03:25.550> opened<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.800> we<00:03:27.800> need<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.160> close<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.730> and

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
still opened and we need to close it and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.610 
still opened and we need to close it and

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
if we do not close no matter just simply

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.520 
if we do not close no matter just simply
go<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> modify<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.970> cut<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.330> curve<00:03:35.569> right
