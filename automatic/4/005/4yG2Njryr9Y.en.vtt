00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.760
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.099
 now I come with the results of the 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.419
 day number 2 of the salad diet 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.850
 I want to tell you that I have been 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.180
 feeling with great energy I am 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.860
 surprised because I thought I was going to 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.839
 be very tired I remember that when 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.999
 I did the soup diet on the day 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.480
 number 2 was the hardest day I 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:27.249
 I wanted to stop because he almost did not like me 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.509
 the vegetables but yes yes that is if I 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.980
 they like vegetables but let's 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.590
 accompany them with meat and things like that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.450
 then this memory that in the day 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.060
 number 2 to my people so there are already here 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.000
 I want to stop because I was very hungry 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.790
 has noticed differently that now that I'm 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.790
 doing the diet of the salad me 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.950
 I feel more energized and I've had a lot 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.620
 less hungry because I've been eating 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.740
 a lot of salad I'm really eating 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 lots of salad 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.840
 I know what I do not like so 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.490
 much more our taste of onion 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 because it 's like that peak you know 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.900
 until I improve my eyes so I am 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.300
 eating but my sister told me that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.600
 put the onion in water and soak the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.240
 of water and takes away a little bit of flavor 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.810
 strong onion and then help 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.270
 that what I was doing I ate now 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 four servings of salad and also 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.610
 I was eating then the broccoli with my 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 cucumber 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.310
 Now I'm eating what I like 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.340
 I was eating nothing I do not know if I did 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.140
 enough exercise if half an hour in 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.420
 the elliptical machine and I did not run for 10 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.180
 minutes that is a breakthrough and good 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.580
 Well, that's all for today girls, I think 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.330
 and another thing that I wanted to mention to me 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.369
 He has been giving many of recollection 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.060
 feel that I feel like when I was in 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.190
 the diet of the three days that is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 eating egg whites and all that is not 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.690
 I know if you remember that those who looked at that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.390
 I diet all day while I had 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.190
 this much to be very thirsty then here 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.569
 they recommend you drink a lot of water that does not 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660
 it's like the other one they told you that nothing 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.000
 more I could take a liter then I was 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.500
 drinking a lot of water I do not know if it's going to be 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.220
 a lot of information what I'm going to tell you 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.569
 but the pity comes out clearly almost 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.209
 like water 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.780
 I have been this glass and how can 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.969
 see almost I finished it has been 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.609
 I count the glasses to give us the workshops 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.040
 of water and that's good because I think 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.700
 that helps eliminate toxins that in 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.709
 our body does not need then then 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.959

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.230
