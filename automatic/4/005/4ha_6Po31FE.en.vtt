 then 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.289
 hahaha patty 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 what to do with the puff pastry cuttings that come from various preparations 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.169
 well actually sometimes we find ourselves trying these bits 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.540
 what is a real spray what is pasta 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.530
 browse better fresh well take a ball and freeze when you drop it 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.730
 you have a good quantity do as I am doing now 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.780
 it is puff pastry, mind you 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.940
 and prepare the half puff pastry and with this we will make the famous ones 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.059
 neither bits nor cocktails ie you know those 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.389
 p slices that if you stern well, fresh hot are delicious 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:00.720
 hos served 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.750
 coldness staff is a few days are hideous gummy 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.120
 well i'm talking about those ones that they once did 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.170
 really the party made the difference rho one of the most things 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.080
 coveted 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.990
 at birthday parties at least when 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.510
 - I was a child and when I was young, there are now a thousand other bad things 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.759
 pieces of puff pastry, however, never lose their charm, and then 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.490
 some half puff pastry here it is 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.520
 then here we have the sauce we have some peeled tomatoes used in tomatoes 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.980
 peeled to have a homogeneity during the year. the real Neapolitan pizza for 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 always have the same taste 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.749
 so we have peeled tomatoes 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.310
 that we have of smoothie 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.340
 and we flavored with a spoonful of adel's oil cuttings since a nice one 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 ciuvin we put the jumpsuit you can put on a pizza as you like 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.680
 of the basil of the oregano the whole is here in here here it is now 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.460
 let's mix it up, of course 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.800
 ee now this point we mix it eeh uh we need the tomato away 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800
 I was lying cold when we see on the pizzas then the sauce should be prepared 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.429
 previously and we have not prepared 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:21.159
 here it is cold we keep it here next to us ready to use and meanwhile b 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.409
 by shade re-igniting or better the explanation of the half puff pastry 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.069
 then take air italy and make it a little like this take a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.069
 rolling pin 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.169
 pasta companies then walter pasta has always in one sense only 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.369
 starts from the base and goes forward 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.679
 here in this way if you move the dough to put it back in its place 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.399
 and let's go on like this 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:55.029
 we should be able to get quite regular with rt tangolo 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.029
 then here it is 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.689
 continue 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.060
 when the bench is no longer sufficient, we move to the side 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.749
 here we go 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.749
 to spend more 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 always all belfredo always a warm environment because you can for the story 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.759
 it was butter and very delicate 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.769
 but also the industrial one tends to start with 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.749
 heat and environmental milk with the warmth of the hands 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.179
 for if left out too long 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:44.289
 we have now kept a rectangle we need pompei model 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.799
 let's take a part 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.189
 let's try to extend it so colemar 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.899
 we support it 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.899
 let's brush off the flour 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
 we close with the other piece of cake 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.669
 we believe the flour away 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.679
 at this point we will have to wrap it all in the film hold 20 minutes 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.489
 minimum the fridge to rest 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.419
 to then resume the same dough 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.060
 now i show you how to start the other nokia tour and pretend to 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.199
 having it rest for 20 minutes at this point if we turn the edges well is 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.840
 fundamental because otherwise it tends to slip to all the parts we will not have 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.340
 never again a rectangle 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.059
 we make this world we seal 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.319
 and then we resume work before we spread the pasta always going into 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.919
 without ever going back we will ask a man in mind as before 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.349
 we will close it in the film that we will let it rest in the refrigerator until 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.830
 at the time of use 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.499
 now I remove this pasta because I am already ready 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.409
 free well cold cutlery 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:58.019
 here they are
