be so fun don't you guys think let me
know<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> comment<00:02:37.980> section<00:02:38.220> below<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
know in the comment section below if you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.870 
know in the comment section below if you
think<00:02:39.300> my<00:02:39.660> theory<00:02:40.050> could<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.620> correct<00:02:41.070> or<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
think my theory could be correct or this

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.120 
think my theory could be correct or this
is<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.270> pure<00:02:42.510> speculation<00:02:42.900> by<00:02:43.470> me<00:02:43.680> so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
is just pure speculation by me so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
is just pure speculation by me so
imagine<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.640> second<00:02:45.090> inform<00:02:45.390> comes<00:02:45.600> out<00:02:45.810> and

imagine a second inform comes out and
you<00:02:46.020> upgrade<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.010> imagine<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.550> third

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you upgrade that now imagine the third

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.580 
you upgrade that now imagine the third
inform<00:02:48.150> comes<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> upgrade<00:02:49.350> that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
inform comes out and you upgrade that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.830
