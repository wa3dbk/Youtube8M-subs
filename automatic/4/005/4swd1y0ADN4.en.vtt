00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
how that can be applied to actually

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.229 
how that can be applied to actually
teach<00:04:09.010> some<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.310> those<00:04:09.400> things<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.940> would<00:04:10.060> take

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
teach some of those things it would take

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.240 
teach some of those things it would take
like<00:04:10.480> hours<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:10.959> hours<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:11.830> we<00:04:12.010> kind<00:04:12.190> of

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250

like hours and hours and so we kind of
do<00:04:12.850> that<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.300> our<00:04:13.450> members<00:04:13.900> area<00:04:14.020> but<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.739> hope

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
do that in our members area but I hope

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.979 
do that in our members area but I hope
