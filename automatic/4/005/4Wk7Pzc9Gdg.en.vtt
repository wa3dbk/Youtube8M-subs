00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.529 
just little fundamentals I learned as a
kid<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.440> older<00:05:38.680> kids<00:05:38.979> like<00:05:39.250> 12<00:05:39.550> 13<00:05:39.639> 14

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
kid and the older kids like 12 13 14

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.200 
kid and the older kids like 12 13 14
years<00:05:40.960> old<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.440> really<00:05:42.070> emphasize<00:05:42.280> spare

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
years old I really emphasize spare

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.510 
years old I really emphasize spare
shooting<00:05:43.599> and<00:05:43.889> practice<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.039> take<00:05:45.219> a<00:05:45.280> lot<00:05:45.490> of

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
shooting and practice and take a lot of

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.749 
shooting and practice and take a lot of
time<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:46.030> really<00:05:46.389> focus<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:47.080> get<00:05:47.259> your<00:05:47.469> spare

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
time to really focus and get your spare

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.339 
time to really focus and get your spare
to<00:05:48.759> really<00:05:48.969> improve<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.360> game<00:05:49.509> yeah<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.289> I

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
to really improve the game yeah and I

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.629 
to really improve the game yeah and I
think<00:05:50.590> that<00:05:50.740> no<00:05:50.860> matter<00:05:50.889> if<00:05:51.219> you're<00:05:51.340> coaching

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
think that no matter if you're coaching

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.800 
think that no matter if you're coaching
someone<00:05:51.789> that's<00:05:52.000> 5<00:05:52.150> years<00:05:52.330> old<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.599> follow

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
someone that's 5 years old the follow

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.320 
someone that's 5 years old the follow
through<00:05:53.110> or<00:05:53.349> spares<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:54.400> 12<00:05:54.669> year<00:05:54.759> olds<00:05:54.909> it's

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
through or spares to 12 year olds it's

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.089 
through or spares to 12 year olds it's
still<00:05:55.570> things<00:05:55.750> that<00:05:55.900> we<00:05:56.020> work<00:05:56.229> on<00:05:56.380> today<00:05:56.800> as

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
still things that we work on today as

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.350 
still things that we work on today as
athletes<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:57.849> think<00:05:58.030> that's<00:05:58.180> really

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
athletes and I think that's really

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.700 
athletes and I think that's really
important<00:05:58.690> even<00:05:58.990> though<00:05:59.110> we're<00:05:59.530> coaching

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
important even though we're coaching

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.439 
important even though we're coaching
younger<00:06:00.190> players<00:06:00.400> it's<00:06:00.880> still<00:06:01.120> something<00:06:01.330> you

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
younger players it's still something you

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.820 
younger players it's still something you
always<00:06:01.719> have<00:06:01.840> to<00:06:01.960> manage<00:06:02.229> you<00:06:02.349> always<00:06:02.620> have<00:06:02.740> to

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
always have to manage you always have to

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.129 
always have to manage you always have to

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
books lately that really helped me with

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.100 
books lately that really helped me with
that<00:06:17.830> and<00:06:18.039> I<00:06:18.370> this<00:06:18.940> that's<00:06:19.449> why<00:06:19.570> I<00:06:19.599> did<00:06:19.810> so<00:06:19.930> well

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
that and I this that's why I did so well

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.959 
that and I this that's why I did so well
in<00:06:20.139> Vegas<00:06:20.590> is<00:06:20.740> because<00:06:20.949> my<00:06:21.099> mental<00:06:21.490> game<00:06:21.669> was

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
in Vegas is because my mental game was

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.999 
in Vegas is because my mental game was
the<00:06:22.240> best<00:06:22.449> it's<00:06:22.630> ever<00:06:22.690> been<00:06:22.990> yeah<00:06:23.710> it<00:06:23.860> doesn't

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
the best it's ever been yeah it doesn't

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.320 
the best it's ever been yeah it doesn't
really<00:06:24.130> seem<00:06:24.400> like<00:06:24.490> you<00:06:24.669> struggled<00:06:25.090> with<00:06:25.120> that

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
really seem like you struggled with that

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.719 
really seem like you struggled with that
very<00:06:25.539> much<00:06:25.810> so<00:06:26.110> maybe<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:27.009> was<00:06:27.219> the<00:06:27.370> ticket

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
very much so maybe that was the ticket

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.999 
very much so maybe that was the ticket
maybe<00:06:28.419> so<00:06:29.259> what<00:06:29.380> do<00:06:29.440> you<00:06:29.500> think<00:06:29.680> your<00:06:29.770> strength

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
maybe so what do you think your strength

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.670 
maybe so what do you think your strength
is<00:06:31.949> everything<00:06:32.949> right<00:06:33.099> now<00:06:33.130> I<00:06:33.930> guess<00:06:34.930> so

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
is everything right now I guess so

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.339 
is everything right now I guess so
well<00:06:36.070> I<00:06:36.099> guess<00:06:36.430> my<00:06:36.810> strength<00:06:37.810> would<00:06:37.990> probably

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
well I guess my strength would probably

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.650 
well I guess my strength would probably
be<00:06:39.089> experience

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
be experience

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.860 
be experience
