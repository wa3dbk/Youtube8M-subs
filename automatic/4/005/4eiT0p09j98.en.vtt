additional additional fees to stuff like

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
additional additional fees to stuff like
I<00:03:28.889> think<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.160> appearances<00:03:29.670> goals<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
I think it's appearances goals and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.789 
I think it's appearances goals and
international<00:03:31.170> appearances<00:03:31.470> there<00:03:31.620> from

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
international appearances there from

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.199 
international appearances there from
that<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.099> I<00:03:32.130> mean<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> good<00:03:32.519> deal<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:32.910> us

in<00:04:31.229> game<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.440> mean<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.190> there's<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.430> few<00:04:32.639> like<00:04:32.729> I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
in game I mean that there's a few like I

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.189 
in game I mean that there's a few like I
think<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.389> first<00:04:33.600> couple<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.900> games<00:04:33.960> were<00:04:34.169> a

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
think the first couple of games were a

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.320 
think the first couple of games were a
bit<00:04:35.040> poor<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.430> be<00:04:35.520> honest<00:04:35.760> but<00:04:36.060> Emory

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
bit poor to be honest but Emory

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.879 
bit poor to be honest but Emory
challenge<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.750> asymmetry<00:04:37.110> were<00:04:37.380> sent<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.710> mid
