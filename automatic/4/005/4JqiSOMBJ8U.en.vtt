00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.690
 Borussia was so kindly welcomed by the neighbor Captain 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.420
 Paul Hahn did the rest and left the couple to Berti Vogts 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 choice 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.849
 Fuchs immediately acted as a pick-me-up for the Turin Europe 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.029
 Cup plays reasonably abolished Borussia troop before he as if 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.050
 first personal contact with his direct opponent recordings 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.790
 Center-Forward Lübbecke last week in Offenbach at least two hits 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.920
 had achieved 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.590
 The first duel won rages without effort 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.220
 and was soon able to remember the assault moves of the others 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.550
 to join 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.940
 Tropez fought and ran as if it had Turin with the countless attacks of one 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 looks different 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.020
 that was not to be overlooked 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.310
 many direct comparisons were lost the much praised pace game of 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.590
 Borussia 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.940
 optically 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 It did not make anybody shout that was just crazy 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.410
 meant Aland Simon's Town 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 Paul Hahn the free man of the Würdinger organizer who fights off the game 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020
 in your own half 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.050
 his hesitant way of launching attacks shaped that level 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.870
 Meeting in the shadow of security First of all, that inevitably requires that 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.980
 Must push class of a game 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.260
 who did not necessarily want a prestige success of the riser 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.960
 got disappointed 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.600
 However, this finding can and should be the fighting power Lepperdinger 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 by no means diminish 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.280
 the following scene market, however, prove it as the climber against the champion 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.880
 would have happened 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 the Borussians had so much power 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 like Berti Vogts 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.270
 three times before 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.920
 and then from the attack back into the defense a man of international 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 More class than just the nation's lawnmower 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.030
 Here is a slow-motion study of the circumstance of the Gladbacher 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.069
 Underline attacking game 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.400
 from fox 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.320
 a pass with inaugurated dismantling in Brunotte must first run 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 it follows a long dribbling 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.689
 Heintges again 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.009
 the gap 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.009
 Dr shot very weak 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.939
 Since Paul could have relatively easily keep the overview because whenever the 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.450
 Meister appeared threatening at the penalty area 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.749
 the blondes were near the ball 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 Stilz in the majority 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.369
 just like here 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.369
 against 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.349
 Paul have in the header game hard to beat, neither in the defense 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.369
 who among the 23 outside 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.739
 had to be big until the 8 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.739
 Ute will be waiting for Gladbach after a corner kick from 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.439
 Würdinger seemed to have been forced to give themselves up 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.889
 then, however 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.939
 2 minutes and ten seconds before the end, replacement coach Patricia moved in 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.249
 Fox but his men's predictions 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.209
 Erpenstein had driven Gusti here to comfort 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.259
 Many a post office might be so
