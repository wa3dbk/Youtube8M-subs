00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that I know in the home series and so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.680 
that I know in the home series and so
far<00:00:13.620> I've<00:00:13.830> had<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.309> about<00:00:14.429> two<00:00:15.089> weeks<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
far I've had it for about two weeks I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.330 
far I've had it for about two weeks I
really<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:17.990> fairly<00:00:18.990> durable<00:00:19.350> machine<00:00:20.039> on

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
really like it fairly durable machine on

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.420 
really like it fairly durable machine on
the<00:00:20.939> metal<00:00:21.240> chrome<00:00:21.810> looking<00:00:22.680> parts<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the metal chrome looking parts are in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.870 
the metal chrome looking parts are in
fact<00:00:23.640> plastic<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.250> nothing<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
fact plastic so you know nothing the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.099 
fact plastic so you know nothing the
work<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.849> does<00:00:30.179> you'll<00:00:30.510> notice<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
work this does you'll notice that this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.900 
work this does you'll notice that this
does<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> reservoir<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.110> because

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
does not have a reservoir on it because

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.119 
does not have a reservoir on it because
to<00:00:35.910> compensate<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> size<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to compensate with the size it's a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.030 
to compensate with the size it's a
single<00:00:38.579> loader<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.420> will<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> you

single loader so you will have to you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030 
single loader so you will have to you
know<00:00:41.160> pour<00:00:41.489> whatever<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> pour<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.290> you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.690 

so<00:04:18.280> anyways<00:04:19.560> that's<00:04:20.560> all<00:04:20.709> there<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.459> I

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
so anyways that's all there is to it I

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.250

guess<00:04:22.120> we'll<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.300> hold<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.870> up<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.230> can

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
guess we'll just hold it up so you can

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.440 
guess we'll just hold it up so you can
see<00:04:23.560> how<00:04:23.740> quickly<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.160> brews<00:04:24.460> it's<00:04:25.240> fairly

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.890 
one more thing I forgot to mention um
the<00:05:02.979> cord<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.669> will<00:05:03.820> not<00:05:03.970> have<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.389> wrap<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.780> up

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
the cord you will not have to wrap it up

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.870 
the cord you will not have to wrap it up
when<00:05:05.110> storing<00:05:05.650> it<00:05:05.770> or<00:05:05.979> traveling<00:05:06.520> with<00:05:06.699> it

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
when storing it or traveling with it

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.350 
when storing it or traveling with it
because<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:08.020> cord<00:05:08.289> does<00:05:08.970> retract<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.240> you

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
because the cord does retract and you

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.900 
because the cord does retract and you
can<00:05:10.630> put<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:12.100> will<00:05:12.250> retract<00:05:12.699> back

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
can put it that it will retract back

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.760 
can put it that it will retract back
into<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> machine<00:05:13.780> so<00:05:14.229> you<00:05:14.259> don't<00:05:14.560> have<00:05:14.650> to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
into the machine so you don't have to

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:24.060 
into the machine so you don't have to
worry<00:05:14.949> about<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.310> messy<00:05:15.699> cord<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.650> with

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
worry about that messy cord and and with

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.620 
worry about that messy cord and and with
the<00:05:24.160> mini<00:05:24.370> series<00:05:24.669> since<00:05:25.120> there's<00:05:25.300> not<00:05:25.479> as

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
the mini series since there's not as

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.689 
the mini series since there's not as
much<00:05:25.840> water<00:05:26.259> going<00:05:26.590> into<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.919> cup<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.490> coffee

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
much water going into the cup of coffee

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.330 
much water going into the cup of coffee
you're<00:05:27.970> brewing<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:29.169> will<00:05:29.500> be<00:05:29.710> quite<00:05:30.009> a<00:05:30.039> bit

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
you're brewing it will be quite a bit

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.670 
you're brewing it will be quite a bit
stronger<00:05:30.729> which<00:05:31.180> is<00:05:31.389> not<00:05:31.840> something<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:32.410> mind

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
stronger which is not something I mind

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.790 
stronger which is not something I mind
personally<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:33.580> on<00:05:34.080> other<00:05:35.080> people<00:05:35.470> may<00:05:35.650> not

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
personally but on other people may not

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.620 
personally but on other people may not
care<00:05:36.070> for<00:05:36.099> that<00:05:37.810> but<00:05:38.340> that's<00:05:39.340> about<00:05:39.520> it

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
care for that but that's about it

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.199 
care for that but that's about it
thank<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.690> for<00:05:40.900> watching
