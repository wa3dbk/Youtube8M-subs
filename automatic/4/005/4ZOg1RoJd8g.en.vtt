sure<00:03:33.389> how<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.569> pronounce<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.139> I<00:03:34.349> saw<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.459> I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
sure how you pronounce it I saw it in I

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.370 
sure how you pronounce it I saw it in I
think<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.970> was<00:03:36.000> Lowe's<00:03:36.329> or<00:03:36.359> Home<00:03:36.569> Depot<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.139> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
think it was Lowe's or Home Depot and I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.420 
think it was Lowe's or Home Depot and I
just<00:03:37.560> thought<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.769> was<00:03:37.829> really<00:03:38.040> cool

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
just thought it was really cool

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.259 
just thought it was really cool
apparently<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.849> these<00:03:41.849> things<00:03:41.910> are

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
apparently it's like these things are

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.080 
apparently it's like these things are
supposed<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.540> turn<00:03:42.780> orange<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.470> guess<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.430> it's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
supposed to turn orange I guess and it's

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.199 
supposed to turn orange I guess and it's
like<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> lemony<00:03:45.930> limey<00:03:46.380> flavor<00:03:47.099> I'm<00:03:47.519> not<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
like a lemony limey flavor I'm not I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.240 
like a lemony limey flavor I'm not I
don't<00:03:48.329> know<00:03:48.450> I've<00:03:48.599> never<00:03:48.660> had<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.319> anyway

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
don't know I've never had it so anyway

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.500 
don't know I've never had it so anyway
so<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.609> plant<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:50.910> look<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.180> was<00:03:51.299> doing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
so the plant it look like it was doing

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.759
