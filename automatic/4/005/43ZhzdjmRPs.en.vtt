00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
charger and comes quite nicely a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.060 
charger and comes quite nicely a
standard<00:01:18.580> USB<00:01:19.150> charge<00:01:20.140> cable<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:20.920> will

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
standard USB charge cable you will

standard USB charge cable you will
notice<00:01:21.280> guys<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:21.820> did<00:01:21.970> read<00:01:22.150> this<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.420> box

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
notice guys I did read this on the box

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.300 
notice guys I did read this on the box
and<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.900> instructions<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.500> connector

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
and the instructions that connector

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.540 
and the instructions that connector
there<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:25.090> identical<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.080> your<00:01:26.380> PSP<00:01:26.770> power

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
there is identical to your PSP power

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.920 
there is identical to your PSP power
charges<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.420> indeed<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.230> can<00:01:29.530> take<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:30.930> PSP

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
charges and indeed it can take a PSP

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.130 
charges and indeed it can take a PSP
charger<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:33.070> there's<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.970> cable<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.870> say

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
charger so there's the cable now to say

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.440 
charger so there's the cable now to say
let's<00:01:36.040> have<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.250> look<00:01:36.460> at<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.670> charger<00:01:37.090> itself

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
let's have a look at the charger itself

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.220 
let's have a look at the charger itself
it's<00:01:38.100> cuz<00:01:39.100> it's<00:01:39.340> very<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:40.030> nice<00:01:40.270> design<00:01:40.840> and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
it's cuz it's very very nice design and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's cuz it's very very nice design and
like<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:41.920> say<00:01:42.160> venom<00:01:42.610> charger<00:01:43.000> it's<00:01:43.180> got<00:01:43.330> room

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
like I say venom charger it's got room

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.860 
like I say venom charger it's got room
for<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.470> two<00:01:44.710> ps3<00:01:45.100> controllers<00:01:46.030> I'm<00:01:46.750> not

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
for the two ps3 controllers I'm not

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.690 
for the two ps3 controllers I'm not
going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> wire<00:01:47.230> it<00:01:47.260> up<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.650> charge<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> as<00:01:48.580> I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
going to wire it up and charge it as I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to wire it up and charge it as I
say<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.030> just<00:01:49.270> basically<00:01:49.720> an<00:01:50.440> unboxing

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
say this is just basically an unboxing

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.790 
say this is just basically an unboxing
to<00:01:51.250> show<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.730> hardware<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.530> will<00:01:53.770> say

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.160 
to show you the hardware what I will say
guys<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.220> actual<00:01:54.880> base<00:01:55.150> what's<00:01:55.900> going<00:01:56.110> to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
guys the actual base what's going to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.590 
guys the actual base what's going to
look<00:01:56.320> cool<00:01:56.530> about<00:01:56.800> this<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.310> if<00:01:58.120> you<00:01:58.240> plug<00:01:58.450> your

look cool about this is if you plug your

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.010 
look cool about this is if you plug your
charger<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:59.310> it's<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.550> be<00:02:00.700> blue<00:02:01.450> round

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
charger in it's going to be blue round

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.390 
charger in it's going to be blue round
the<00:02:02.170> bottom<00:02:02.500> here<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.980> see<00:02:03.010> it's<00:02:03.280> been<00:02:03.370> a
