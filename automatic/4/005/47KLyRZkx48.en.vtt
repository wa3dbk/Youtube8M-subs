00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
see how he does why character-wise i

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.540 
see how he does why character-wise i
really<00:00:23.699> don't<00:00:23.939> help<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.949> these<00:00:25.949> characters<00:00:26.519> are

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
really don't help I these characters are

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.570 
really don't help I these characters are
both<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.180> little<00:00:27.660> bit<00:00:27.750> subpar<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.890> think

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
both a little bit subpar I think I think

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.479 
both a little bit subpar I think I think
rockin<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.960> bit<00:00:31.050> worse<00:00:31.489> muckerman

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
rockin a is a little bit worse muckerman

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
rockin a is a little bit worse muckerman
has<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> course<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.630> evo<00:00:33.960> recently<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.620> don't

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
has of course one evo recently I don't

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.770 
has of course one evo recently I don't
think<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> rockin<00:00:36.059> has<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.390> done<00:00:36.510> anything

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
think a rockin has really done anything

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590 
think a rockin has really done anything
spectacular<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.559> any<00:00:37.680> big<00:00:37.890> event<00:00:38.480> which<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
spectacular at any big event which is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
spectacular at any big event which is
ironic<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.020> everyone<00:00:40.590> expected<00:00:40.980> rockin

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
ironic because everyone expected rockin

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
ironic because everyone expected rockin
to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:41.850> good<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to be really really good to know what I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.060 
to be really really good to know what I
think<00:00:42.930> albergue<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.469> may<00:00:43.620> prove<00:00:43.770> us<00:00:43.920> wrong

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
think albergue I may prove us wrong

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.600 
think albergue I may prove us wrong
actually<00:00:44.489> maybe<00:00:45.000> he's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> good<00:00:45.870> player<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.980> he

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
actually maybe he's a good player and he

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.889 
actually maybe he's a good player and he
does<00:00:47.789> solve<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> character<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> lot

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
does solve it to the character in a lot

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.000 
does solve it to the character in a lot
of<00:00:48.930> ways<00:00:50.300> good<00:00:51.300> mix<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.559> too<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of ways good mix up just too much the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.170 
of ways good mix up just too much the
block<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.730> controversial

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
block that was a very controversial

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
block that was a very controversial
combo<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.780> overhead<00:00:58.340> can't<00:00:59.340> confirm<00:00:59.550> into

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
combo good overhead can't confirm into

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.220 
combo good overhead can't confirm into
anything<00:01:00.000> though<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> meter

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
anything though there's a lot of meter

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
anything though there's a lot of meter
on<00:01:01.350> his<00:01:01.440> hands<00:01:02.120> nice<00:01:03.120> confirm<00:01:03.480> f<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> G<00:01:03.960> takes

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
on his hands nice confirm f of G takes

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
on his hands nice confirm f of G takes
the<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.309> round<00:01:05.689> convincingly<00:01:06.689> beneath

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the first round convincingly beneath

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
the first round convincingly beneath
trying<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.610> clothing<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.210> is

pressure<00:02:18.459> that's<00:02:18.850> right<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:20.050> at<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.170> same

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
pressure that's right but at the same

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.540
