 salt and pepper to taste 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.320
 I add two thirds of a teaspoon of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.780
 salt and half a teaspoon of pepper 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.060
 ground well mix the butter for 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.950

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 until you're ready to use it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.380
 Now let's prepare a mixture for 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.630
 season the chicken in a bowl combine in 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.780
 teaspoon ground pepper almost almost 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.270
 I forgot to add a spoonful of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.250
 powdered chicken consommé I am using 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.740

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 spoonful mix everything well and reserve 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.620
 for a moment 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.840
 now let's prepare the chicken 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.180
 remember that it is very important that you 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.250
 wash your hands before and after touching 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.070
 any type of meat to avoid 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.200
 contamination with a knife we ​​are going to 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.960
 create an opening on one side 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.300
 of chicken breast but uncut 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.910
 the breast completely 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.250
 you want to achieve an opening or crack 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.420
 that it sinks but does not cross the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.420
 breast completely 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 since you've worked the breasts of 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.730
 chicken transfers the highs are with the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.070
 mix of garlic and cilantro let's 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.520
 massage or rub the chicken very well with 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.830
 this mixture of dry ingredients 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.410
 make sure you rub the chicken well 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.290
 all sides without forgetting the interior of 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.060
 the crack that we create in him since the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.040
 Chicken is well seasoned with the mixture 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.800
 of the dry ingredients it takes a little 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.140
 of about half butter 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.120
 spoonful and fill the opening that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.670
 did you make chicken breast with this 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.380
 butter apart from giving it a lot of flavor 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.690
 the butter inside the breast 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.270
 will allow the chicken to be juicy and not 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.580
 dry when cooked now take a little 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.220
 more than about butter 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.920
 another half a tablespoon and rub on the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.660
 rest of the breast and that's it 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.580
 repeat these steps until you have 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.710
 all chicken breasts stuffed with 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.330
 the butter and also the beech 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.240
 rubbed with a little butter 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.640
 leftover since you have the breasts 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.430
 ready now you are going to wrap them in paper 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.049
 aluminum or waxed paper takes a piece 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.270
 aluminum foil enough 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.990
 Great for wrapping chicken breast 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.910
 and join the tips of the paper 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.880
 so that the chicken is trapped inside 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.700
 of the paper make sure to seal well 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.800
 tips so that steam does not escape 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.310
 and that's all we're going to know in the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.160
 steamer for 25 or 30 minutes or if 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.040
 you prefer you can bake the chicken to 375 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.210
 degrees fahrenheit for 30 minutes or until 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.210
 that is well cooked 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.509
 cover the steamer and let the chicken cook 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.330
 for about 25 or 30 minutes or until 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.819
 is well cooked 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.220
 here my chicken is ready, I just 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.599
 get out of the steamer and now I'm going to 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.599
 serve brown rice 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.680
 I'm going to remove the chicken from the paper 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.320
 aluminum and I'll place it next to 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.010
 rice and I'm going to bathe the chicken with the 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.080
 liquid that remained in the aluminum foil 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.210
 This liquid is delicious and will give you 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.820
 very much flavor to the chicken so do not 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.100
 you waste your chicken with it 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.170
 I will also serve my chicken with 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.630
 whole peas and carrots that 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.340
 they steam together with the chicken but 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.520
 If you prefer, you can serve with your 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.900
 favorite pasta or with mashed potatoes and that 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.240
 It's all good advantage 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.130
