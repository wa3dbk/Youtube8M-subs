00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 now again new aua will be healthy forever 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.849
 Today I would like to us all 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.710
 special talk about sprouts 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 they belong to one of the name brazen 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.260
 food at all and indeed one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 I recommend healthy food 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 definitely sprouts every day 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.730
 Here I have to rebuild as 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.800
 example sprouts also taste good 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.170
 radieschen superlecker to find out what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.170
 you can still shoot sprouts 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.239
 chickpeas so you can pretty much 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 let all sprouts 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.210
 about cereal legumes seeds goes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.399
 everything possible 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:00.359
 or you could even patch through such 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:03.690
 for example wheat or me 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 I have already tried flaxseed here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.360
 Seeds or lonely and also very good 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.159
 made with this patch how to catch 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 on 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.880
 first, the seeds or what 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 also soaked overnight at night 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 best it comes on a larger as 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.619
 Eg the chickpeas need something 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.439
 I would really at least longer 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 twelve hours holiday in water 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.360
 soak them and then if you can 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.070
 I would soak these two times 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.950
 play daily best once 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 happy and once in the evening 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 There are very different variants 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.310
 that here I find the easiest to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 this device is not a vessel that you can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.130
 You can also make your own 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:05.790
 drain water and us again 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:08.670
 out for green as here should be a part 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.030
 of course no holes below 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 be the shell better suited 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.989
 but of course you can just as well 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.010
 take a normal bowl and the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.220
 then intensively as for example with things 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.069
 chickpeas take as long 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.209
 need now about two days 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:34.560
 actually, most of them are 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.569
 Most countries already ready to eat like that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.430
 At the now live I would be the shell 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's not so wholesome 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.950
 which I find or are very good 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 buckwheat but dj sprouted their very 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.049
 that's why I would not do that in such a way 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.100
 to make a vessel for example by here 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.610
 it works fine 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.290
 let water in from above and 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.290
 The game he runs out the back
