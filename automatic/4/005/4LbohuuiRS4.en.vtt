00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
the bulk of the work is done ultimately
this<00:01:29.579> means<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:30.329> our<00:01:30.540> attention<00:01:30.720> to

this means we can put our attention to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
this means we can put our attention to
adding<00:01:31.439> modules<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.070> developing<00:01:32.490> the

adding modules and developing the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
adding modules and developing the
software<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> exactly<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
software to make it exactly what you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.980

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
want it to be this happens in two major

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.429 
want it to be this happens in two major
ways<00:01:38.210> firstly<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.869> people<00:01:40.170> need

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
ways firstly different people need

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
ways firstly different people need
different<00:01:40.470> functions<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.579> understand<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
different functions we understand that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
different functions we understand that
so<00:01:42.810> wls<00:01:43.439> develop<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.040> configure<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> system

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so wls develop and configure the system

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.780 
so wls develop and configure the system
to<00:01:45.060> suit<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.219 

secondly<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.180> white<00:01:49.390> label<00:01:49.570> model<00:01:50.020> means

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
secondly the white label model means

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.469 
secondly the white label model means
your<00:01:50.500> system<00:01:50.950> should<00:01:51.070> look<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.579> your<00:01:52.000> system

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
your system should look like your system

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.399 
your system should look like your system

by<00:01:56.409> rebranding<00:01:57.100> we<00:01:57.189> don't<00:01:57.430> just<00:01:57.580> mean

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
by rebranding we don't just mean

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.030 
by rebranding we don't just mean
swapping<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.299> logo<00:01:58.630> over<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.229> mean<00:01:59.409> creating<00:01:59.920> a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
swapping a logo over we mean creating a

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.800 
swapping a logo over we mean creating a
