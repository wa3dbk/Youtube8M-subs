00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
your web app it works a lot better

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.289 
your web app it works a lot better
because<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> web<00:01:29.250> app<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.579> sometimes<00:01:30.060> goes

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
because on the web app is sometimes goes

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
because on the web app is sometimes goes
to<00:01:30.509> exactly<00:01:30.990> expired<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to exactly expired and that like that it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
to exactly expired and that like that it
says<00:01:34.049> expired<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> makes<00:01:34.890> person<00:01:35.310> think

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
says expired it makes person think

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
says expired it makes person think
they've<00:01:35.729> won<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.240> doesn't<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.720> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they've won it and it doesn't and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.499 
they've won it and it doesn't and then
yeah<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.009> goes<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.369> expired<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
yeah it goes to expired and then it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.030 
yeah it goes to expired and then it
makes<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.840> person<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.530> they've<00:01:40.650> won<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
