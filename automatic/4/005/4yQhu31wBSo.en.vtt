00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.650 
personally don't subscribe to that I
just<00:02:12.770> nip<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.040> up<00:02:13.160> by<00:02:13.310> hand<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.209> needed<00:02:14.569> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
just nip it up by hand if I needed to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.420 
just nip it up by hand if I needed to
use<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> shifter<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.410> undo<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.709> later<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.100> that's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
use a shifter to undo it later on that's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.729 
use a shifter to undo it later on that's
fine<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.620> get<00:02:18.770> our<00:02:18.950> recovery<00:02:19.430> damper<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
fine we then get our recovery damper and

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.860 
fine we then get our recovery damper and
we<00:02:21.860> put<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.190> over<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.610> middle<00:02:22.940> third<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
we put this over the middle third of the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.050 
we put this over the middle third of the
snatch<00:02:24.260> strap<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.739> that's<00:02:25.190> because<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
snatch strap and that's because if the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120 
snatch strap and that's because if the
snatch<00:02:26.330> strap<00:02:26.480> breaks<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.650> whole<00:02:27.830> situation

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
snatch strap breaks the whole situation

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.979 
snatch strap breaks the whole situation
is<00:02:28.730> controlled<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.450> strap<00:02:29.780> will<00:02:29.900> be

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
is controlled and the strap will be

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.720 
is controlled and the strap will be
brought<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> ground<00:02:30.680> nobody<00:02:31.459> gets

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
brought to the ground nobody gets

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
brought to the ground nobody gets
injured

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.900 

on<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.530> rear<00:02:41.710> of<00:02:41.740> Rick's<00:02:42.130> vehicle<00:02:42.520> we're

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
on the rear of Rick's vehicle we're

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.550 
on the rear of Rick's vehicle we're
using<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.330> hitch<00:02:43.510> receiver<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.230> that's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
using a hitch receiver and that's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.410 
using a hitch receiver and that's
because<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.070> safest<00:02:45.580> recovery<00:02:46.150> point

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
because it's the safest recovery point

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.230 
because it's the safest recovery point
the<00:02:47.110> temptation<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.490> use<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> tow<00:02:49.000> ball

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the temptation can be to use a tow ball

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.820 
the temptation can be to use a tow ball
especially<00:02:49.450> when<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.020> all<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.320> bad<00:02:50.650> and

tow ball the golden rule of recovery is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.810 
tow ball the golden rule of recovery is
to<00:02:56.530> use<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.800> safe<00:02:57.600> proven<00:02:58.600> techniques<00:03:02.820> now

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
to use the safe proven techniques now

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.520

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
connected to both the vehicles and the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.880 
connected to both the vehicles and the
recovery<00:03:07.660> damper<00:03:08.170> fitted<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> snatch

strap<00:03:09.010> there's<00:03:09.730> two<00:03:09.940> other<00:03:10.120> things<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.570> be

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
strap there's two other things to be

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.760 
strap there's two other things to be
aware<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.990> firstly<00:03:11.890> lay<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> strap<00:03:13.090> out<00:03:13.770> like

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
aware of firstly lay the strap out like

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.340 
aware of firstly lay the strap out like
this<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.490> that'll<00:03:16.120> give<00:03:16.300> us<00:03:16.420> enough<00:03:16.720> area<00:03:17.200> in

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
this and that'll give us enough area in

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.380 
this and that'll give us enough area in
the<00:03:17.470> strap<00:03:17.770> so<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.340> when<00:03:18.490> Rick<00:03:18.730> takes<00:03:19.000> off<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
the strap so that when Rick takes off it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.990 
the strap so that when Rick takes off it
creates<00:03:19.780> momentum<00:03:20.640> stretches<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.790> snatch

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
creates momentum stretches the snatch

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.570 
creates momentum stretches the snatch
strap<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:23.050> stores<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.770> kinetic<00:03:24.190> energy

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
strap out that stores the kinetic energy

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.300 
strap out that stores the kinetic energy
which<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.270> what<00:03:25.540> recovers<00:03:26.140> me<00:03:26.350> from<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> bog

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
which is what recovers me from the bog

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.130 
which is what recovers me from the bog
of<00:03:27.730> course<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.209> number<00:03:28.480> one<00:03:28.660> golden<00:03:29.110> rule

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
of course the number one golden rule

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.560 
of course the number one golden rule
with<00:03:29.500> any<00:03:29.740> recovery<00:03:30.160> situation<00:03:30.550> is<00:03:31.150> safety

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
with any recovery situation is safety

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.540 
with any recovery situation is safety
first<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.620> means<00:03:32.740> making<00:03:33.070> sure<00:03:33.370> that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
first and that means making sure that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.490 
first and that means making sure that
there's<00:03:33.760> nobody<00:03:34.240> within<00:03:34.450> cuy<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.200> the
