00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630
 It is for you 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.030
 [applause] 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.539

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.949
 me and on the course today we look at the mouse 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:49.730
 razer imperator questions and answers 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.100
 we have questions we start with the first 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.440
 justified in picking there is no disk with 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:02.469
 drivers 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:06.129
 Consider a complete set of certificate of 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.129
 purchase authenticity 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.179
 product catalog 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.850
 computer manual 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:24.880
 bye mac instruction fast 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:29.330
 installation instruction some cardboard 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.970
 two stickers and a cup stand 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 and I have not found themselves drivers 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.770
 download with internet 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.860
 question number two is it worth flashing the mouse 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.649
 How to do this firmware is necessary so 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.340
 fixes some bathhouses for this 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.979
 need to run the firmware file further 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.590
 disconnect above computer hold 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.530
 simultaneously the right left mouse button and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.470
 scroll then connect mouse 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.739
 device and press enter after which 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.920
 mouse flashing will occur 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:06.440
 question 3 in the comments write that the wire 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.300
 thick mice weakly bending is it true 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.810
 it is in my opinion 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.300
 the wire is enough tom and quite flexible 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 question 4 came true that razer imperator 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.849
 bad slides on the mat compared to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.280
 other mice for example traversal nose 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.260
 she moves slowly enough 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.720
 and this despite the teflon legs 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.710
 the model slides perfectly on the mat 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.450
 goliathus control with which 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.070
 working without interruption question 5 say 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.380
 the mouse is very easy to lift not even 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.930
 holding your thumb just dropping 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.010
 him aside is it let's 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.140
 see for yourself yes it really is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.450
 the sixth question really is 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.420
 the problem is due to the fact that it is already long 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 time goes out of sleep at the very 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.520
 actually no such problem and exit 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.190
 happens fast enough 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.460
 question 7 allows i muscle comfortable 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.270
 play when the resolution of the sensor 5600 depot 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.820
 and let's check in principle with such 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.040
 high resolution you can play the cursor 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.600
 does not break down but the movement turns out 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.030
 too sharp it is better to lower the dp and to 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.920
 1900 at the end of our release I would like to 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.670
 talk about the pros and cons of this 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.340
 models are flaws following make and 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.320
 side glossy inserts this 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.420
 sliding on ordinary rugs 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.230
 Teflon legs list the advantages 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.600
 This model is a great economical 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.790
 form for passed 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.790
 quality laser sensor opportunity 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.810
 depot changes and on the fly and the possibility 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 side button layout settings 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.030
 at the same time the price of the mouse is slightly more expensive than 2000 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.980
 rubles that we have enough 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.270
 finished with questions and answers and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.510
 award mice 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.870
 gold with you was arina move to new 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.870
