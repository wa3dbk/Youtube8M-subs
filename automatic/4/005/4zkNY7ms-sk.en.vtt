00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.739
 first start 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 to expand the concept for a moment 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.129
 everyone began to measure the footprint 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 water and it had already become a standard 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.329
 let's say internationally say 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.920

 to other companies to comply with their 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 commitments to society that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 really makes the difference is when 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.950
 you practice this in your business 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.950
 central then 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 and this kind of initiatives should 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.569
 replicate but whole do they all 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.280
