00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.390 
during the two episodes ah in the end I
had<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.020> hyper<00:05:10.289> edit<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.740> ship<00:05:10.949> into<00:05:11.219> orbit

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
had to hyper edit the ship into orbit

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.529 
had to hyper edit the ship into orbit
around<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.969> moon<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.830> then<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:13.979> broke<00:05:14.539> so

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
around the moon and then that broke so

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.240 
around the moon and then that broke so
the<00:05:15.779> ship<00:05:15.960> was<00:05:16.080> never<00:05:16.289> actually<00:05:16.589> in<00:05:17.009> orbit

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
the ship was never actually in orbit

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.689 
the ship was never actually in orbit
around<00:05:17.339> the<00:05:17.550> moon<00:05:17.580> there<00:05:17.909> i'm<00:05:18.029> afraid<00:05:19.520> if<00:05:20.520> you

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
around the moon there i'm afraid if you

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.149 
around the moon there i'm afraid if you
look<00:05:20.879> at<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.270> shot<00:05:21.539> you<00:05:21.779> can<00:05:22.379> see<00:05:22.439> the<00:05:22.919> ship's

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
look at that shot you can see the ship's

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.550 
look at that shot you can see the ship's
not<00:05:23.849> actually<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.300> next<00:05:24.509> to<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.659> moon<00:05:24.839> that's

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
not actually in next to the moon that's

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.679 
not actually in next to the moon that's
the<00:05:25.830> ship<00:05:26.069> pretending<00:05:26.849> to<00:05:26.999> be<00:05:27.120> next<00:05:27.389> to<00:05:27.509> the

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
the ship pretending to be next to the

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.939 
the ship pretending to be next to the
moon<00:05:27.900> actually<00:05:28.529> the<00:05:29.009> ship's<00:05:29.310> just<00:05:29.610> in<00:05:29.759> space

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
moon actually the ship's just in space

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.230 
moon actually the ship's just in space
because<00:05:31.949> case<00:05:32.400> he<00:05:32.580> wouldn't<00:05:32.849> let<00:05:32.939> me<00:05:33.000> go<00:05:33.089> to

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
because case he wouldn't let me go to

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.390 
because case he wouldn't let me go to
the<00:05:33.389> moon<00:05:33.569> and<00:05:33.689> back<00:05:34.159> because<00:05:35.159> every<00:05:35.279> time

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
the moon and back because every time

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.679 
the moon and back because every time
tried<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:35.789> get<00:05:35.909> the<00:05:36.000> moon<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.240> would<00:05:36.300> change<00:05:36.479> my

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
tried to get the moon it would change my

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.110 
tried to get the moon it would change my
orbit<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.740> every<00:05:37.919> time<00:05:38.129> I<00:05:38.430> hybrid<00:05:38.819> hood<00:05:39.000> to

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
orbit and every time I hybrid hood to

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.719 
orbit and every time I hybrid hood to
the<00:05:39.210> moon<00:05:39.469> this<00:05:40.469> ship<00:05:40.680> would<00:05:40.770> float<00:05:41.009> away<00:05:43.729> and

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
the moon this ship would float away and

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.579 
the moon this ship would float away and
also<00:05:44.879> I<00:05:45.330> didn't<00:05:45.810> solve<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.110> problem<00:05:46.439> of<00:05:46.469> the

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:46.589 
also I didn't solve the problem of the

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.510 
also I didn't solve the problem of the
wibbly-wobbly<00:05:46.949> spacecraft<00:05:47.849> of<00:05:47.969> doom<00:05:49.520> the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
wibbly-wobbly spacecraft of doom the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.879 
wibbly-wobbly spacecraft of doom the
shot<00:05:51.210> you<00:05:51.360> see<00:05:51.539> of<00:05:51.629> that<00:05:51.779> in<00:05:51.990> episode<00:05:52.439> 10<00:05:52.620> is

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
shot you see of that in episode 10 is

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.040 
shot you see of that in episode 10 is
actually<00:05:53.729> like<00:05:53.879> the<00:05:54.089> last<00:05:54.300> couple<00:05:54.629> of<00:05:54.839> frames

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
actually like the last couple of frames

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.629 
actually like the last couple of frames
before<00:05:55.379> it<00:05:55.589> goes<00:05:55.710> wiggling<00:05:56.099> wobbling<00:05:56.430> the

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
before it goes wiggling wobbling the

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.730 
before it goes wiggling wobbling the
command<00:05:56.969> pod<00:05:57.539> comes<00:05:57.779> off<00:05:57.960> just<00:05:58.529> played

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
command pod comes off just played

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.260 
command pod comes off just played
backwards<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.430> forwards<00:05:59.729> over<00:05:59.819> and<00:06:00.060> over<00:06:00.120> and

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
backwards and forwards over and over and

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.350 
backwards and forwards over and over and
over<00:06:00.360> again<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.680> yeah<00:06:01.879> sometimes<00:06:02.879> carry

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
over again so yeah sometimes carry

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.969 
over again so yeah sometimes carry
breaks<00:06:03.689> and<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.139> fix<00:06:04.319> it<00:06:04.469> and<00:06:04.589> sometimes

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
breaks and you fix it and sometimes

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.429 
breaks and you fix it and sometimes
carefully<00:06:05.610> breaks<00:06:05.879> and<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.930> tear<00:06:07.139> your<00:06:07.229> hair

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
carefully breaks and you tear your hair

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.540 
carefully breaks and you tear your hair
out<00:06:07.469> and<00:06:07.919> then<00:06:08.759> faked<00:06:09.120> everything<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.979> love<00:06:10.979> kst

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
out and then faked everything I love kst

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.939 
out and then faked everything I love kst
