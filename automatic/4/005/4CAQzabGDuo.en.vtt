00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.559
 hello youtube friends below 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.150
 I will teach you a small tutorial for 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:10.809
 make a ninja star 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.380
 let's see how it works well 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.960
 we need are two halves of square 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.930
 of paper for this can use a 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.110
 only square will be the same color or 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.690
 They can use half of different color 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:30.970
 The first thing we will do is to fold it 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.970
 in half this way 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.320
 we will double the other way 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.800
 and we will fold in half 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.859
 now this 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.940
 well we unfolded and then what 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.989
 we will do it is very important 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.430
 we will fold it in this direction and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.000
 we press and this other we will double it in 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 Wrong Way 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.140
 well now we take the other side 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.390
 in this way 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.909
 we turn around and we'll take this tip here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 forming a triangle and this triangle 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.250
 we'll put it in on the other side 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 we carry this tip 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.980
 and we will put the triangle 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.140
 well let 's leave it aside and 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.400
 we continue with this other we double 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.400
 towards the other direction 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.580
 we turn around and carry this tip to this 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.330
 place 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.330
 we put 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 we do the other side 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.700
 until you get two figures like these 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.320
 well then the following is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.490
 join them 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.980
 if we unfolded them 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.310
 and turn around we will see that we have a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.420
 triangle 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.420
 for this part 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.580
 bolt we will do you in the same way this 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.560
 here we have a zeta and from this side 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.380
 we have a well what we will do will be to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.590
 then flip the side of the s 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.710
 and leave her in this position and the zeta the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.030
 we will put over 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.040
 what we will do is put this point 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.040
 about inside this triangle 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.060
 thus 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.920
 well and we will put this other point 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.940
 in this position 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.300
 so we turn around and do exactly what 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.600
 same as we can see we have a 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:25.390
 cut and we introduce 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.390
 and we introduce from the other side 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.640
 thus 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.480
 good friends and this way we have 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.569
 our ninja star we can occupy 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.340
 to entertain us or only 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.659
 hanging it as an ornament I hope you 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.030
 have liked the video do not forget
