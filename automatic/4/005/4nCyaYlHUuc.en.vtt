 Simons and today on the agenda we have 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.590
 training video 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.330
 we all already know about the upcoming or already 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.580
 entered force lock torrent 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.890
 trackers for some it's like a knife in 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.050
 heart how can we swing our loved ones now 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.120
 games music and movies but on the website rutor 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.880
 dot org an article was written about how 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.460
 get around these same locks and today he 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080
 I consider these methods by the way in the description you 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 You can already find me saved 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.250
 page with this instruction and with all 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.410
 links who are interested go to 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.020
 my site is by reference in the description and so 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.720
 The first about top recommends using 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.960
 his mirror is a mirror rutor.org 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.420
 evri rutor.org what do i think about it i 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.180
 I think and that this method is not the most 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.390
 reliable as these sites could too 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.240
 already get on vr lock but if you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 Watch this video later May 1st and this one 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.300
 the way you work 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.310
 please write comments to others 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 it will be very useful to people as 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 This method is the easiest and most reliable. 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.039
 just go to the site and sit on 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.500
 the same ture 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.600
 the second rutor is recommended to use 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.190
 custom browser settings without 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.830
 stopping any programs and 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.690
 extensions go to my saved 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.690
 page and click on the link in the second 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.240
 read and consider it to be very 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.360
 convenient and useful way, and it works 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.090
 in any case, the third rotor offers 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
 download us the torus browser and go to them 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.720
 to the site through 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.890
 anyone link here is this way i 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.709
 I recommend you 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.600
 it is free simple and fast you 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.700
 Download yourself only to the browser from 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.230
 fake stove maker somewhere in germany 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.660
 you go to this site 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 fourth method is almost the same as 3 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.560
 only here we are offered to download 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.900
 slightly different browser refuel ebay 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.590
 which is based on firefox 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 portable 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 with built-in top clients and proxies 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.550
 Foxy Proxy Supplement 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.010
 quite recommend it by the way too 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.440
 I will remind again that you link to the article 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.150
 can find in the description under this video 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.640
 The fifth way suggests us to establish 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.760
 Expansion I will immediately say that it is unreliable 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.860
 as it can also be blocked 6 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.510
 way but quite some kind of strange to us 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.180
 suggest to turn turbo mode into 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.989
 browsers opera or yandex browser does not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.160
 I recommend from 7 to 10 we advise 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.650
 various articles 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.120
 I advise you to read them too, because 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.910
 You will be told about various options. 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 change gateway proxy ip and so on 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.190
 very helpful can help if you have 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.380
 other methods do not work 11 article 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.510
 this is bypassing locks here 1 com freedom 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.670
 Here are the various ways that 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.280
 already worked when locking various 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.670
 Russia sites in their list and browser tor 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.810
 which I recommend to you but 12 way 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.209
 this is for advanced 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.860
 IT specialists I have already studied this method and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.140
 I can say with confidence that this 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.780
 way you will work if you have 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.970
 even hands if you have hands 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.989
 slightly crooked you can lose 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.639
