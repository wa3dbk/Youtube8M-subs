00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.529
 I'm going to present to you the new way of 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.410
 cut ham I'm saving the volume 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.900
 within guard for cutting 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.330
 ham the reason for inventing this 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.699
 project arises from accidents that 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.250
 there is cutting ham all that is not a 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.980
 specialist wants to cut short ham 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.080
 ham but it got injured because we did not 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.830
 let's feed it because if we 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.740
 we put to cut and we miss the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.660
 knife the protector will be before 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.960
 that the knife with which the accident 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.100
 that there are more than 50 in all the years that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.649
 we have avoided that is the point of view 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.170
 the most important the next which is 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.030
 the ham say you have to eat it in 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.030
 thin and unhurried slices 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.129
 we can continue cutting up 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.280
 to finish the welt or to do the length 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.079
 that we want the slice the knife should 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.100
 to always be supporting a plane 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.559
 about ham 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.200
 once the early one is to continue towards 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.860
 forward move it if we were 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.860
 trying 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.030
 and the fight to keep coming out final 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.460
 until reporting after the first 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.250
 prototype of this knife 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.409
 is this piece of which mind new idea 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.590
 I said we will have been able to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.220
 do something that being at the different level 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.150
 the blade guard can work 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.490
 this piece we say 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.490
 but here the measures do not come but 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.560
 what we wanted to do, I did it because 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.680
 he was always going to give us the protector before 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.630
 that the sheet with which we passed to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 realize what is in the market what 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.580
 that you can use because 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.930
 is the protector for ham cultivation 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.220
 we have thought about the juices because 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.020
 first because I had less 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 percentage also has a right but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.800
 there is 10% of the bam has nothing more 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 more than flipping the knife and the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.420
 left handed 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.960
 boil the ham the same with the same 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.700
 protection to us the test of fire 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.070
 before the first to leave at 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.770
 market seeing that it worked in a 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.960
 person 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.590
 with the attitudes of any of 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.620
 we then went to the collective 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.540
 less favored than the risks are A 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.710
 blind who can hire them without risk 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 of getting injured 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.870
 for us it was in the cornerstone 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.640
 we did the first championship through 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.730
 of the advance and the truth is that it was a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.730
 success because he knew by closed 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.480
 they may be carrying ham and 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.550
 although they are not cut off escape the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.550
 true that it was a success and inside
