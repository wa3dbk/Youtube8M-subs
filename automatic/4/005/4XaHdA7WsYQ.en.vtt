and stuff like that and then on the
bottom<00:01:57.909> right<00:01:58.240> side<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.659> actually<00:01:59.079> see<00:01:59.380> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
bottom right side you actually see the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.859 
bottom right side you actually see the
kind<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.369> icon<00:02:00.849> that<00:02:01.029> says<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.389> you<00:02:01.479> have<00:02:01.509> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
tomahawk and that you're able to use it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.440 
tomahawk and that you're able to use it
another<00:02:06.189> thing<00:02:06.429> that<00:02:06.459> I<00:02:06.579> noticed<00:02:06.969> was<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.119> as

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
another thing that I noticed was that as

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.089 
another thing that I noticed was that as
it<00:02:07.599> was<00:02:07.749> coming<00:02:07.899> back<00:02:08.229> like<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> boomerang<00:02:08.740> it

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
it was coming back like a boomerang it

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.889 
it was coming back like a boomerang it
actually<00:02:09.490> picked<00:02:09.789> up<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> nuke<00:02:10.420> off<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
actually picked up the nuke off the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.900 
actually picked up the nuke off the
floor<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.380> actually<00:02:12.190> brought<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.849> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
floor and actually brought it back to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.580 
floor and actually brought it back to
you<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.810> looks<00:02:14.020> like<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.470> be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
you so this looks like it's going to be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.530 
you so this looks like it's going to be
a<00:02:14.620> really<00:02:14.950> useful<00:02:14.980> tomahawk<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.330> looks<00:02:16.510> like

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
a really useful tomahawk it looks like

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.449 
a really useful tomahawk it looks like
can<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.930> able<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.200> use<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.650> for

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
can you be able to use it so for

people you know they they kind of run

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.660 
people you know they they kind of run
away<00:02:33.440> from<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.920> lose<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> power<00:02:34.430> up

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
get it and get killed so this is going

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.070 
get it and get killed so this is going
to<00:02:38.330> be<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> those<00:02:38.660> things<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:38.870> really

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080

convenient so if you notice that you
drop<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> powerup<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.480> don't<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.870> time

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
drop a powerup and you don't have time

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.270 
drop a powerup and you don't have time
