to<00:00:43.700> control<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.600> work<00:00:44.840> that<00:00:45.350> would<00:00:45.470> mean

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
to control to work that would mean

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.110 
to control to work that would mean
perhaps<00:00:45.860> running<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.250> little<00:00:46.370> softer<00:00:46.880> than<00:00:47.000> you

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
perhaps running a little softer than you

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.540 
perhaps running a little softer than you
normally<00:00:47.270> would<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:47.660> if<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.620> curve<00:00:48.860> doesn't

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
normally would so if the curve doesn't

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.910 
normally would so if the curve doesn't
just<00:00:49.850> bounce<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.600> know<00:00:50.720> just<00:00:51.050> rides<00:00:51.680> it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
just bounce you know just rides it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.770 
just bounce you know just rides it
there's<00:00:52.580> not<00:00:52.730> not<00:00:53.030> many<00:00:53.210> straight<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:53.750> we

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
there's not not many straight so we

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.240 
there's not not many straight so we
don't<00:00:54.020> even<00:00:54.140> get<00:00:54.350> into<00:00:55.180> sixth<00:00:56.180> gear<00:00:56.210> at<00:00:56.480> all

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250

up<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.510> down<00:00:59.600> we<00:00:59.720> had<00:00:59.750> some<00:01:00.050> rain<00:01:00.260> towards<00:01:00.860> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
up and down we had some rain towards the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.450 
up and down we had some rain towards the
end<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.250> FB<00:01:02.180> too<00:01:02.360> so<00:01:02.750> but<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.710> went<00:01:03.890> went<00:01:04.309> well

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
end of FB too so but that went went well

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.030 
end of FB too so but that went went well
as<00:01:04.580> always<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.030> rain<00:01:05.619> we<00:01:06.619> are<00:01:06.740> good<00:01:06.950> on

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
as always in the rain we are good on

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.219 
as always in the rain we are good on
breaks<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.390> really<00:01:08.659> wanted<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:08.990> hot

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
breaks but we really wanted the hot

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.860 
breaks but we really wanted the hot
weather<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.250> get<00:01:10.369> that<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:11.030> that's<00:01:11.360> small

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870

tool you're in big big trouble as we saw
with<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.409> car<00:01:24.190> here<00:01:24.430> wet<00:01:24.729> went<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.450> last

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
with a car here wet went on the last

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.499 
with a car here wet went on the last
corner<00:01:26.530> which<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.310> second<00:01:27.790> gear<00:01:27.940> corner<00:01:28.360> and

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
corner which is a second gear corner and

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.990 
corner which is a second gear corner and
he<00:01:28.570> looks<00:01:29.110> like<00:01:29.200> he's<00:01:29.520> written<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.610> car<00:01:30.790> off

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
he looks like he's written the car off

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.359 
he looks like he's written the car off
we<00:01:31.930> thought<00:01:32.080> maybe<00:01:32.229> we'd<00:01:32.590> struggle<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:33.009> bit<00:01:33.039> but

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
we thought maybe we'd struggle a bit but

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.219 
we thought maybe we'd struggle a bit but
now<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.580> see<00:01:33.729> we<00:01:34.000> seem<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.509> be<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.720> place<00:01:34.899> so

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
now we see we seem to be on the place so

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.350 
now we see we seem to be on the place so
ya<00:01:36.159> think<00:01:36.280> some<00:01:36.580> things<00:01:36.610> are<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.000> good<00:01:37.270> for

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
ya think some things are really good for

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
ya think some things are really good for
the<00:01:37.450> weekend

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.590 

a<00:01:46.900> big<00:01:47.900> long<00:01:48.380> fight<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:49.040> an<00:01:49.250> Audi<00:01:49.460> was<00:01:50.240> coming
