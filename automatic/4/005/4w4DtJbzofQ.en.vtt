why I'm doing it along the way it's not
one<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> those<00:00:31.410> fast-forward<00:00:32.160> videos<00:00:32.940> i

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
one of those fast-forward videos i

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.560 
one of those fast-forward videos i
freakin<00:00:34.290> hate<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:34.829> artists<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.790> so

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
freakin hate it when artists do that so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.220 
freakin hate it when artists do that so
you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.530> real<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.809> little

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you know this is real time but a little

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
you know this is real time but a little
bit<00:00:40.320> faster<00:00:40.770> pace<00:00:40.980> maybe<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.329> less

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
bit faster pace maybe a little less

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.170 
bit faster pace maybe a little less

explaining so mainly a lot of the stuff
that<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.420> doing<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:46.129> got<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that I'm doing is got to do with a lot

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
that I'm doing is got to do with a lot
of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> stuff<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> I've<00:00:48.690> done<00:00:48.870> before<00:00:49.079> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
of the stuff that I've done before so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
of the stuff that I've done before so
when<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> come<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> little

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
when I come to something that's a little

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.979 
when I come to something that's a little
odd<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.199> will<00:00:52.500> explain<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.539> ok<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
odd I will explain it ok so I'm going to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.569 
odd I will explain it ok so I'm going to
start<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.710> basic<00:00:56.039> shape<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
start out with the basic shape of a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.170 
start out with the basic shape of a
handle<00:00:57.030> ok<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:59.180> in

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
handle ok and then go on from there in

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.450 
handle ok and then go on from there in
what<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> choose<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.649> handle<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.280> how

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
what you choose for your handle or how

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.020 
what you choose for your handle or how
thick<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.210> wide<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:08.030> I'm

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
thick or how wide that's up to you I'm

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
thick or how wide that's up to you I'm
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> cap<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.900> decide<00:01:15.900> how<00:01:16.080> thick

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
going to do the cap and decide how thick

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.390 
going to do the cap and decide how thick
the<00:01:16.470> blades<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.830> extrude

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the blades going to be now I can extrude

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
the blades going to be now I can extrude
it<00:01:23.750> think<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:24.869> long<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> blade<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it think how long the blade is going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.090 
it think how long the blade is going to
be<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.570> top<00:01:27.630> view<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.380> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:28.950> at

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
be in my top view I can kind of look at

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
be in my top view I can kind of look at
this<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.670> an<00:01:29.790> understanding<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this and get an understanding of you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440 
this and get an understanding of you
know<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.229> shape<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> blade<00:01:32.420> what<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
know maybe shape of the blade what I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.480 
know maybe shape of the blade what I
could<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.140> grab<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> vertices<00:01:35.130> on

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
could do here is grab the vertices on

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.749 
could do here is grab the vertices on
this<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> scale<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.400> just

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this and then take the scale and just

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.929 
this and then take the scale and just
scale<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.799> wanted<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> come<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
scale it in and if I wanted to come to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.810 
scale it in and if I wanted to come to
an<00:01:42.060> absolute<00:01:42.329> point<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.990> could<00:01:43.490> let<00:01:44.490> me<00:01:44.579> put

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
an absolute point I could let me put

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.310 
an absolute point I could let me put
this<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> six<00:01:45.390> mode<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.140> see

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this in six mode so you can actually see

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
this in six mode so you can actually see
what<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:46.740> doing<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
what I'm doing but what I want to do is

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160 
what I'm doing but what I want to do is
insert<00:01:49.530> an<00:01:49.680> edge<00:01:49.829> loop<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.240> then

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
insert an edge loop right here and then

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
insert an edge loop right here and then
scale<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.220> red<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.570> an

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
scale it in red and I can kind of get an

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
scale it in red and I can kind of get an
idea<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.219> now

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
idea what that's going to look like now

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.969 
idea what that's going to look like now
keep<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> mind<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.680> rough

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
keep in mind this is going to be rough

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
keep in mind this is going to be rough
for<00:02:02.040> quite<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.479> model<00:02:03.990> rough<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
for quite some time I model rough and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.459 
for quite some time I model rough and
then<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.430> along<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.060> hit<00:02:06.750> three<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
then as I go along I hit three on the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.360 
then as I go along I hit three on the
keyboard<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:09.110> kind<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
keyboard to kind of get this

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.610 
keyboard to kind of get this
okay<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> while<00:02:14.049> it's<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:14.500> look

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
okay so for a while it's going to look

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.860 
okay so for a while it's going to look
really<00:02:14.650> rough<00:02:16.080> ok<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.409> handle<00:02:18.209> well<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
really rough ok now the handle well the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
really rough ok now the handle well the
handle<00:02:20.170> would<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.500> gripped<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.730> area

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
handle would have gripped in this area

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.420 
handle would have gripped in this area
and<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> would<00:02:22.629> have<00:02:22.810> some<00:02:23.049> area<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.650> here<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and it would have some area in here to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.699 
and it would have some area in here to
prevent<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.269> hand<00:02:25.720> from<00:02:25.930> slipping<00:02:26.349> onto<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
prevent the hand from slipping onto the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.949 
prevent the hand from slipping onto the
blade<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.970> how<00:02:28.150> would<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.480> something<00:02:28.780> like

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
blade so how would I do something like

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.949 
blade so how would I do something like
that<00:02:29.730> I'd<00:02:30.730> probably<00:02:30.790> insert<00:02:31.480> an<00:02:31.629> edge<00:02:31.750> loop

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
that I'd probably insert an edge loop

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.210 
that I'd probably insert an edge loop
here<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:34.920> ok<00:02:36.989> then<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.290> will<00:02:38.530> take<00:02:38.890> this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
here and here ok then I will take this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.289 
here and here ok then I will take this
and<00:02:39.519> switch<00:02:40.360> over<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.690> faces<00:02:45.000> grab<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
and switch over to faces grab all the

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.660 
and switch over to faces grab all the
faces<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.930> area<00:02:47.200> extrude<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.220> then

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
faces in the area extrude and then

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.369 
faces in the area extrude and then
switch<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.480> different<00:02:49.870> view<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
switch over to a different view to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.759 
switch over to a different view to
extrude<00:02:51.040> them<00:02:51.250> out<00:02:53.400> ok<00:02:55.410> again<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:56.650> do

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
extrude them out ok again I would do

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:06.630 
extrude them out ok again I would do
that<00:02:56.799> on<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.120> too<00:03:03.510> ok<00:03:04.510> now<00:03:05.500> i<00:03:05.829> can<00:03:06.430> jump

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that on this one too ok now i can jump

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.630 
that on this one too ok now i can jump
into<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:07.000> different<00:03:07.390> view<00:03:07.629> now<00:03:08.310> mainly<00:03:09.310> this

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
into a different view now mainly this

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.509 
into a different view now mainly this
video<00:03:09.879> is<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.180> change<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:11.019> know<00:03:11.519> kind

of your outlook towards using views
views<00:03:16.599> i<00:03:16.840> didn't<00:03:17.230> utilize<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:17.980> past<00:03:18.359> but

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
views i didn't utilize in the past but

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.509 
views i didn't utilize in the past but
now<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.989> see<00:03:20.169> if<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> don't<00:03:20.739> use<00:03:20.950> utilize

looks like a weird little dagger letter

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.930 
looks like a weird little dagger letter
opener<00:03:34.959> thing<00:03:35.169> so<00:03:35.950> now<00:03:36.099> it's<00:03:36.280> time<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.639> tighten

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
opener thing so now it's time to tighten

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.189 
opener thing so now it's time to tighten
up<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.389> design<00:03:37.780> quite<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.139> bit<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.930> what<00:03:41.109> I'm

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
up the design quite a bit so what I'm

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.400 
up the design quite a bit so what I'm
going<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.349> do<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:41.859> insert<00:03:42.819> an<00:03:42.970> edge<00:03:43.150> loop

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
going to do here is insert an edge loop

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.490 
going to do here is insert an edge loop
along<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.980> blade<00:03:45.599> so<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.690> tightens<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.169> area

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
along the blade so it tightens that area

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:57.809 
along the blade so it tightens that area
right<00:03:48.329> here<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:50.260> right<00:03:51.239> here<00:03:53.730> ok<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.609> go

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
right here and right here ok and then go

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.879 
right here and right here ok and then go
in<00:03:57.940> here<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.329> object<00:03:58.690> mode<00:03:58.720> again<00:03:58.959> hit<00:03:59.530> three

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
in here to object mode again hit three

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.890 
in here to object mode again hit three
and<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.549> can<00:04:00.730> see<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:00.879> tightened<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.599> right

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
and you can see that tightened it right

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.369 
and you can see that tightened it right
up<00:04:02.109> now<00:04:02.859> I<00:04:02.919> got<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> clearly<00:04:03.819> defined<00:04:03.970> area<00:04:04.599> so

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
up now I got a clearly defined area so

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.890 
up now I got a clearly defined area so
edge<00:04:05.650> loops<00:04:05.949> are<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.280> key<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:07.120> magic<00:04:07.690> of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
edge loops are the key to the magic of

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.780 
edge loops are the key to the magic of
this<00:04:09.870> ok<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.349> one<00:04:11.799> two<00:04:11.919> three<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.340> keyboard

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
this ok so one two three on the keyboard

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.400 
this ok so one two three on the keyboard
again<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.480> kind<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.690> keep<00:04:13.870> switching<00:04:14.319> between

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
again to kind of keep switching between

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.710 
again to kind of keep switching between
those<00:04:14.769> views<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.609> if<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.180> wanted<00:04:16.359> something

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
those views and if I wanted something

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.420 
those views and if I wanted something
like<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.049> different<00:04:17.470> kind<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.709> blade<00:04:17.949> let's<00:04:18.280> say

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
like a different kind of blade let's say

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.149 
like a different kind of blade let's say
you<00:04:18.760> know<00:04:18.880> maybe<00:04:19.409> just<00:04:20.409> play<00:04:20.590> around<00:04:20.709> with<00:04:21.039> the

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
you know maybe just play around with the

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.490 
you know maybe just play around with the
idea<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.599> maybe<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.780> doesn't<00:04:22.960> have<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.349> be<00:04:23.380> a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
idea of maybe it doesn't have to be a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.800 
idea of maybe it doesn't have to be a
blade<00:04:24.099> that's<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.490> uniformed

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
blade that's so uniformed

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.600 
blade that's so uniformed
I<00:04:25.840> could<00:04:26.020> easily<00:04:26.290> go<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:26.830> here<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.520> of

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
I could easily go in here and kind of
