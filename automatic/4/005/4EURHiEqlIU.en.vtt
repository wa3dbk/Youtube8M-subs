has pulled out all the stops for this

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.800 
has pulled out all the stops for this
car<00:00:25.279> it's<00:00:25.490> just<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.180> well<00:00:26.390> made<00:00:26.779> and

car it's just so well made and
everything<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:27.859> very<00:00:28.189> very<00:00:28.460> well<00:00:28.609> screwed

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
everything it's very very well screwed

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.250 
everything it's very very well screwed
together<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.359> fact<00:00:29.539> I<00:00:29.630> think<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.869> quality<00:00:30.199> in

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
together in fact I think the quality in

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.259 
together in fact I think the quality in
who's<00:00:30.410> just<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:31.099> little<00:00:31.430> bit<00:00:31.550> better<00:00:31.670> than

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
who's just that little bit better than

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.720 
who's just that little bit better than
its<00:00:32.510> German<00:00:32.930> rivals<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.710> also<00:00:33.860> think<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
its German rivals and I also think the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.549 
its German rivals and I also think the
design<00:00:35.090> is<00:00:35.269> better<00:00:35.420> too<00:00:35.720> but<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.290> know<00:00:36.379> don't

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
design is better too but you know don't

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.900

and gearbox in dynamic mode for a faster
aatul<00:02:40.870> response<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.920> car<00:02:42.100> holds<00:02:42.340> on

aatul response and so the car holds on

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.460 
aatul response and so the car holds on
to<00:02:42.519> its<00:02:42.640> gears<00:02:42.880> for<00:02:43.090> longer<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.810> steering<00:02:44.260> is

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
to its gears for longer the steering is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.259 
to its gears for longer the steering is
an<00:02:44.650> automatic<00:02:45.130> mode<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.580> most<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.060> time

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
an automatic mode so most of the time

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.300 
an automatic mode so most of the time
it's<00:02:46.480> nice<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.900> light<00:02:47.080> when<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.680> gain<00:02:47.860> faster

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
it's nice and light when you gain faster

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.759 
it's nice and light when you gain faster
it<00:02:48.580> weights<00:02:49.000> up<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.959> air<00:02:50.049> suspension

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
it weights up and the air suspension

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.500 
it weights up and the air suspension
well<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.310> course<00:02:51.340> yes<00:02:51.850> I've<00:02:52.150> got<00:02:52.360> named

well of course yes I've got named
comfort<00:02:53.049> mode<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.769> just<00:02:53.950> wafts<00:02:54.430> about

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
comfort mode so it just wafts about

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.580 
comfort mode so it just wafts about
however<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.690> does<00:02:55.959> bring<00:02:56.170> me<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.500> this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
however that does bring me on to this

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.350 
however that does bring me on to this
cars<00:02:56.890> downsides<00:02:57.489> because<00:02:57.700> one<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.209> is
