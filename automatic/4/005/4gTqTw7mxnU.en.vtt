so<00:04:26.039> all<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.279> did<00:04:26.460> was<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:26.760> just

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
so all I did was I just

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.020 
so all I did was I just
dabbe<00:04:27.620> some<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.070> off<00:04:28.190> with<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.430> tissue<00:04:28.730> and

dabbe some of it off with a tissue and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.930 
dabbe some of it off with a tissue and
it<00:04:29.990> ended<00:04:30.350> up<00:04:30.500> looking<00:04:30.680> more<00:04:31.100> like<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> stain

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940
