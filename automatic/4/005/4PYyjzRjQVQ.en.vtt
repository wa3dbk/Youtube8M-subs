there's nice sound a little messing
around<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> idea<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
around here but you get the idea this is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.120 
around here but you get the idea this is
the<00:02:03.899> rear<00:02:04.590> speaker<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.810> front<00:02:09.810> right

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the rear speaker this is front right

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.250 
the rear speaker this is front right
Center<00:02:11.400> front<00:02:12.270> left<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.920> over<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:15.260> this

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
Center front left and over here this

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.070 
Center front left and over here this
speaker<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.880> system<00:02:18.330> was<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> little<00:02:18.960> bit

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
speaker for this system was a little bit

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080 
speaker for this system was a little bit
on<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> flaky<00:02:19.680> side<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.100> had<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> reverb<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
on the flaky side it had a reverb to it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.780 
on the flaky side it had a reverb to it
so<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.230> took<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.530> out<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.670> a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
so I took it out and this is just a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.310 
so I took it out and this is just a
stand-in<00:02:24.180> speaker<00:02:24.630> from<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.110> my<00:02:25.200> other

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
stand-in speaker from one of my other

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.470 
stand-in speaker from one of my other
systems<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:28.140> system<00:02:28.530> doesn't<00:02:28.740> come<00:02:29.040> with

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
systems so this system doesn't come with

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.010 
systems so this system doesn't come with
this<00:02:30.480> speaker<00:02:31.580> or<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:33.360> comes<00:02:33.600> with<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> one

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
this speaker or it comes with the one

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.560 
this speaker or it comes with the one
that<00:02:34.110> has<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.290> reverb<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.970> myself

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
that has a reverb on it but like myself

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.600 
that has a reverb on it but like myself
you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.140> replace<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> another

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
you can just replace it with a another

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.970 
you can just replace it with a another
speaker<00:02:39.120> I'd<00:02:39.330> probably<00:02:39.600> go<00:02:39.840> pick<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:41.480> from

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
speaker I'd probably go pick one up from

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
speaker I'd probably go pick one up from
a<00:02:43.980> fish<00:02:44.640> store<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.000> whatnot<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.660> find<00:02:45.900> good

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
a fish store or whatnot if you find good

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.920 
a fish store or whatnot if you find good
quality<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.830> preferably<00:02:47.670> Sony<00:02:47.910> speakers<00:02:48.450> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
