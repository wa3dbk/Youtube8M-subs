00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
turn of events this thought was dropped

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.319 
turn of events this thought was dropped
it<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.350> actually<00:00:42.100> hated<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.730> because<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:43.120> was<00:00:43.300> a

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
it I actually hated it because it was a

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.479 
it I actually hated it because it was a
mess<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:43.750> had<00:00:43.899> no<00:00:44.140> aesthetical<00:00:44.770> value<00:00:45.070> at<00:00:45.250> all

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
mess and had no aesthetical value at all

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.300 
mess and had no aesthetical value at all
it<00:00:46.360> started<00:00:46.809> irritating<00:00:47.440> me<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:48.100> made<00:00:48.280> a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
it started irritating me and I made a

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.640 
it started irritating me and I made a
new<00:00:48.520> sketch<00:00:48.880> saturd<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.780> my<00:00:49.900> photographer<00:00:50.620> and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
new sketch saturd to my photographer and

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.890 
new sketch saturd to my photographer and
eventually<00:00:51.490> it<00:00:51.610> became<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.000> final<00:00:52.270> concept

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
eventually it became the final concept

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.980 
eventually it became the final concept
of<00:00:53.110> my<00:00:53.260> dress<00:00:54.060> before<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.329> continue<00:00:55.810> watching

video is not sponsored I just recorded

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.619 
video is not sponsored I just recorded
all<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> steps<00:01:03.370> which<00:01:03.700> actually<00:01:04.119> wrote<00:01:04.360> for

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
all the steps which actually wrote for

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.640 
all the steps which actually wrote for
me

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.900 

after<00:01:09.650> useless<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> chance<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.520> find<00:01:10.760> the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
after useless a chance to find the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.030 
after useless a chance to find the
perfect<00:01:11.150> fabric<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.900> decided<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.830> make<00:01:13.010> it

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
perfect fabric I decided to make it

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.090 
perfect fabric I decided to make it
myself<00:01:13.480> actually<00:01:14.480> it<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.320> pretty<00:01:15.590> kinky<00:01:15.830> when

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
myself actually it is pretty kinky when

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250 
myself actually it is pretty kinky when
it<00:01:16.190> comes<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.550> dye<00:01:16.730> in<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.060> tinting<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:18.020> I

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
it comes to dye in and tinting so I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.230 
it comes to dye in and tinting so I
experimented<00:01:18.950> with<00:01:19.100> lots<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.730> stuff<00:01:20.000> on<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
experimented with lots of stuff on the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.850 
experimented with lots of stuff on the
remains<00:01:20.540> of<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.810> same<00:01:21.020> fabric<00:01:21.350> just<00:01:21.710> to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
remains of the same fabric just to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.160 
remains of the same fabric just to
observe<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.340> effect

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
observe the effect

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.020 
observe the effect
I<00:01:24.200> even<00:01:24.560> tried<00:01:24.800> using<00:01:25.040> Copic<00:01:25.400> markers<00:01:25.910> and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
I even tried using Copic markers and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.900 
I even tried using Copic markers and
coffee<00:01:27.010> eventually<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.160> figured<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.700> that

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
coffee eventually I figured out that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.490 
coffee eventually I figured out that
what<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.270> colors<00:01:29.570> would<00:01:29.720> give<00:01:29.930> me<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.320> very

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
what the colors would give me that very

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.290 
what the colors would give me that very
kind<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.920> pattern<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.490> initially<00:01:31.970> wanted<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
kind of pattern I initially wanted to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.940 
kind of pattern I initially wanted to
have

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.029 

to<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.850> after<00:01:36.719> dying<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.140> hill<00:01:37.350> three<00:01:37.680> meters

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
to do after dying the hill three meters

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.880 
to do after dying the hill three meters
I<00:01:38.219> got<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:38.820> contouring<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.840> need<00:01:40.560> Giovanna

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
I got down to contouring I need Giovanna

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
I got down to contouring I need Giovanna
textile<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.640> dog<00:01:41.820> fabric<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.420> actually<00:01:42.689> we

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
textile for dog fabric and actually we

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
textile for dog fabric and actually we
have<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> history<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:44.549> been<00:01:44.820> using<00:01:45.060> Johanna

let<00:01:47.429> me<00:01:47.549> down<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.829> decided<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.189> bow<00:01:50.369> knees

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
let me down I decided to have bow knees

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.319 
let me down I decided to have bow knees
on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> dress

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on the dress

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
coping them first on the tracing paper

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.929 
coping them first on the tracing paper
and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.119> started<00:01:54.600> torturing<00:01:54.840> myself

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and then started torturing myself

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.399 
and then started torturing myself
there<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.060> overall<00:01:57.450> four<00:01:57.810> flowers<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.319> the
