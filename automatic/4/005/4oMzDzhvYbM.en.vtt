puzzles<00:01:35.540> form<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.250> go<00:01:37.760> ahead<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:37.940> check<00:01:38.150> that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
puzzles form so go ahead and check that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.870 
puzzles form so go ahead and check that
out<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:39.050> cool<00:01:39.290> thing<00:01:39.530> about<00:01:39.560> this<00:01:40.100> cube<00:01:40.520> is

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
out the cool thing about this cube is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.870 
out the cool thing about this cube is
check<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.540> out<00:01:41.750> turn<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.370> the<00:01:43.370> center<00:01:43.670> layer

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
check this out turn it the center layer

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.219 
check this out turn it the center layer
like<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.650> then<00:01:47.290> what<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.400> is

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
like that and then what you see that is

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.360 
like that and then what you see that is
that<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.409> weirdest-looking<00:01:51.770> thing<00:01:54.190> anyway

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
that the weirdest-looking thing anyway

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.880 
that the weirdest-looking thing anyway
kind<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.760> cool<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:57.640> while<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> was<00:01:59.440> making<00:02:00.440> this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
kind of cool so while I was making this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.130 
kind of cool so while I was making this
puzzle<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.640> videotaped<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.690> whole<00:02:02.720> process

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
puzzle I videotaped the whole process

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.469 
puzzle I videotaped the whole process
thinking<00:02:03.740> maybe<00:02:04.250> I'll<00:02:04.460> make<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.670> tutorial<00:02:04.940> on

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
thinking maybe I'll make a tutorial on

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
thinking maybe I'll make a tutorial on
how<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.780> youtube<00:02:06.590> tutorial<00:02:07.159> on<00:02:07.220> how<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.369> make

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
how to youtube tutorial on how to make

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.580 
how to youtube tutorial on how to make
this<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.869> don't<00:02:09.140> think<00:02:09.229> I'm<00:02:09.349> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> do

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
this but I don't think I'm going to do

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.649 
this but I don't think I'm going to do
that<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:09.979> reason<00:02:10.159> is<00:02:10.489> first<00:02:11.150> off<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.599> don't

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
that and the reason is first off I don't

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.839 
that and the reason is first off I don't
have<00:02:11.840> enough<00:02:12.019> time<00:02:12.319> second<00:02:13.099> there's<00:02:13.580> already

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
have enough time second there's already

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.550 
have enough time second there's already
