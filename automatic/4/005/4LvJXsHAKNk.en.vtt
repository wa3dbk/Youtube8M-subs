00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
know I mean I still wish it was a bit

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
know I mean I still wish it was a bit
better<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.970> holding<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> think

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
better but it's holding up and I think

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.570 
better but it's holding up and I think
it<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.769> important<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it was just important you not to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970 
it was just important you not to
overplay<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> played<00:00:31.800> quite<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
overplay and because I played quite a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
overplay and because I played quite a
few<00:00:32.189> matches<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.820> starting<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> season

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
few matches you know starting the season

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.319 
few matches you know starting the season
so<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.149> rest
