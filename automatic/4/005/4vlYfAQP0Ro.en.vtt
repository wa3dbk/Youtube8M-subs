in the Olympic women's competition
there's<00:00:10.080> four<00:00:10.410> apparatus<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.030> Olympic

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
there's four apparatus and the Olympic

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.509 
there's four apparatus and the Olympic
order<00:00:12.870> they<00:00:13.170> start<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> vault<00:00:13.950> which<00:00:14.370> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
order they start on the vault which is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.150 
order they start on the vault which is
obviously<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.000> 2025<00:00:15.900> meter<00:00:16.260> run<00:00:16.440> down<00:00:16.710> there<00:00:16.980> as

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
obviously a 2025 meter run down there as

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.670 
obviously a 2025 meter run down there as
powerful<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.060> hit<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> top<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.260> off

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
powerful as you can hit the top get off

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.679 
powerful as you can hit the top get off
good<00:00:20.189> London<00:00:20.640> then<00:00:21.359> they've<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
good London then they've got the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.689 
good London then they've got the
asymmetric<00:00:22.199> bars<00:00:22.320> we've<00:00:22.890> got<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> those

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
asymmetric bars we've got two of those

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.670 
asymmetric bars we've got two of those
one<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.510> down<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.529> they've

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
one up here one down here then they've

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.050 
one up here one down here then they've
got<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> beam<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.400> obviously<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
got the beam which obviously is just

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.870 
got the beam which obviously is just
four<00:00:27.359> inches<00:00:27.840> wide<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.949> beam<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
four inches wide on the beam you have to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
four inches wide on the beam you have to
do<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> minimum<00:00:30.660> between<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.830> minute<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> one

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
do a minimum between one minute and one

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.910 
do a minimum between one minute and one
minute<00:00:32.759> 10<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.450> maximum<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.469> minute<00:00:34.680> -

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
minute 10 and a maximum of one minute -

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
minute 10 and a maximum of one minute -
one<00:00:35.070> minute<00:00:35.100> 30<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.719> bars<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> beam

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
one minute 30 on the bars and the beam

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.160 
one minute 30 on the bars and the beam
there's<00:00:38.280> eight<00:00:38.550> elements<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.629> must<00:00:39.930> do

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there's eight elements that you must do

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
there's eight elements that you must do
and<00:00:40.469> then<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> highest<00:00:41.850> scoring<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and then it's the highest scoring of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.569 
and then it's the highest scoring of
those<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> floor<00:00:44.340> area

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
those and then you go to the floor area

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
those and then you go to the floor area
where<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.930> minute<00:00:46.200> thirty<00:00:46.530> floor

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
where you have a one minute thirty floor

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
where you have a one minute thirty floor
routine<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> idea<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.210> obvious<00:00:48.629> stay<00:00:48.899> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
routine and the idea is obvious stay in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
routine and the idea is obvious stay in
bounds<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.860> again<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.340> mean<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> could<00:00:50.820> stay

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bounds and again I mean you could stay

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
bounds and again I mean you could stay
on<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.719> ten<00:00:52.050> elements<00:00:52.379> 15

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
on there for like ten elements 15

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
on there for like ten elements 15
elements<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.579> they'll<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.000> calculate<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
elements and they'll just calculate the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.740 
elements and they'll just calculate the
top<00:00:55.199> eight<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:57.090> start<00:00:57.420> values

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
top eight that you do the start values

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
top eight that you do the start values
it's<00:00:58.199> literally<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.399> eight<00:00:59.609> elements

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's literally your top eight elements

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's literally your top eight elements
put<00:01:00.629> together<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.289> each<00:01:01.379> na<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> point

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
put together and each na is like a point

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530 
put together and each na is like a point
one<00:01:03.030> score<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> B<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> point<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.769> any<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
one score of B is point to any and so on

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.170 
one score of B is point to any and so on
and<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:07.350> they'll<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.280> I've<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:09.409> eight

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
and what they'll do so if I've got eight

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
and what they'll do so if I've got eight
elements<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> value<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> D

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
elements that are all the value of a D

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
elements that are all the value of a D
which<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> point<00:01:14.400> four<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> gives<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
which is a point four so that gives me a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.380 
which is a point four so that gives me a
three<00:01:16.229> point<00:01:16.500> two<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> three<00:01:17.820> point<00:01:18.119> two

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
three point two on the three point two

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
three point two on the three point two
there's<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.900> added<00:01:19.290> certain<00:01:19.950> other

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
there's then added certain other

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
there's then added certain other
elements<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.000> certain<00:01:21.360> bits<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> pieces

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
elements and certain bits and pieces

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.679 
elements and certain bits and pieces
that<00:01:22.140> add<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.220> six<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.180> excellent

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that add up a six is like an excellent

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
that add up a six is like an excellent
start<00:01:25.049> value<00:01:25.500> anything<00:01:26.369> above<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.270> super

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
start value anything above that is super

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.899 
start value anything above that is super
good<00:01:28.020> gymnastics<00:01:28.650> depending<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.670> skills

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
good gymnastics depending on what skills

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.460 
good gymnastics depending on what skills
you<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.450> each<00:01:30.570> piece<00:01:30.810> depending<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you do on each piece depending is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
you do on each piece depending is
depends<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.159> high<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> starting<00:01:33.000> value

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
depends on how high you starting value

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
depends on how high you starting value
is<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.140> depending<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> do

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
is and then depending on how well you do

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
is and then depending on how well you do
the<00:01:35.189> scores<00:01:35.490> depends<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.150> many<00:01:36.210> points

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the scores depends on how many points

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
the scores depends on how many points
the<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.430> off<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.610> start<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the two just take off that start in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
the two just take off that start in
school<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:40.200> used<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.700> highest

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
school it used to be like the highest

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
school it used to be like the highest
goal<00:01:42.210> could<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.509> ten<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
goal could be ten but it's kind of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.539 
goal could be ten but it's kind of
changed<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:46.079> some<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.100> did<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> beam

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
changed now so say some we did a beam

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
changed now so say some we did a beam
routine<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.329> consisted<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> lots<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.770> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
routine and consisted of lots of really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
routine and consisted of lots of really
hard<00:01:50.520> elements<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> connections<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.710> got

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
hard elements and connections that got

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.969 
hard elements and connections that got
them<00:01:53.100> bonuses<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> starting

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
them bonuses it would be say a starting

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.749 
them bonuses it would be say a starting
value<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.880> don't<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.420> six<00:01:57.750> five<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.759> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
value of I don't know six five and and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
value of I don't know six five and and
then<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> judges<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.810> go<00:02:01.350> through<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
then the judges will go through the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
then the judges will go through the
routine<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.490> off<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.509> one

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
routine and take off like point one

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.510 
routine and take off like point one
point<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:04.110> point<00:02:04.500> three<00:02:04.590> four<00:02:04.920> wobbles<00:02:05.250> bent

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
point two point three four wobbles bent

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.350 
point two point three four wobbles bent
legs<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> fall<00:02:06.750> off<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> hallmark

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
legs if you fall off it's a hallmark

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.280 
legs if you fall off it's a hallmark
and<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:09.380> they<00:02:10.100> get<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.960> coldie<00:02:11.960> score

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and so then they get like a coldie score

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.390 
and so then they get like a coldie score
of<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.800> say<00:02:13.040> 8.6<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.030> they'd<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:15.130> one<00:02:16.130> point

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
of like say 8.6 so they'd have one point

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.540 
of like say 8.6 so they'd have one point
for<00:02:17.240> introductions<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.920> then<00:02:19.070> they<00:02:19.160> take<00:02:19.340> one

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
for introductions so then they take one

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.970 
for introductions so then they take one
point<00:02:19.700> four<00:02:20.030> off<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.780> six<00:02:21.140> six<00:02:21.710> point

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
point four off of that six six point

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.570 
point four off of that six six point
five<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:23.030> Beth<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.590> had<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:24.920> high<00:02:25.130> start<00:02:25.430> by

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
five if Beth that had that high start by

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.460 
five if Beth that had that high start by
you<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:25.820> she<00:02:26.030> fell<00:02:26.240> three<00:02:26.480> times<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.290> had

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you but she fell three times and I had

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.660 
you but she fell three times and I had
the<00:02:27.560> lowest<00:02:27.710> fat<00:02:27.980> lady<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.370> went<00:02:28.520> through

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the lowest fat lady but went through

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.560 
the lowest fat lady but went through
clean<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.060> could<00:02:29.240> still<00:02:29.480> beat<00:02:29.780> her<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:32.000> idea<00:02:32.390> is

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
clean I could still beat her the idea is

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.680 
clean I could still beat her the idea is
to<00:02:32.720> pack<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.590> minimum<00:02:33.950> amount<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.459> elements

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
to pack the minimum amount of elements

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.449 
to pack the minimum amount of elements
with<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.720> highest<00:02:36.020> difficulty<00:02:36.590> because<00:02:37.310> then

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
with the highest difficulty because then

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.730 
with the highest difficulty because then
hopefully<00:02:37.820> you<00:02:37.910> get<00:02:38.090> less<00:02:38.480> deductions<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
hopefully you get less deductions the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.680 
hopefully you get less deductions the
more<00:02:39.920> skills<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.459> do<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.150> literally<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
more skills you do you literally just

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.360 
more skills you do you literally just
get<00:02:41.870> more<00:02:42.080> deductions<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.980> then<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
get more deductions and then the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.970 
get more deductions and then the
deductions<00:02:43.910> are<00:02:44.060> from<00:02:44.360> ten<00:02:44.660> okay<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:45.650> they

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
deductions are from ten okay so they

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190 
deductions are from ten okay so they
will<00:02:46.190> still<00:02:46.459> deduct<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.270> from<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.780> score<00:02:48.140> of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
will still deduct you from a score of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.290 
will still deduct you from a score of
ten<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:49.100> then<00:02:49.280> they<00:02:49.459> will<00:02:49.610> add<00:02:49.730> on<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.209> your

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
ten but then they will add on to your

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.720 
ten but then they will add on to your
what's<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:51.020> start<00:02:51.530> value<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> top<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
what's your start value is on the top of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.610 
what's your start value is on the top of
that<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.080> little<00:02:54.290> complicated

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
that it's it's a little complicated

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.330 
that it's it's a little complicated
really<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:55.340> easier<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.940> see<00:02:56.180> it
