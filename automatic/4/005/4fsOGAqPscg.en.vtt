somebody gets one they can set it up and
get<00:01:25.680> growing<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
get growing and they don't have to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
get growing and they don't have to
invent<00:01:27.450> aquaponics<00:01:28.229> each<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> every<00:01:28.829> time<00:01:30.259> so
