all<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.260> check<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.070> guy<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
all right you check this guy out this is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
all right you check this guy out this is
actually<00:00:42.239> much<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> surface<00:00:43.770> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
actually much more like the surface in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
actually much more like the surface in
that<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.670> rectangular<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.170> tell

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that it's very rectangular you can tell

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.910 
that it's very rectangular you can tell
it's<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:47.010> meant<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.969> viewed

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
it's probably meant to be viewed

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.950 
it's probably meant to be viewed
horizontally<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.100> often<00:00:50.399> than<00:00:50.610> vertically

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
horizontally more often than vertically

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.180 
horizontally more often than vertically
seems<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.500> less<00:00:52.649> squared<00:00:53.039> off

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
seems just a little less squared off

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
seems just a little less squared off
than<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> iPad<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.390> has<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> nice<00:00:55.020> surface<00:00:55.410> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
than the iPad it has a nice surface on

than the iPad it has a nice surface on
the<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.610> sort<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> plastic

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the back actually it's sort of plastic

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.599 
the back actually it's sort of plastic
and<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.899> tacky<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.460> mean

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and a little bit tacky by which I mean

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.490 
and a little bit tacky by which I mean
it<00:00:59.760> doesn't<00:00:59.910> slide<00:01:00.390> around<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.989> much<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it doesn't slide around as much like you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
it doesn't slide around as much like you
