unboxing it our sport and what's cool

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
unboxing it our sport and what's cool
about<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.899> ability

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
about this is that you have the ability

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
about this is that you have the ability
to<00:00:49.379> strap<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:51.149> won't<00:00:51.300> slip

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to strap this in and it won't slip

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900 
to strap this in and it won't slip
because<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.469> clip<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.550> under<00:00:53.789> your

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
because it has the clip for under your

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.560 
because it has the clip for under your
arm<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> slip<00:00:54.989> off<00:00:55.170> and
