what<00:02:02.050> we're<00:02:02.140> going<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.320> do<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.860> clearly

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
what we're going to do this is clearly

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.260 
what we're going to do this is clearly
this<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.850> methanol<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:06.550> not<00:02:06.790> intercooled

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
this is on methanol so not intercooled

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.230 
this is on methanol so not intercooled
no<00:02:07.540> water<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.050> motor<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:10.119> we're

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
no water in the motor and what we're

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.750 
no water in the motor and what we're
going<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.390> do<00:02:10.540> is<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:12.100> down<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.550> pipe

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
going to do is this down this pipe

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
going to do is this down this pipe
actually<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.680> hoping<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.980> whole<00:02:15.010> pipe

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
actually is hoping that this whole pipe

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
actually is hoping that this whole pipe
if<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.670> notice<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> little<00:02:16.480> profile<00:02:16.920> our

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
if you notice how a little profile our

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.250 
if you notice how a little profile our
stuff<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:19.209> kind<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.570> down<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:20.050> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
stuff is we kind of get down here and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.130 
stuff is we kind of get down here and
centerline<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> blower<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.870> kind<00:02:23.080> of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
centerline of the blower you kind of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.870 
centerline of the blower you kind of
look<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.470> seen<00:02:23.680> what<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.070> stuff<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.580> so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
look at that seen what that stuff is so

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.120 
look at that seen what that stuff is so
maximum<00:02:25.690> good<00:02:25.959> clearance<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> lot

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
maximum good clearance but we have a lot

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.920 
maximum good clearance but we have a lot
of<00:02:27.310> design<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.970> lot<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.270> effort<00:02:28.540> put<00:02:28.750> into

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
of design and a lot of effort put into

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.750 
of design and a lot of effort put into
these<00:02:29.110> intake<00:02:29.470> manifolds<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> proper

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
these intake manifolds for the proper

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.050 
these intake manifolds for the proper
fuel<00:02:34.480> distribution<00:02:35.340> which<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.520> do<00:02:36.670> see<00:02:36.880> good

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
fuel distribution which we do see good

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.210 
fuel distribution which we do see good
fuel<00:02:37.270> distribution<00:02:37.450> pretty<00:02:38.230> minimal

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.979 

enrichment<00:02:42.750> differences<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.870> between

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
enrichment differences in between

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.509 
enrichment differences in between
cylinders<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.800> we<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.070> up<00:02:45.310> front<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.640> back

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
cylinders that we have up front the back

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.490 
cylinders that we have up front the back
anyway<00:02:48.519> it's<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.760> said<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.630> very<00:02:50.050> good<00:02:50.290> piece

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
anyway it's like said a very good piece

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190 
anyway it's like said a very good piece
here<00:02:50.739> what<00:02:51.160> we're<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:52.049> go<00:02:53.049> out

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
here what we're going to do is go out

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.430 
here what we're going to do is go out
now<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.400> we<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.180> three<00:02:56.049> different

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
now this is on we have three different

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.539 
now this is on we have three different
boost<00:02:57.400> level<00:02:57.700> tunes<00:02:57.970> for<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:59.400> we're<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.489> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
boost level tunes for it we're going to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.360 
boost level tunes for it we're going to
run<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.880> thing<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.620> go<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.010> show<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
run this thing and go out and show you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:50.600 
run this thing and go out and show you
all<00:03:03.459> numbers

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.509 

all<00:03:51.610> right<00:03:51.879> now<00:03:52.510> we'll<00:03:52.720> come<00:03:52.900> over<00:03:53.019> here<00:03:53.519> all

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
all right now we'll come over here all

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.800 
all right now we'll come over here all
right<00:03:54.760> now<00:03:54.819> let's<00:03:55.239> take<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.450> look<00:03:55.599> at<00:03:55.720> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
right now let's take a look at the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.530 
right now let's take a look at the
numbers<00:03:56.140> here<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.680> back<00:03:56.890> up<00:03:57.129> from<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.430> screen

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.320 

you<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:01.599> see<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.959> peak<00:04:02.140> number<00:04:02.440> right<00:04:02.620> there

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
you can see the peak number right there

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.920 
you can see the peak number right there
30:29<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:04.720> eighty<00:04:04.930> two<00:04:05.200> hundred<00:04:06.900> two<00:04:07.900> hundred

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
30:29 at eighty two hundred two hundred

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.080 
30:29 at eighty two hundred two hundred
thirty<00:04:08.890> two<00:04:08.920> thousand<00:04:09.370> six<00:04:09.580> foot<00:04:09.760> pounds<00:04:10.030> of

torque at seven thousand ice broad flat

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.699 
torque at seven thousand ice broad flat
right<00:04:12.730> here<00:04:12.989> it's<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.049> starting<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> roll

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
right here it's just starting to roll

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.890 
right here it's just starting to roll
right<00:04:14.980> here<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.790> normally<00:04:16.540> don't<00:04:16.660> run

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
right here so I normally don't run

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.319 
right here so I normally don't run
things<00:04:17.699> especially<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.729> bigger<00:04:18.880> motor<00:04:19.120> like

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
things especially a bigger motor like

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.820 
things especially a bigger motor like
this<00:04:20.489> or<00:04:21.489> 8500<00:04:22.360> or<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.870> mean<00:04:23.080> they'll<00:04:23.289> run<00:04:23.710> up

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
this or 8500 or so I mean they'll run up

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.270 
this or 8500 or so I mean they'll run up
there<00:04:23.979> all<00:04:24.070> time<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.400> track<00:04:24.699> but<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.470> scary

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
there all time on track but it's a scary

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.960 
there all time on track but it's a scary
around<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.669> dyno

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
there's there's more left in the blower

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.040 
there's there's more left in the blower
if<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.210> want<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.480> spin<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.810> little<00:05:02.930> bit

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
if we want to spin it a little bit

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.880 
if we want to spin it a little bit
faster<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> where<00:05:06.140> we<00:05:06.260> want<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.740> be

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
faster this is a where we want it to be

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.400 
faster this is a where we want it to be
and<00:05:07.360> there's<00:05:08.360> always<00:05:08.510> room<00:05:08.810> for<00:05:08.840> improvement

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
and there's always room for improvement

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.530 
and there's always room for improvement
but<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.920> will<00:05:10.040> be<00:05:10.400> probably<00:05:10.610> be<00:05:10.910> tuned<00:05:11.270> in<00:05:11.420> this

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
but it will be probably be tuned in this

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.620 
but it will be probably be tuned in this
