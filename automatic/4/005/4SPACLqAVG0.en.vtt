00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.169
 security a great tool so that 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.169
 the Salta people we are safer 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.540

 video surveillance center and we're going to 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.820
 show in this case another of the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.430
 work carried out in coordination with the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.370
 personal video surveillance both 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.620
 operators as street staff to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.839
 through the use of this technology that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.570
 they allow us to visualize and make a 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.680
 virtual pattern and detect facts like 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.159
 the one we are showing in these 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.159
 moments 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.420
 same time the operator doing the 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.909
 corresponding virtual patrol in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.610
 early morning hours around 3 o'clock 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.850
 notes that morning a young man 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.270
 he finds himself prowling the shopping center 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.580
 of a house of 20 cell phones located in 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.580
 calle mendoza and floyd I have 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 no no 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 and notice that this person climbs 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 the doors like trying to open it in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.580
 a principle is thought to be that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.490
 this person in turn goes down and suddenly 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.659
 it is observed that some element is carried 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.979
 in the hand and removed from the place by 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.979
 mendoza street 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.970
 that person starts running the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.050
 video surveillance staff already begins 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.490
 to manage the response to that incident 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.930
 calling the resource that is in 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.930
 the area 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.120
 it begins to coordinate the cameras that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.200
 you can also find the surroundings 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.680
 taking into account that already the camera 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.209
 located in mendoza loses sight of 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.209
 this person who was in that place 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.510
 from another camera located in the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.239
 In the vicinity, it is observed that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.519
 person follows his course while 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.040
 while the corresponding resource already 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.049
 from mendoza and buenos aires begins 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.629

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.340

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.500
 located in this corner of mendoza and 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.450
 buenos aires and proceeds to the arrest 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.450
 of this person's default 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.170
 to 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
 how 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.590
 when the requisition is made 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.440
 corresponding this person wore 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.720

 work of the operators depending on 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.120
 the images that the center shows us 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.690
