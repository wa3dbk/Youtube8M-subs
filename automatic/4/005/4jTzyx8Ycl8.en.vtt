to try to pull these pieces but instead
to<00:01:33.310> grab<00:01:33.850> one<00:01:34.090> working<00:01:34.329> one<00:01:34.720> end<00:01:34.929> work<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.649> that

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to grab one working one end work it that

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.999 
to grab one working one end work it that
way<00:01:35.979> grab<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.549> other<00:01:36.670> end<00:01:36.729> work<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.569> this<00:01:37.720> way

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
grab that end work it that way and then

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.270 
grab that end work it that way and then
that<00:01:40.479> builds<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.200> gives<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.500> some<00:01:41.679> slack

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
that builds that gives you some slack

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.960 
that builds that gives you some slack
usually<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.539> can<00:01:44.340> sew<00:01:45.340> work<00:01:45.549> back<00:01:45.789> and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
usually that you can sew work back and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.149 
usually that you can sew work back and
forth<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:47.679> can<00:01:47.829> get<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
forth like this and you can get the

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.980 
forth like this and you can get the
piece<00:01:48.630> off<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:52.179> reason<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.479> like<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.750> tie<00:01:52.929> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
piece off the reason I like to tie the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.190 
piece off the reason I like to tie the
slippery<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.539> stricter<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.780> bag<00:01:55.990> is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
slippery and stricter on the bag is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.359 
slippery and stricter on the bag is
because<00:01:56.979> it's<00:01:57.700> quick<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.060> tie<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.369> much

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
because it's quick to tie and much

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.419 
because it's quick to tie and much
quicker<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.729> untie<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.500> works<00:02:02.979> exactly<00:02:03.099> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
quicker to untie so it works exactly the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.589 
quicker to untie so it works exactly the
same<00:02:03.520> way<00:02:03.670> you're<00:02:03.939> just<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.270> tie<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
same way you're just going to tie the

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.050 
same way you're just going to tie the
last<00:02:04.929> part<00:02:05.229> with<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> bite<00:02:05.799> instead<00:02:06.729> of

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
last part with a bite instead of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.400 
last part with a bite instead of
slipping<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.450> whole<00:02:07.659> end<00:02:07.869> through<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:14.290> right

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
slipping the whole end through all right

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.650 
slipping the whole end through all right
so<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> I've<00:02:15.549> got<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.730> instead<00:02:16.569> of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so now that I've got that instead of

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.199 
so now that I've got that instead of
working<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.290> end<00:02:17.500> around<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.579> through<00:02:18.819> I'm

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
working the end around and through I'm

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.670 
working the end around and through I'm
going<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.599> take<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:21.150> piece<00:02:22.350> form<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.470> bite

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.440 
going to take this piece form a bite
with<00:02:23.920> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
