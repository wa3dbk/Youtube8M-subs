 how much is the base of galileo 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.690

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:35.510

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.090

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.500
 lieutenant james pull them out of orbit 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.570
 get away from requiem so that those things 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.520
 can not get the controls on board 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.710
 answer captain the infinity is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.330
 blocked capital looks there 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.310
 the artifact is acting as an anchor 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.930
 spatial slip and immobilizes us the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.460
 from space it is not physical not 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.430
 immobilized dhabi there are many things that 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.260
 we do not know from space you shut up 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.830
 you should have fixed that hole 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.830
 days ago 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.910
 200 capital 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.540
 damn it all was very fast 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.540
 they only came for her 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.450
 some of these plates were spartan 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.450

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.920
 the roofs 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.819
 cool 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.819
 watch this 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.489
 they are taking everything good 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.890
 LOL 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890
 what is this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.080
 great I have a map 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.280
 Captain Lasky Admiral Osman made us 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.890
 the report on half and I was advised 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.940
 that would leave catherine locked up under 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.790
 seven keys 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.370
 or that completely removed from the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.360
 equation 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.560
 unfortunately I did not do any of that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.830
 then captain today I will follow the advice 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.900
 from my predecessor I order you to eliminate 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.900
 to Dr. Catherine Elizabeth HauchÃ© 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.130
 and a lot 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.390
 counting 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.840
 I think you are looking to knowledge 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.840
 is power 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.879
 of assmann made this city 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.400
 I would not be so sure 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.110
 the protective shield comes out of one's own 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.700
 structure 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.700
 and if I'm not wrong 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.210
 you need a human touch to access
