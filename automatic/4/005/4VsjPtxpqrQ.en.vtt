00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that's it on the bottom put a valve in

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470 
that's it on the bottom put a valve in
on<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:26.789> chain<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.330> there

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on here on the side and a chain on there

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
on here on the side and a chain on there
so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.900> tow<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> Gator<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:28.949> one

ah<00:02:14.150> I'm<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.209> too<00:02:15.450> worried<00:02:15.629> about<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.610> quite

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610

pleased here we go

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.399 
pleased here we go
I<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> waters<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.599> defender<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:25.170> I

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
I think the waters don't defender so I

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.050 
I think the waters don't defender so I
suppose<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.099> other<00:02:26.129> thing<00:02:26.250> we've<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.849> put

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
suppose the other thing we've got put

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.339 
suppose the other thing we've got put
