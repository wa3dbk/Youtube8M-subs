00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
rate we're gonna set them to 80 and then

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
elevator does flip rate each solidi LED

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.030 
elevator does flip rate each solidi LED
indicates<00:00:39.090> 20%<00:00:40.079> each<00:00:40.379> flashing<00:00:40.950> LED<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> 10%

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
indicates 20% each flashing LED is 10%

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:59.080 
indicates 20% each flashing LED is 10%
so<00:00:44.040> 50%<00:00:44.870> yep<00:00:45.899> 40<00:00:46.680> plus<00:00:47.039> 10<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.610> 50<00:00:53.090> that's<00:00:54.090> 60<00:00:56.570> 70

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
so 50% yep 40 plus 10 is 50 that's 60 70

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.810 
so 50% yep 40 plus 10 is 50 that's 60 70
80<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.170> elevator<00:01:01.710> always<00:01:02.190> stays<00:01:02.489> within

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
80 now the elevator always stays within

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
80 now the elevator always stays within

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
20 percent of the aileron so if we do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.820 
20 percent of the aileron so if we do
the<00:01:08.100> elevator<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> start<00:01:10.470> at

collective at zero pitch so you don't

jam up your servos I recommend taking
this<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.790> 20<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> most<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.079> my

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
this to around 20 at the most on my

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.350 
this to around 20 at the most on my
model<00:02:08.629> it<00:02:09.629> caused<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> binding<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
model it caused a lot of binding I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.530 
model it caused a lot of binding I
thought<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> could<00:02:12.629> use<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.080> psyche

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
thought I could use the psyche

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.229 
thought I could use the psyche
like<00:02:13.659> bring<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.370> take<00:02:15.370> care<00:02:15.579> of<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> binding

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
like bring to take care of the binding

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030 
like bring to take care of the binding
but<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.930> didn't<00:02:17.230> work<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.709> thought<00:02:17.980> it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
but it didn't work the way I thought it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.580 
but it didn't work the way I thought it
would<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:19.000> you're<00:02:19.329> figuring<00:02:19.930> your<00:02:20.019> cyclic

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
would so if you're figuring your cyclic

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.679 
would so if you're figuring your cyclic
pitch<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.310> take<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.790> eight<00:02:22.000> degrees<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
pitch you take the eight degrees that

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.380 
pitch you take the eight degrees that
you<00:02:22.750> set<00:02:23.170> when<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.439> set<00:02:23.739> up<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.920> three<00:02:24.849> GX<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
you set when you set up the three GX and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140 
you set when you set up the three GX and
dir<00:02:25.689> mode<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.549> then<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:27.730> take<00:02:27.939> this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
dir mode and then you take this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.729 
dir mode and then you take this
percentage<00:02:28.810> x<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.620> age<00:02:29.769> eight<00:02:30.189> degrees<00:02:30.609> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
percentage x at age eight degrees and

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.509 
percentage x at age eight degrees and
you<00:02:32.739> add<00:02:33.040> them<00:02:33.189> together<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> at<00:02:34.840> 60%<00:02:35.519> you're

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
you add them together so at 60% you're

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.899 
you add them together so at 60% you're
adding<00:02:37.090> four<00:02:37.959> point<00:02:38.319> eight<00:02:38.500> degrees<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:39.280> eight

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
adding four point eight degrees to eight

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.429 
adding four point eight degrees to eight
degrees<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.780> twelve<00:02:41.109> point<00:02:41.349> eight

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.240

degrees that's a lot of cyclic I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.559

recommend<00:02:45.250> setting<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.730> at<00:02:45.879> about<00:02:45.970> twenty

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
recommend setting it at about twenty

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.069 
recommend setting it at about twenty
percent<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:48.250> working<00:02:48.519> your<00:02:48.670> way<00:02:48.790> up<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
percent and then working your way up you

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.960 
percent and then working your way up you
can<00:02:50.349> run<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.769> value<00:02:51.129> from<00:02:51.489> anywhere<00:02:51.909> from

can run the value from anywhere from

can run the value from anywhere from

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799

that<00:02:57.040> gives<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.430> eight<00:02:57.579> degrees<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.329> cyclic

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
