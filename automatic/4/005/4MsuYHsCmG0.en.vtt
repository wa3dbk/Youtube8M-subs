the<00:00:36.100> same<00:00:36.129> round<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.059> it's<00:00:37.210> just<00:00:37.450> different

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
the same round and it's just different

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.860 
the same round and it's just different
games<00:00:38.559> but<00:00:38.980> it's<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.030> same<00:00:40.239> round<00:00:40.450> as<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.719> can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
games but it's the same round as you can

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
see on the screen right now I actually

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.279
