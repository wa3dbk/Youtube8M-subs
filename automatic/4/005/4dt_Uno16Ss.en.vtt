00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.220

 be careful you can do that if you 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.560
 go in the treble if you want 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.360
 to look for more acute years after 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.479
 everyone does as he wants so that makes 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.920

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.319
 round 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.659
 once're for the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.890
 beautiful points 4 points when you 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.890
 elected representatives are present at nothing 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.680
 eighteen months that blow there I take 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.230
 the treble 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then we sell the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 misery we do it once our 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.530
 8 then we return to the ground 2.467 united in 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.569
 E major 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:02.970
 if you are so from the ground floor 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.970
 the sole 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.620
 and you saw how I took the ground 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.840
 with the fingers and eating the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.760
 following to you still selected 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.750
 which suits you more I think the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.160
 better not to put your finger there 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.400
 I put it often but do not 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.560
 to put 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.530
 stay in standard or so here for the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 couple is number 1 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.959
 now let's see their offer then for 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.740
 the chorus actually it's going to be very 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.819
 complicated there nothing to do ba ba to the bape 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 with chopsticks with me ba ba haut haut 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.370
 down high and so we will do on the back 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:47.540
 poppy babe on a ground not manon 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.959
 for on a linear month after on 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.959
 minors 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.620
 alone 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.620
 the stars of the east thanks to the singer 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.569
 as bad yet to apply 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.180
 we do not care so here are two times like 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.489
 then we have the couple is number 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.680
 two so much more number 2 we 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.620
 goes back on the minor has besides 4.5 this 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.270
 fall twice the same minor between 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.500
 the still minor leaders and what's going 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.980
 change is that you have to do it a 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.040
 only this time we will regret 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.040
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 no it's more laurent 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.250
 6g twice and only twice 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.169
 and we see it subscribe to loans 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.150
 etc all that's missing is that it's 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.920
 the bridge 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.440
 and the bridge then the fight against the ace 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.040
 a little more complicated we will start at a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.270
 bar and in 46 so not in training 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.740
 for those who really want to master 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.450
 bars and all the chords all that 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.620
 do not hesitate to contact me she is not 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.910
 not open at this point where the test of 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.200
 competence in video matters she 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.760
 is open so go in the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.080
 description register or you will be so 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.620
 it is open as a stopover at the harbor 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.190
 so here is what we call a re 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.200
 sharp 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.220
 so pay attention to the gains 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.750
 modest at that time then at jerez and 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.790
 number of actions it's the click that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.790
 for for the child 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.550
 two times 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.990
 then we will go in G minor 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.990
