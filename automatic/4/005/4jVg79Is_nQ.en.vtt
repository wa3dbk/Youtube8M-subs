00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.240
 my name is javier molina our city 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.100
 point is and today we are going to see how to process 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.350
 an astronomical image of the solar system 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.020
 we have seen in previous videos as 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.090
 stack with auto stacker how to process 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.520
 with registering and now we're going to go to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.190
 the revolutions and the reduction of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.620
 noise with pitch world in front now 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.840
 on the screen we have on hand 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.059
 left a pre processed with records 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.309
 how would it look after having 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.260
 applied the image and after having 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.780
 adjusted the curve and stretched the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.059
 wailers as you see on the left we 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.860
 there is an image already quite clear with 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.020
 details of the moon but on the right 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.030
 we are seeing how you can get to 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 stay if we do post-processing 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.050
 Many people stay in this step and do not 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.610
 comes to do it that's why I invite you to 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 you get into the menus that I 'm going to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.310
 teach today of this magnificent program and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.320
 that you advance in this small step of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 post processed that are convolution is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.380
 and noise reduction for it 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 I'm going to focus on working with this with 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.360
 this image of your thermal 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.330
 what is an interesting image because 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.810
 comes from a camera that has a bayer 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.020
 that is to say a scholarship 21 a camera in color 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.960
 that we get an image with the matrix of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.940
 bayer if you look closely you have the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.190
 squares still immersed in the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.260
 own image then it is one of the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.140
 things that will take away from us in the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.240
 composition if we are going to look for what 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 it means convolution because it is the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.330
 noise elimination product of a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.090
 process 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 of producer in processing and an image 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.150
 then we will processed filters from 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.650
 convolution approach brings out a 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.780
 new image because the face word that 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.190
 always going to work we handle the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.010
 previous image so we can 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.770
 compare with the new image is what 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.620
 will modify us in this step of the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.300
 composition well then we have here the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.790
 image and we're going to focus on this 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.590
 dialog box we have to the right 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.350
 the profit that we could raise it and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.580
 work with both strips and with both 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.530
 to both columns of annotation x and radio to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 I like to leave it all down and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.570
 work only with this with this 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 side basically and how this is a 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.260
 summary tutorial I'm just going to work 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.230
 so you can see dadis front with the radio 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.160
 and with the video of the image I leave 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.740
 radio 150 the noise of the image 1 I give 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.170
 to calculate fix on the image I'm going to 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.930
 calculate and has already softened me first 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.950
 I have removed the array of byers to the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.540
 left 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.030
 I still have the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.500
 the grids I do not know if you see it 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.439
 depending on the definition you have 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.750
 on the screen and right and not 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.450
 I have and say it has already removed that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.640
 problem above if I had here 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 more noise than I'm not seeing the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.510
 the cancellation but if you see granulation 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.489
 so I have to lower the radius of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.859
 done let's try for example to 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.299
 to lower it dramatically I give it to calculate 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.790
 and the image is blurred 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.670
 equally if I take it to the other side the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.650
 image will be grainy here 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.079
 we almost do not see it but there is much more 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.689
 grain then I like to start more 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.010
 or less than 150 because many times it's the 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.040
 point at which the image is located 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.739
 more comfortable and then we have the noise of 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.549
 the image here we can also lower the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.859
 noise less dramatically until 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.230
 a point where we consider that no 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.230
 it has grain and it still keeps us 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.000
 definition I give you although we have already done 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.130
 The first phase 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.310
 Now we give processed filters 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.800
 blur track filter noise with smells 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.300
 and we get a third image to remember 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.420
 that every step we take we will take 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.920
 a new box well here we have 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.170
 our image and the first thing that I'm going to 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.150
 to do is to give him to calculate the image 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.950
 it's just going to vary and it has varied 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.290
 little mega soften a little but 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.239
 I have this column on the right and 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.040
 I insist it is a summary tutorial then 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.130
 I'm just going to put in this strip is very 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.930
 similar to the adjustment we're going to make 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.760
 very similar to registering when 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.150
 we stretch the wave let's 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.440
 because having given it to calculate 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.420
 directly any modification here 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.090
 will teach me in real time 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.010
 then I'm modifying this image and 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.620
 I'm stretching until the image I see 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.630
 have grain and here for example and 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.390
 it has contaminated us with noise and 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.150
 then it went down until the image is 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.570
 perfectly well you have picked up more 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.910
 definition and do not generate that noise 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.250
 passed the second strip and I do again 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.750
 the same thing I'm moving to the right if 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.510
 advance too much, it turns us back 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.180
 burn what is then my position 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.680
 of none and I'm moving to the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.560
 point where you see that you can stretch 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.990
 without spoiling the image basically 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.480
 It would be something like this 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.600
 the third strip we do again what 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.950
 same we stretch again to the taste of 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.130
 consumer and the last power strip 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.900
 usually it's usually towards the other side 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.020
 because if we stretch to this side it goes up 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.940
 to change us pretty well are images in 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.640
 all colors and if it is an image 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.830
 monochrome the definition in terms 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.080
 negative to me here and for example I 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.750
 Like or Permian I'm already seeing the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.000
 details in the center of the image in 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.130
 highlight the shadows that is producing 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.220
 the sun fighting I will give you 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.060
 ok and eliminating the intermediate images 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.920
 I'm going to compare the initial image to the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.440
 image that we have finally obtained 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.140
 make to the left we have an image 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.300
 with the bayer grid we have 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.360
 an image with hardly any definition in a 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.910
 false color and so on to the right 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.370
 we have managed to get bigger 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.289
 definition remove the bayer pattern and 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.379
 if you look at him 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.839
 around the contour of the crater 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:18.099
 let's see more detail for example 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:21.409
 look at this one concrete here 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:25.189
 or simply look at the center of the 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.839
 image to be fixed in some area by 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.259
 example is that here I see it very clear 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:33.289
 not only as we have won with respect to 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.089
 the previous then good then 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.490
 we have just made a post 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.469
 processed winning in image quality 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.199
 in very little time 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.819
 this is an express tutorial that does not 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.339
 intends to deepen in it but 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.229
 fix with very little effort the 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:50.180
 gain that we've already had so 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.999
 I invite you to sign up for 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.039
 our tutorials to the following 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:59.240
 tutorials on youtube and in our 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:02.059
 website www.dgt.es or our courses 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.949
 of intensive planetary astrophotography 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.599
 of weekend so nothing more a 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.599
 greeting and until the next tutorial 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.190
