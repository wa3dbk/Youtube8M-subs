then make it repeat the same pattern as
you<00:01:44.880> made<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:45.990> before<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.579> once

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you made it do before and it's once

you've got some lights on it too so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.050 
you've got some lights on it too so
first<00:01:50.310> things<00:01:50.490> first<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
first things first this is the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
first things first this is the
controlling<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:58.170> way<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> works<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
controlling you get the way it works is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
controlling you get the way it works is
you<00:02:00.350> lift<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.530> plug<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.820> device<00:02:03.600> in

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you lift this up plug your device in

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.490 
you lift this up plug your device in
here<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.250> slots<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.380> then<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
here so it just slots in and then you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.900 
here so it just slots in and then you
just<00:02:07.710> plug<00:02:07.890> back<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> headphone<00:02:08.520> jack

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
just plug back into the headphone jack

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.990 
just plug back into the headphone jack
and<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.959> works<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.770> infrared<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.730> what

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and it works with infrared which is what

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.190 
and it works with infrared which is what
this<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.760 
this is
the<00:02:13.349> application<00:02:13.890> itself<00:02:15.170> by<00:02:16.170> Griffin

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
the application itself by Griffin

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.300 
the application itself by Griffin
and<00:02:17.390> you've<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:24.950> directional<00:02:25.950> stick<00:02:26.160> there

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and you've got directional stick there

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.490 
and you've got directional stick there
you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.550> also<00:02:26.670> opt<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.150> control<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.989> with<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you can also opt to control it with the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
you can also opt to control it with the
accelerometer<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> gyroscope<00:02:30.050> here

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
accelerometer and the gyroscope here

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.840 
accelerometer and the gyroscope here
you've<00:02:31.260> got<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.530> liftoff<00:02:32.069> pad<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:32.700> I'll

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
you've got your liftoff pad which I'll

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.430 
you've got your liftoff pad which I'll
show<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.390> works<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> second<00:02:34.050> here's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
show you how it works in a second here's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.990 
show you how it works in a second here's
an<00:02:34.530> emergency<00:02:35.010> landing<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.610> press<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
an emergency landing when you press the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.370 
an emergency landing when you press the
orange<00:02:36.120> button<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> basically<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:36.959> drops

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
orange button it basically just drops

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.500 
orange button it basically just drops
from<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> sky<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.180> you've<00:02:39.300> got<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
from the sky and then you've got the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.670 
from the sky and then you've got the
option<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> turn<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> lights<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.560> then

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
option to turn on the lights and then

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680 
option to turn on the lights and then
you<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> option<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.370> record<00:02:41.690> separate

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
you have the option to record separate

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690 
you have the option to record separate
flight<00:02:42.900> plans<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:43.739> well<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
flight plans there as well the way it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.070 
flight plans there as well the way it
works<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.360> reason<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.840> have

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
works is the reason you have to have

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.930 
works is the reason you have to have
your<00:02:46.170> headphone<00:02:46.530> jack<00:02:46.830> plugged<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
your headphone jack plugged in and the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
your headphone jack plugged in and the
volume<00:02:48.300> turned<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.630> all<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> way<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:50.100> cause

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
volume turned up all the way it's cause

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:00.680 
volume turned up all the way it's cause
it<00:02:50.280> ascends<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.989> sounds<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.739> this<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it ascends and sounds like this and the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.280 
it ascends and sounds like this and the
different<00:03:01.110> sounds<00:03:01.440> tell<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.510> infrared<00:03:03.510> what

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
different sounds tell the infrared what

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.350 
different sounds tell the infrared what
to<00:03:04.470> broadcast<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> helicopter<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
to broadcast to the helicopter so that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.250 
to broadcast to the helicopter so that
was<00:03:06.540> lift<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:06.930> liftoff<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:08.540> Lights<00:03:12.260> so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
was lift at liftoff this is Lights so

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.780 
was lift at liftoff this is Lights so
each<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.440> them<00:03:13.620> has<00:03:13.769> got<00:03:13.890> its<00:03:14.069> own<00:03:14.190> unique

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.009 

sequence<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.269> gets<00:03:18.510> sent<00:03:18.690> through<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
sequence that gets sent through the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.750 
sequence that gets sent through the
headphone<00:03:19.350> jack<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:20.160> for<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> helicopter

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
headphone jack now for the helicopter

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.520 
headphone jack now for the helicopter
itself<00:03:24.320> which<00:03:25.320> doesn't<00:03:25.769> look<00:03:25.950> helicopter<00:03:26.370> yet

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
itself which doesn't look helicopter yet

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
itself which doesn't look helicopter yet
I'll<00:03:28.530> find<00:03:29.310> out<00:03:29.549> how<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.880> fix<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.299> in<00:03:30.420> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
I'll find out how to fix that in a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.970 
I'll find out how to fix that in a
second<00:03:30.870> they'll<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.170> instructions<00:03:31.650> somewhere

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
second they'll be instructions somewhere

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.460 
second they'll be instructions somewhere
but<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.359> what<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.600> get<00:03:36.109> it's<00:03:37.109> very<00:03:37.290> well

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
but this is what you get it's very well

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.259 
but this is what you get it's very well
made<00:03:39.109> metal<00:03:40.109> pipes<00:03:40.579> plastic<00:03:41.579> body<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.060> light

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
made metal pipes plastic body the light

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.340 
made metal pipes plastic body the light
there<00:03:42.709> on<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.890> front<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.280> there<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
there on the front and there and that is

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.410 
there on the front and there and that is
three<00:03:46.350> lights<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.829> front<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.430> then

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
three lights on the front and then

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.259 
three lights on the front and then
you've<00:03:48.570> got<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:49.609> tailspin<00:03:50.609> atutor<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
you've got a tailspin atutor that

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.940 
you've got a tailspin atutor that
actually<00:03:51.630> works<00:03:51.840> or<00:03:52.109> not<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.620> we'll<00:03:52.739> soon

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
actually works or not but we'll soon

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.099 
actually works or not but we'll soon
find<00:03:52.980> out<00:03:53.340> about<00:03:54.120> there<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> second

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
find out about there for a second

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:09.849 
find out about there for a second
you<00:03:55.290> also<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.920> a<00:04:01.640> paste<00:04:02.640> via<00:04:02.850> USB<00:04:03.150> lead

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.080 

so<00:04:10.859> quite<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.159> few<00:04:11.430> things<00:04:11.609> actually<00:04:11.760> you'd<00:04:12.090> get

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
so quite a few things actually you'd get

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.779 
so quite a few things actually you'd get
spare<00:04:15.090> wings<00:04:18.229> croffer<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.519> couple<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.579> spare

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
spare wings croffer a couple of spare

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.080 
spare wings croffer a couple of spare
tail<00:04:21.060> wings<00:04:21.359> too<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:23.280> then<00:04:23.400> lead<00:04:23.729> which

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
tail wings too and then lead which

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.330 
tail wings too and then lead which
connects<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:27.199> power<00:04:28.199> source<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:28.919> must

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
connects to a power source so that must

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.370 
connects to a power source so that must
mean<00:04:31.850> yeah<00:04:32.850> cool<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.020> charge<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.320> up

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
mean yeah cool so you can charge it up

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.010 
mean yeah cool so you can charge it up
via<00:04:34.530> USB<00:04:34.830> as<00:04:35.039> well<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.180> will<00:04:36.300> get<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.600> set<00:04:36.960> of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
via USB as well but I will get a set of

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.050 
via USB as well but I will get a set of
batteries<00:04:37.139> inside<00:04:38.009> this<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:38.910> all

with me yeah running on the iPad since
the<00:04:50.610> last<00:04:50.759> time<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.030> recorded<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.780> intro<00:04:52.169> and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
the last time I recorded that intro and

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.400 
the last time I recorded that intro and
it's<00:04:52.979> been<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.400> while<00:04:53.759> but<00:04:54.090> now<00:04:54.990> I'm<00:04:55.110> gonna<00:04:55.229> show

it's been a while but now I'm gonna show
you<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.740> action<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.280> I'm<00:04:56.400> gonna<00:04:56.520> use<00:04:56.669> my<00:04:56.820> iPad

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
you in action and I'm gonna use my iPad

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.550 
you in action and I'm gonna use my iPad

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
quite tough to fly it kind of seems to

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.330 
quite tough to fly it kind of seems to
have<00:05:56.699> two<00:05:56.879> options<00:05:57.240> which<00:05:57.389> are<00:05:57.539> either<00:05:57.800> on<00:05:58.800> or

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
have two options which are either on or

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.239 
have two options which are either on or
off<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.300> basically<00:06:00.840> if<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:01.800> don't<00:06:01.949> want<00:06:02.099> hit

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249 
off so basically if you don't want hit

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.029 
off so basically if you don't want hit
in<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.430> ceiling<00:06:02.729> a<00:06:02.819> few<00:06:02.999> times<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.539> get<00:06:03.840> it

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
in the ceiling a few times and get it

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.719 
in the ceiling a few times and get it
bumped<00:06:05.039> around<00:06:05.249> a<00:06:05.340> bit

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
bumped around a bit

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.080

you'd<00:06:06.389> be<00:06:06.479> okay<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.979> temple<00:06:08.580> itself<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:08.999> way

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
you'd be okay the temple itself the way

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.059 
you'd be okay the temple itself the way
it's<00:06:09.240> designed<00:06:09.389> with<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.439> foldable<00:06:10.800> wings

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
it's designed with the foldable wings

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.390 
it's designed with the foldable wings
and<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.400> bending<00:06:12.180> in<00:06:12.479> stuff<00:06:12.990> means<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:13.919> it's

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
and the bending in stuff means that it's

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.059 
and the bending in stuff means that it's
quite<00:06:14.699> resilient<00:06:14.999> to<00:06:15.419> knocks<00:06:16.289> and<00:06:16.560> drops<00:06:16.800> as

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
quite resilient to knocks and drops as

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.589 
quite resilient to knocks and drops as
you<00:06:17.099> can<00:06:17.279> see<00:06:17.430> from<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.759> outtakes<00:06:18.090> we<00:06:18.449> did

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
you can see from the outtakes we did

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.309 
you can see from the outtakes we did
there<00:06:18.810> I<00:06:19.020> think<00:06:20.009> it<00:06:20.550> hit<00:06:20.879> the<00:06:21.419> bed<00:06:21.629> frame<00:06:21.990> about

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
there I think it hit the bed frame about

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.409 
there I think it hit the bed frame about
ten<00:06:22.620> times<00:06:22.860> get<00:06:23.490> my<00:06:23.610> printer<00:06:23.969> about<00:06:24.150> four

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
ten times get my printer about four

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.719 
ten times get my printer about four
times<00:06:24.800> bounced<00:06:25.800> across<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.129> ceiling<00:06:26.490> four

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
times bounced across the ceiling four

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.869 
times bounced across the ceiling four
times<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.210> then<00:06:27.569> fell<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.080> floor<00:06:28.250> so<00:06:29.250> it's

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
times and then fell to the floor so it's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.999 
times and then fell to the floor so it's
very<00:06:30.060> good<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.629> hasn't<00:06:30.870> broken<00:06:30.960> which<00:06:31.650> is<00:06:31.740> good

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
very good it hasn't broken which is good

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.249 
very good it hasn't broken which is good
because<00:06:32.250> it's<00:06:32.430> expensive<00:06:32.930> but<00:06:33.930> it<00:06:33.990> does<00:06:34.110> take

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
because it's expensive but it does take

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.899 
because it's expensive but it does take
a<00:06:34.289> lot<00:06:34.469> of<00:06:34.529> getting<00:06:34.740> used<00:06:34.800> to<00:06:35.039> and<00:06:35.310> Griffin<00:06:35.669> in

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
a lot of getting used to and Griffin in

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.080 
a lot of getting used to and Griffin in
the<00:06:35.969> new<00:06:36.360> update<00:06:36.479> on<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.870> app<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:37.259> did<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:38.159> expert

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
the new update on the app I did a expert

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.240 
the new update on the app I did a expert
mode<00:06:41.659> is<00:06:42.659> basically<00:06:43.289> a<00:06:43.409> mode<00:06:43.710> you<00:06:43.860> switch<00:06:44.069> on

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
mode is basically a mode you switch on

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.550 
mode is basically a mode you switch on
within<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.610> app<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:45.509> option<00:06:45.810> is<00:06:45.960> there<00:06:46.289> and

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
within the app the option is there and

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.350 
within the app the option is there and
you<00:06:47.069> can<00:06:47.099> turn<00:06:47.339> it<00:06:47.460> off<00:06:47.550> if<00:06:47.699> you<00:06:47.789> want<00:06:50.150> and<00:06:51.150> then

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
you can turn it off if you want and then

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.510 
you can turn it off if you want and then
what<00:06:51.449> that<00:06:51.479> does<00:06:51.569> is<00:06:51.839> limits<00:06:52.199> the<00:06:52.409> lift<00:06:52.919> off<00:06:53.159> by

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
what that does is limits the lift off by

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.450 
what that does is limits the lift off by
half<00:06:53.759> so<00:06:54.479> you<00:06:54.539> can<00:06:54.659> only<00:06:54.810> go<00:06:54.960> from<00:06:55.229> 0<00:06:55.740> up<00:06:56.009> to

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
half so you can only go from 0 up to

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.420 
half so you can only go from 0 up to
halfway<00:06:57.229> which<00:06:58.229> only<00:06:58.710> gives<00:06:58.949> you<00:06:59.129> half<00:06:59.400> the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
halfway which only gives you half the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.230 
halfway which only gives you half the
power<00:06:59.870> whereas<00:07:00.870> expert<00:07:01.379> would<00:07:02.310> give<00:07:03.029> you<00:07:03.120> the

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
power whereas expert would give you the

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.429 
power whereas expert would give you the
full<00:07:03.449> bar<00:07:03.779> to<00:07:04.710> use<00:07:04.830> from<00:07:04.979> top<00:07:05.189> to<00:07:05.219> bottom<00:07:05.339> so

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
full bar to use from top to bottom so

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.959 
full bar to use from top to bottom so
what<00:07:07.439> I<00:07:07.500> seem<00:07:07.770> to<00:07:07.860> find<00:07:08.159> is<00:07:08.399> if<00:07:08.550> you<00:07:08.699> just<00:07:08.729> went

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
what I seem to find is if you just went

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.249 
what I seem to find is if you just went
like<00:07:09.149> this<00:07:09.300> you<00:07:10.310> would<00:07:11.310> hit<00:07:11.610> the<00:07:11.729> ceiling<00:07:12.259> if

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
like this you would hit the ceiling if

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.019 
like this you would hit the ceiling if
you<00:07:13.529> did<00:07:13.710> it<00:07:13.800> slowly<00:07:14.219> it<00:07:14.339> would<00:07:14.399> sort<00:07:14.639> of<00:07:14.699> Bob

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
you did it slowly it would sort of Bob

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:17.029 
you did it slowly it would sort of Bob
on<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.300> floor<00:07:15.629> and<00:07:15.930> then<00:07:16.319> as<00:07:16.500> you<00:07:16.649> got<00:07:16.770> higher

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 
on the floor and then as you got higher

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.499 
on the floor and then as you got higher
and<00:07:17.069> higher<00:07:17.460> with<00:07:17.759> then<00:07:17.909> it's<00:07:18.060> all<00:07:18.180> glide

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
and higher with then it's all glide

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.269 
and higher with then it's all glide
backwards<00:07:19.139> on<00:07:19.289> the<00:07:19.409> floor<00:07:19.649> again<00:07:19.949> and<00:07:20.159> then

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:20.279 
backwards on the floor again and then

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.040 
backwards on the floor again and then
hit<00:07:20.490> something<00:07:20.879> so<00:07:21.360> you<00:07:21.419> kind<00:07:21.689> of<00:07:21.750> have<00:07:21.899> to

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
hit something so you kind of have to

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.659 
hit something so you kind of have to
pick<00:07:22.229> a<00:07:22.289> spot<00:07:22.710> which<00:07:23.039> is<00:07:23.159> near<00:07:23.339> the<00:07:23.460> halfway

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:23.669 
pick a spot which is near the halfway

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.969 
pick a spot which is near the halfway
mark<00:07:24.029> and<00:07:24.629> just<00:07:24.839> go<00:07:24.990> like<00:07:25.289> that

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
mark and just go like that

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.439 
mark and just go like that
and<00:07:26.310> hope<00:07:26.490> that<00:07:26.639> it<00:07:26.729> goes<00:07:26.849> up<00:07:27.000> to<00:07:27.120> it<00:07:27.240> but<00:07:27.330> it

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
and hope that it goes up to it but it

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.230 
and hope that it goes up to it but it
takes<00:07:27.599> a<00:07:27.689> lot<00:07:27.839> of<00:07:27.870> practice<00:07:28.319> I<00:07:29.279> only<00:07:30.029> did<00:07:30.210> about

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
takes a lot of practice I only did about

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.920 
takes a lot of practice I only did about
three<00:07:30.810> successful<00:07:32.330> long<00:07:33.330> about<00:07:33.539> one<00:07:33.779> minute

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
three successful long about one minute

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.450 
three successful long about one minute
fly<00:07:34.229> paths<00:07:34.529> in<00:07:34.860> that<00:07:35.479> practice<00:07:36.479> then<00:07:37.129> but<00:07:38.129> a

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
fly paths in that practice then but a

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.540 
fly paths in that practice then but a
lot<00:07:39.300> more<00:07:39.330> outtakes<00:07:39.930> and<00:07:40.289> the<00:07:41.039> battery<00:07:41.370> life

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
lot more outtakes and the battery life

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.879 
lot more outtakes and the battery life
on<00:07:41.610> it<00:07:41.729> is<00:07:41.819> not<00:07:41.939> fantastic<00:07:42.270> either<00:07:42.689> it<00:07:43.620> will

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:43.889 
on it is not fantastic either it will

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:46.070 
on it is not fantastic either it will
only<00:07:44.099> last<00:07:44.430> something<00:07:45.029> like<00:07:45.389> I<00:07:45.539> think<00:07:45.599> it's<00:07:45.779> 20

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 
only last something like I think it's 20

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.589 
only last something like I think it's 20
minutes<00:07:46.349> flight<00:07:46.589> time<00:07:46.620> for<00:07:47.430> every<00:07:47.639> charge<00:07:47.849> but

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 
minutes flight time for every charge but

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:49.700 
minutes flight time for every charge but
and<00:07:48.719> it<00:07:48.779> takes<00:07:48.960> about<00:07:49.080> the<00:07:49.169> same<00:07:49.409> length<00:07:49.620> of

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.710 
and it takes about the same length of

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.619 
and it takes about the same length of
time<00:07:49.800> to<00:07:49.919> charge<00:07:50.219> up<00:07:50.370> again<00:07:50.490> so<00:07:50.909> you'd<00:07:51.539> be

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:51.629 
time to charge up again so you'd be

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.020 
time to charge up again so you'd be
charging<00:07:51.960> it<00:07:52.020> a<00:07:52.080> lot

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.030 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.080 

but<00:07:55.660> if<00:07:55.720> you<00:07:55.930> get<00:07:56.650> good<00:07:56.770> at<00:07:56.800> it<00:07:57.040> obviously<00:07:57.970> it's

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.090 
but if you get good at it obviously it's

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.270 
but if you get good at it obviously it's
a<00:07:58.180> nice<00:07:58.420> little<00:07:58.600> toy<00:07:58.840> to<00:07:58.900> have<00:07:59.200> it's<00:07:59.950> probably

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 
a nice little toy to have it's probably

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.150 
a nice little toy to have it's probably
better<00:08:00.490> to<00:08:00.900> use<00:08:01.900> it<00:08:02.080> in<00:08:02.170> the<00:08:02.260> outdoors<00:08:02.650> because

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.160 
better to use it in the outdoors because

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.650 
better to use it in the outdoors because
you're<00:08:03.670> less<00:08:03.820> likely<00:08:03.850> to<00:08:04.120> bump<00:08:04.300> into<00:08:04.600> stuff

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:04.660 
you're less likely to bump into stuff

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.390 
you're less likely to bump into stuff
and<00:08:04.990> you've<00:08:05.080> got<00:08:05.200> more<00:08:05.380> free<00:08:05.650> space<00:08:05.980> to<00:08:06.280> be

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 
and you've got more free space to be

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.810 
and you've got more free space to be
able<00:08:06.520> to<00:08:06.760> practice<00:08:07.420> with<00:08:08.340> but<00:08:09.340> yeah<00:08:09.490> that's

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:09.820 
able to practice with but yeah that's

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:16.350 
able to practice with but yeah that's
the<00:08:10.120> Griffin<00:08:10.950> kilo<00:08:11.950> TC<00:08:14.580> very<00:08:15.580> good<00:08:15.790> I've<00:08:16.030> rated

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 
the Griffin kilo TC very good I've rated

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.450 
the Griffin kilo TC very good I've rated
