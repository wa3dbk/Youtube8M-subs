run all the way to the bottom the docs
take<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> left<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.490> his<00:00:08.580> right<00:00:08.760> there<00:00:08.940> you'll

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
take a left in his right there you'll

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.430 
take a left in his right there you'll
obviously<00:00:09.240> notice<00:00:09.690> them<00:00:09.809> today<00:00:10.050> we<00:00:10.200> asked<00:00:10.349> for

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
obviously notice them today we asked for

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.890 
obviously notice them today we asked for
an<00:00:10.500> elite<00:00:10.650> as<00:00:10.830> usual<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.550> got<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.059> medium

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
an elite as usual and we got a medium

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.930 
an elite as usual and we got a medium
clove<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.440> again<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.950> guess<00:00:14.130> better<00:00:14.490> than<00:00:14.580> easy

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
clove so again I guess better than easy

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
clove so again I guess better than easy
not<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.870> good<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> hard<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:16.650> always<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
not as good as a hard but always the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.640 
not as good as a hard but always the
chance<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.699> getting<00:00:18.359> Ranger<00:00:18.690> boots<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
chance of getting Ranger boots which you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.620 
chance of getting Ranger boots which you
know<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.070> reason<00:00:20.100> Ranger<00:00:21.090> boots<00:00:21.270> are<00:00:21.390> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
know for some reason Ranger boots are so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
know for some reason Ranger boots are so
much<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:21.840> dang<00:00:22.260> expensive<00:00:22.980> than<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> Robin

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
much more dang expensive than a Robin

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.830 
much more dang expensive than a Robin
Hood<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.029> guessing<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.600> because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
Hood at now I'm guessing it just because

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.470 
Hood at now I'm guessing it just because
they<00:00:25.710> give<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> best<00:00:26.580> range<00:00:26.880> bonus<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
they give the best range bonus in the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
they give the best range bonus in the
game<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.560> gotten<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> rob

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
game but I don't know I've gotten to rob

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.099 
game but I don't know I've gotten to rob
Manzano<00:00:29.490> seven<00:00:29.880> I've<00:00:30.119> never<00:00:30.420> gotten<00:00:30.689> snake

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
Manzano seven I've never gotten snake

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
Manzano seven I've never gotten snake
not<00:00:31.650> skating<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.219> lot<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> snakes<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
not skating about lot of snakes and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
not skating about lot of snakes and
boots<00:00:32.910> never<00:00:33.360> gotten<00:00:33.630> Ranger<00:00:33.899> boots<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
boots never gotten Ranger boots so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.889 
boots never gotten Ranger boots so
obviously<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.510> used<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
obviously I'm not really used to the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
obviously I'm not really used to the
medium<00:00:37.200> step<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.800> took<00:00:38.489> forever<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
medium step so these took forever to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.040 
medium step so these took forever to
complete<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.840> don't<00:00:39.930> have

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
complete because I was like I don't have

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
complete because I was like I don't have
this<00:00:40.230> item<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
this item or I don't know where this is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
this item or I don't know where this is
but<00:00:42.390> mediums<00:00:43.379> obviously<00:00:43.680> pretty<00:00:43.950> easy<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> get

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
but mediums obviously pretty easy to get

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
but mediums obviously pretty easy to get
so<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.910> believe<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.719> step<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so I believe this step was in the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.130 
so I believe this step was in the
ranging<00:00:46.829> guild<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> after<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.149> had

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
ranging guild and after this one I had

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100 
ranging guild and after this one I had
to<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> under<00:00:49.890> shanties<00:00:50.489> awning<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to do it under shanties awning and just

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.660 
to do it under shanties awning and just
had<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> bunch<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.890> emotes<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
had to do a bunch of little emotes and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
had to do a bunch of little emotes and
