00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 1 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.700
 whether you are a couple or single 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.230
 this year the valentine's day falls a 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.090
 Friday so there is really no 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.220
 reason not to take advantage of your 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.590
 evening today I offer you a 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.480
 makeup tutorial and a hairstyle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.270
 ladies between is very simple to achieve 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.190
 the end result will look like associates 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.170
 so it's a bad makeup rather 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.700
 sweet for just sublime and your look 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.020
 but not to hide your beauty 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 natural because after all it's this 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.950
 that you have better I confess that 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.510
 Valentine's Day is not something 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.130
 thing that I do I think that when we 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.930
 love someone we love them all 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 days a little more and we choose not a 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.390
 date for him but a little bit more 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.460
 so here we are going to start this tutorial 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.470
 I start by applying a pink blush 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.510
 pale this one comes from mac but 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.250
 any light pink a little iridescent 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.160
 would have to do it this is going to bring this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.080
 light touch to look at and then I 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.550
 come take the pallet urban decay there 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.740
 two jokes palettes and I'm going 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.130
 use the lighthouse move that inside 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.509
 who a pretty dark farmall I pose the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 lighthouse from the outside to the inside 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.160
 to really mark and intensify the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 no longer possible outer corner of the eyes 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 it's really the side we're looking for 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.940
 it is to intensify the outer corner 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.190
 so we do not hesitate already started to 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.170
 fade makeup for really 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.899
 mark a beautiful transition a bridge 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.880
 fade between the two colors I come 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.380
 also blur the edges of the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 makeup with a faded brush 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.160
 hours this one comes from mac's 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.110
 it will really help to soften 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.030
 even more makeup melt it 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.890
 almost in the skin actually for them 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.140
 make it more natural in quotation marks 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.850
 and then with this palette of chirvan 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.370
 ticket which she has a word palette I 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.650
 come to choose this mode a little pastel 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 river that will allow to create a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.569
 best fade between the purple color 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.220
 dark and pinkish color river it's 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.490
 really the color between the two 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.030
 perfect for creating this 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.790
 fondue we are looking for 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.140
 and now with a pencil brush of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.270
 in essence but any 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.970
 will have to do it I come to take a 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.100
 black paint that is matte and very intense 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.020
 missed another life at the level of 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.360
 makeup so above the rating 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.880
 superior to the outer corner I come 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.500
 trace a small fee and I come on the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.989
 extend in the hollow of the eye for 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.790
 create precisely this v this step is going 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.910
 really allow you to create some 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.069
 relief to your look of creating the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.780
 depth to this makeup so that's 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.030
 a very important step and we do not hesitate 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.010
 not really melt the color 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.730
 to not create a black spot either 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.380
 on the eyelid and we can of course 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.000
 give away a little more fluffy 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.400
 to further disseminate the material 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.569
 then I come to take a flat brush 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.069
 and I use farr strand means for 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.100
 even more create depth but 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.500
 by breaking this too black side at 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.600
 from the outer corner of the eyes and finally I 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.290
 I'll finish by putting eyeliner 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.269
 with my favorite eyeliner of the moment that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.090
 is presented to you in the favorite video 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.620
 of January for this look I decided 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.720
 to opt for a liner stroke earlier 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.860
 end to really finish this makeup 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.510
 all finesse 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.230
 so my trick is to place the black 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.480
 low enough to make it easier to trace 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.640
 so I finish this liner feature by 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.500
 a comma dot very very fine for 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.940
 really stay asking the app is 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.459
 this time the trick is to go back 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.370
 the mirror almost at eye level in 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.230
 does that will also facilitate your 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.810
 point of reference to plot the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.459
 comma and now I'm going to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.560
 ring accounts with my break represents 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.239
 of each caramel color and just before 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.410
 the video I had already applied my baby 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.690
 anti-dark circles cream 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.790
 Then I will apply my bloch 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.470
 come from mac and watch this little 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.940
 heart but me it's just too much that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.130
 to crack too much I had to use for 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 this special Valentine's Day video of a 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.020
 pale pink that will really give you 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.180
 good looks and obviously I come 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.340
 curled missiles and put mascara 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.020
 so I put a waterproof mascara for 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.789
 to do well the curve is for them 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.650
 that make-up hold all the 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.850
 evening 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.620
 you can also put some 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.199
 fossils for a more loaded result 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.580
 if you wish and so that's it 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.680
 everything for this look I do not put red 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.530
 lipstick I do not put gloss because 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.090
 that I think of your lover who has 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.350
 not necessarily want to have red to 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.389
 lips or stierli what can I 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.180
 understand so I'm just proposing 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.370
 put lip balm it will be perfect 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.690
 and we go to the hairdressing part then 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.570
 what am I going to do with all 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.979
 his hair I first turn on my iron to 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.720
 the effect and I apply my foam 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.220
 heat protection but I you 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.199
 really advise this one because 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.699
 that it's a weird effect on 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.070
 hair you will see it right away 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.139
 so I use my straightener for 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.840
 make loops then as I want 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.669
 really very flexible thing that is 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.350
 not too defined I even went through and 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.449
 my hair in several sections like 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.960
 can see it I'm doing things pretty 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.960
 freely 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.030
 and here's once the loops are 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.070
 do I bring them back to the front and 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.160
 I become completely unstructured 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.900
 by passing the hand in the loops I 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.080
 really want to have an effect sooner 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.300
 loose and as I do not like having 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.850
 hair at eye level 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.440
 I'm coming to take a lock and I'm going 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.900
 the coiled on itself make a 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.790
 twist in fact and like the hair 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.570
 are curled this dorsal is really going 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.970
 perfectly fit to fix so this 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.830
 wick I'm going to take a black clip 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.500
 very simple I think everyone 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.570
 has a clip of the color of her hair 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.450
 just that I just fixed like 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.120
 sophie and I finish with my polish 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.310
 red china glaze is the rugby pom's 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.350
 so yes red is a classic 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.990
 but what would a Valentine's day be without 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.460
 red color that represents love the 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.110
 passion seduction 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.640
 so even though I chose not to 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.670
 put on my lips never on my 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.710
 nails and as for the 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.390
 clothes joe remy I think a little 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.430
 black dress a classic once again 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.560
 but what I advise you is all 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.210
 to simply wear the garment in 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.530
 which will make you feel better 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.510
 that you want to wear everything 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.480
 simply I have no advice to you 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.010
 give it to that level so that's it 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.840
 now it's up to you to play 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.060
 thank you very much for watching this 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.920
 video I hope she will have pleased you and 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.510
 I wish you to really spend a 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.110
 excellent 120 years 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.340
 whether you are single or in a relationship 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.150
 the important thing is to enjoy life 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.300
 maximum 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.320
 so enjoy it and I tell you to very 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.320
 soon for a next
