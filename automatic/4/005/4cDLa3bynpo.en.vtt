is going for here but it's kind of a
nicer<00:04:03.310> effect<00:04:03.639> than<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:03.939> having<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.419> with

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
nicer effect than just having it with

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
white in general that it's never really

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.200

white<00:04:24.200> in<00:04:24.530> pictures<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.760> know<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.060> always

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
white in pictures you know it's always

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.270 
white in pictures you know it's always
reflecting<00:04:26.810> some<00:04:26.990> color<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.620> mean<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.130> can

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
reflecting some color I mean you can

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.680 
reflecting some color I mean you can
technically<00:04:28.700> make<00:04:28.910> something<00:04:29.210> light<00:04:29.390> but<00:04:29.420> it

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
technically make something light but it

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.750 
technically make something light but it
won't<00:04:29.870> be<00:04:29.960> very<00:04:30.080> exciting<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:30.920> I<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:31.580> use

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
won't be very exciting so I just use

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.050 
won't be very exciting so I just use
like<00:04:31.820> purple<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.680> shadow<00:04:34.010> color<00:04:34.640> from

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
like purple and the shadow color from

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.090 
like purple and the shadow color from
her<00:04:35.210> skin<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.500> bring<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.710> little<00:04:36.860> brown

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
her skin to kind of bring a little brown

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.760 
her skin to kind of bring a little brown
in<00:04:37.310> there<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.960> there's<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.080> show<00:04:39.290> that<00:04:39.320> maybe

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
in there and there's a show that maybe

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.350 
in there and there's a show that maybe
you<00:04:40.160> can<00:04:40.400> kind<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.670> see<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.880> little<00:04:41.090> something

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
you can kind of see a little something

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.900 
you can kind of see a little something
underneath<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.410> again<00:04:42.830> I'm<00:04:43.100> using<00:04:43.130> this<00:04:43.640> much

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
underneath so again I'm using this much

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.420 
underneath so again I'm using this much
tool<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.260> move<00:04:45.470> basically<00:04:46.010> you're<00:04:46.400> just

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
tool to just move basically you're just

layers once I flat out the colors I

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.400 
layers once I flat out the colors I
preserve<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.910> transparency<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.750> my<00:04:53.900> lair<00:04:54.080> so

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.180 
I can just go to town and stay in the
lines<00:04:56.540> when<00:04:57.350> you're<00:04:57.470> doing<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:57.950> want<00:04:58.130> to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
lines when you're doing that you want to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.540 
lines when you're doing that you want to
be<00:04:58.250> careful<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:59.530> you're<00:05:00.530> not<00:05:00.560> pulling<00:05:01.070> in

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
be careful that you're not pulling in

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.640 
be careful that you're not pulling in
absence<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.240> color<00:05:02.480> from<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.140> edges<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.590> know

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
absence of color from the edges I know

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.290 
absence of color from the edges I know
it<00:05:03.800> sounds<00:05:03.950> really<00:05:04.220> weird<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.640> totally<00:05:05.030> hard

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
it sounds really weird and totally hard

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.000 
it sounds really weird and totally hard
to<00:05:05.360> explain<00:05:05.600> just<00:05:05.840> always<00:05:06.410> make<00:05:06.710> sure<00:05:06.740> that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
to explain just always make sure that

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.410 
to explain just always make sure that
you're<00:05:07.130> not<00:05:07.250> cutting<00:05:07.700> into<00:05:08.000> your<00:05:08.030> colors

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
you're not cutting into your colors

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.940 
you're not cutting into your colors
because<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.870> won't<00:05:09.050> go<00:05:09.200> outside<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.770> lines

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
because it won't go outside the lines

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.420 
because it won't go outside the lines
but<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.700> will<00:05:11.350> like<00:05:12.350> lightning<00:05:12.860> things<00:05:13.130> up<00:05:13.310> on

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
but it will like lightning things up on

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.850 
but it will like lightning things up on
the<00:05:13.520> inside<00:05:13.850> as<00:05:14.120> inside<00:05:14.990> kind<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.440> confusing

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
the inside as inside kind of confusing

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.580 
the inside as inside kind of confusing
whatever<00:05:16.160> rendering<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> boots<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.480> wanted<00:05:18.470> it

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
whatever rendering the boots I wanted it

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.380 
whatever rendering the boots I wanted it
to<00:05:18.710> be<00:05:18.830> shiny<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.490> patent<00:05:19.880> leather<00:05:20.090> but<00:05:20.360> I

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
to be shiny like patent leather but I

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.630 
to be shiny like patent leather but I
didn't<00:05:20.750> have<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:20.990> reference<00:05:21.500> for<00:05:21.800> any<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:22.490> this

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
didn't have a reference for any of this

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.159 
didn't have a reference for any of this
stuff<00:05:22.790> so<00:05:23.120> I'm<00:05:23.180> kind<00:05:23.419> of<00:05:23.450> making<00:05:23.660> it<00:05:23.840> up<00:05:23.930> as<00:05:24.050> I

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
stuff so I'm kind of making it up as I

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.670 
stuff so I'm kind of making it up as I
go<00:05:25.270> with<00:05:26.270> really<00:05:26.750> shiny<00:05:26.990> things<00:05:27.260> they<00:05:27.380> usually

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
go with really shiny things they usually

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.580 
go with really shiny things they usually
have<00:05:27.830> like<00:05:27.980> a<00:05:28.870> primary<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.990> secondary<00:05:30.140> light

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
have like a primary to secondary light

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.350 
have like a primary to secondary light
showers<00:05:30.950> kind<00:05:31.640> of<00:05:31.730> bounce<00:05:31.940> things<00:05:32.180> off

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
showers kind of bounce things off

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.060 
showers kind of bounce things off
because<00:05:32.540> it's<00:05:32.840> easier<00:05:33.169> for<00:05:33.230> for<00:05:33.860> shiny

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
because it's easier for for shiny

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.310 
because it's easier for for shiny
materials<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.730> pick<00:05:34.910> up<00:05:35.030> light<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.600> so<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.169> did

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
materials to pick up light so so I did

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.170 
materials to pick up light so so I did
that<00:05:36.500> through<00:05:37.220> a<00:05:37.250> shadow<00:05:37.550> underneath<00:05:37.880> the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
that through a shadow underneath the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.340 
that through a shadow underneath the
girls<00:05:38.510> I<00:05:38.840> use<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:40.660> four<00:05:41.660> part<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.110> shadow

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
girls I use a four part of the shadow

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.430 
girls I use a four part of the shadow
and<00:05:42.680> now<00:05:42.800> I'm<00:05:42.860> doing<00:05:43.130> hair<00:05:43.430> which<00:05:44.210> is<00:05:44.360> fun<00:05:44.690> I'm

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
and now I'm doing hair which is fun I'm

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.930 
and now I'm doing hair which is fun I'm
just<00:05:45.590> sliding<00:05:45.950> up<00:05:46.040> these<00:05:46.190> colors<00:05:46.580> on<00:05:46.700> both<00:05:46.910> of

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
just sliding up these colors on both of

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.330 
just sliding up these colors on both of
them<00:05:47.210> again<00:05:47.600> I've<00:05:47.750> got<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.020> hair<00:05:48.200> layer<00:05:49.010> set

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
them again I've got the hair layer set

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.130 
them again I've got the hair layer set
to<00:05:49.460> preserve<00:05:49.700> transparency<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:50.900> I'm<00:05:50.960> not

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
to preserve transparency so and I'm not

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.630 
to preserve transparency so and I'm not
just<00:05:51.380> making<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.890> big<00:05:52.040> mess<00:05:52.190> all<00:05:52.370> over<00:05:52.430> the

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
just making a big mess all over the

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.850 
just making a big mess all over the
place<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.060> I<00:05:54.020> actually<00:05:54.200> just<00:05:54.530> took<00:05:54.740> the

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
place and I actually just took the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.440 
place and I actually just took the
preserve<00:05:55.130> transparency<00:05:55.400> off<00:05:55.970> because<00:05:56.300> now<00:05:56.419> I

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
preserve transparency off because now I

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.450 
preserve transparency off because now I
may<00:05:56.600> be<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.750> little<00:05:56.780> more<00:05:57.020> careful<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.680> tweak

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
may be a little more careful and tweak

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.550 
may be a little more careful and tweak
the<00:05:58.580> edges<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.390> that<00:05:59.419> everything<00:05:59.780> looks<00:06:00.050> there

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
the edges so that everything looks there

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.120 
the edges so that everything looks there
us<00:06:00.830> being<00:06:01.160> soft<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:01.820> you<00:06:02.360> know<00:06:02.479> it's<00:06:02.690> just

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
us being soft and you know it's just

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.100 
us being soft and you know it's just
kind<00:06:04.130> of<00:06:04.220> a<00:06:04.310> nicer<00:06:04.610> effect<00:06:04.910> then<00:06:05.750> just<00:06:05.960> like

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
kind of a nicer effect then just like

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.969 
kind of a nicer effect then just like
letting<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.740> be<00:06:06.919> all<00:06:07.100> hard<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.760> weird<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:09.200> yeah

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
letting it be all hard and weird so yeah

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.490 
letting it be all hard and weird so yeah
I'm<00:06:10.100> just<00:06:10.220> pulling<00:06:10.640> at<00:06:10.729> the<00:06:10.760> hair<00:06:11.050> as<00:06:12.050> soon<00:06:12.380> as

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
I'm just pulling at the hair as soon as

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.340 
I'm just pulling at the hair as soon as
I<00:06:12.590> get<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:13.130> outline<00:06:13.669> fixed<00:06:14.600> I'm<00:06:14.810> going<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.169> put

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
I get the outline fixed I'm going to put

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.900 
I get the outline fixed I'm going to put
the<00:06:15.500> preserve<00:06:15.800> transparency<00:06:16.070> back<00:06:16.640> on

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
the preserve transparency back on

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.360 
the preserve transparency back on
basically<00:06:17.720> lock<00:06:17.900> my<00:06:18.110> layers<00:06:18.320> show<00:06:18.740> that<00:06:18.979> I'm

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
basically lock my layers show that I'm

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.350 
basically lock my layers show that I'm
you<00:06:20.150> know<00:06:20.180> staying<00:06:20.570> inside<00:06:20.930> these<00:06:21.080> lines<00:06:22.360> so

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
you know staying inside these lines so

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.700 
you know staying inside these lines so
now<00:06:23.479> I'm<00:06:23.600> just<00:06:23.780> moving<00:06:23.900> around<00:06:24.110> highlights

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
now I'm just moving around highlights

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.390 
now I'm just moving around highlights
and<00:06:25.070> trenches<00:06:25.630> again<00:06:26.630> with<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.080> lack<00:06:27.290> of

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
and trenches again with the lack of

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.219 
and trenches again with the lack of
reference<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:29.270> know<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.479> just<00:06:29.660> kind<00:06:30.050> of<00:06:30.140> get

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
reference you know you just kind of get

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.130 
reference you know you just kind of get
to<00:06:30.820> make<00:06:31.820> everything<00:06:32.120> up<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:32.539> try<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:32.930> make<00:06:33.050> it

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
to make everything up and try to make it

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.409 
to make everything up and try to make it
look<00:06:33.260> cool<00:06:33.470> so<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:34.130> have<00:06:34.880> the<00:06:35.060> light<00:06:35.240> source

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
look cool so I have the light source

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.460 
look cool so I have the light source
coming<00:06:35.630> from

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
coming from

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.720 
coming from
no<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.710> front<00:06:38.040> and<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.460> right<00:06:39.050> but<00:06:40.050> again

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
no the front and to the right but again

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.540 
no the front and to the right but again
honestly<00:06:41.730> I<00:06:41.820> I<00:06:42.510> just<00:06:42.990> do<00:06:43.170> it<00:06:43.350> looks<00:06:44.070> cool<00:06:44.310> half

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
honestly I I just do it looks cool half
