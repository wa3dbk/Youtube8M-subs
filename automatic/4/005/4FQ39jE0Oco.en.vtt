00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.560
 partition systems and after two to two 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.269
 the systems of partitions and after the fairies klaus allow the free design in 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.810
 the interior layout 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 the inner lining of a wall by means of after two to two direct a voice 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.109
 consists of facing the wall internally to achieve greater 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.750
 thermal and acoustic insulation 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 there are three types of after 2 to 2 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.990
 the after two to two direct the direct simile and the self-supporting 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.450
 the inner lining of a wall by means of after two to two direct 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.890
 consists of adhering a plasterboard through a plaster material 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.200
 In the first place the stakeout of the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.700
 conventional such as the established plumb line and the marking cord 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.750
 the stakeout 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.120
 marta the future position of the interior construction elements 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.320
 The most modern techniques are laser leveling 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 that allows a high degree of performance 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.820
 Before the installation of the plates, the boxes are opened 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 of mechanisms with a crown drill 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.810
 Once the stakeout is done, the gripping material is mixed 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 when the surface behind the rings is smooth 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.450
 if you will use fujiÃ¡n fuller 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.430
 If the surface of the wall presents irregularities, the gripping material 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.760
 use I hope from the fis 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.810
 this material is mixed with water 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.820
 in a ratio of 12 point five liters of water per 25 kilos of powder 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.730
 adhesive 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.160
 and beat until you get a consistent dough 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.140
 This kneading material is placed on the supporting wall by fighting 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.890
 distributed in grids of approximately 40 by 40 centimeters 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.880
 giving the knobs not enough for the placement of two or three plates 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.939
 then plates are pasted 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.379
 keeping the raised one centimeter from the ground and level 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.239
 hitting them lightly with a rubber hammer until they reach the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.709
 stakeout line 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.869
 Finally 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.489
 we will proceed to the treatment of the boards 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.949
 in order to leave the surface completely smooth to decorate 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.459
 When the wall presents irregularities of more than two centimeters 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.689
 the ad hoc transfer must be carried out using as an auxiliary element a 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.169
 series of plate strips that will be glued to the wall with gripping material 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.470
 and the plates in turn to these strips 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.470
 confucius Ã­nfulas 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.589
 after 2 to 2 in and director 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.999
 It is used when the wall behind 2 April is not adherent or the finish is 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.809
 find in poor condition 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.229
 in these cases the fixation of the plates is done with the profile 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.229
 metallic master omega 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.730
 after rethinking they should mark vertical lines every 60 centimeters 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.730
 that will correspond to the axes of the teachers 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.630
 the teachers are fixed to the wall 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.599
 with screws and studs 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.710
 then 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.859
 the plates are fixed to the profiles with self-drilling screws 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.029
 taking care that they are separated from the ground approximately one centimeter 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.230
 for which we can use a manual table lifter 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.230
 puts an elevated pedal 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.499
 Finally 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.499
 we will proceed to the treatment of joints 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.400
 If you want to get more insulation with rock wool inside 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.029
 a greater leveling in the after the fates 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.239
 it is necessary to resort still after the adopted carriers 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.629
 first, as in any other after the adoption, rethink the line 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.629
 Finishing 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.409
 for good acoustic isolation of the partition 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.870
 on the back of the channel 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.550
 30 by 30 upper and lower 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.790
 the self-adhesive acoustic seal band is fixed 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.830
 these channels are fixed to the ground and the roof 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.039
 taking care that they are in the same vertical by means of a plumed or 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.279
 To be 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.429
 Depending on the nature of the surfaces, tacos can be used 

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:32.409
 expansion 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:33.300
 screws 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.309
 by rivets 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:38.339
 that will be fixed with a maximum separation between one-meter clips 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.969
 Vertical profiles are used by teachers 60 27 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.749
 whose lengths can be adjusted by making a cut in them with 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.769
 a scissors or an electric shear of polite navia 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.110
 These teachers are introduced in the upper and lower channels without 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.240
 screw the 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.849
 with a maximum separation of 60 centimeters between them 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.919
 and should not touch the ceiling, leaving a slack of one as 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.199
 five centimeters on top 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.199
 so that it could dilate before changes in temperature 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.470
 To give liquidity to the structure, each teacher must go to rivers, each meter 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:42.020
 and a half height by means of a steel angle anchored to the wall 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.430
 To achieve a good quality partition it is recommended to use the overthrown 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.409
 Postiva of glass of 40 millimeters of thickness and a density of 30 kilos by 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:05.529
 cubic meter 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.529
 khedira introduced between the vertical profiles 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.879
 once the rock wool is installed, proceed to the tomilla two of the plates 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.710
 taking care that they are not in contact with the ground to prevent the plates 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.699
 absorb moisture 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.529
 the separation between screws must not exceed 25 centimeters 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.559
 nauzet plates 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:34.419
 they are marked with a letter k 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.509
 in the exact place where the screws must be lodged 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:41.360
 by last 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.450
 the joint treatment is carried out
