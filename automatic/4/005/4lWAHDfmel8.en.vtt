lessons and I've always played and it
was<00:00:20.679> actually<00:00:20.980> when<00:00:21.159> I<00:00:21.189> was<00:00:21.339> in<00:00:21.429> college<00:00:21.730> that

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:21.909 
was actually when I was in college that

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.149 
was actually when I was in college that
I<00:00:22.329> kind<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:22.900> just<00:00:22.989> realized<00:00:23.679> one<00:00:23.859> day<00:00:23.890> that<00:00:24.009> I

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:24.159 
I kind of just realized one day that I

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.140 
I kind of just realized one day that I
didn't<00:00:24.460> love<00:00:24.609> it<00:00:24.759> anymore

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
didn't love it anymore

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.470 
didn't love it anymore
and<00:00:25.359> I<00:00:25.569> used<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:26.079> love<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.409> and<00:00:26.619> I<00:00:27.519> specifically

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
and I used to love it and I specifically

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.569 
and I used to love it and I specifically
didn't<00:00:28.929> study<00:00:29.289> music<00:00:29.739> and<00:00:29.890> fool<00:00:30.189> because<00:00:30.399> I

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
didn't study music and fool because I

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.030 
didn't study music and fool because I
didn't<00:00:30.999> ever<00:00:31.210> want<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.599> have<00:00:31.839> the<00:00:32.290> love<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.529> my

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
didn't ever want to have the love of my

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.350 
didn't ever want to have the love of my
music<00:00:33.309> beat<00:00:33.489> out<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.790> me<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.149> kind<00:00:34.329> of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
music beat out of me and so it kind of

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.670 
music beat out of me and so it kind of
broke<00:00:34.540> my<00:00:34.720> heart<00:00:34.960> when<00:00:35.140> I<00:00:35.200> was<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.470> I<00:00:35.620> don't

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.900 
broke my heart when I was like I don't
even<00:00:35.890> enjoy<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.370> anymore

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910
