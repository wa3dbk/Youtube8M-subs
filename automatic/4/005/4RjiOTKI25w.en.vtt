 Now we will turn it on to you more 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.280
 I will tell our caliph about this in detail 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.890

 operating system android 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.690
 now until we turn on see what 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.010
 cortex a7 processor here's a two-liter one 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.100

 supports flash card up to 32 gigabytes 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.690
 as you can see everything is perfectly visible 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.600
 its nuances that can be viewed as 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:22.830
 says RAM 1 gigabyte 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.180
 Now here it is for the camera pictures in it 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.090
 5 megapixels 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.810

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.070

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.919
 Switched bluetooth vayfay 40 and hbs 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.449
 very good comfortable to use not 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.440
 very large not very small average 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.740
 the phone is really middle class but if 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.259
 I would choose between these two 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:56.169
 I would probably choose me 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:06:00.250
 it would be better because in quality and some 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:04.090
 characteristics which by telling yourself 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.759
 about yourself means cortex a-7 and here's the process 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:12.009
 says to yourself yes batteries like 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:17.280
 it says to itself that the camera is better than 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:23.110
 more precisely, the cube is better than lenovo 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.509
 Well, the speed and design is better I would 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.970
 chose elji but this is just mine 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.780
 think as they say yourself 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.430
