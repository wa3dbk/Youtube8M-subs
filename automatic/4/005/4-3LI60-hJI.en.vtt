the<00:00:54.210> cold<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:55.079> leather<00:00:55.559> skirts<00:00:56.399> are

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the cold because leather skirts are

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
the cold because leather skirts are
extremely<00:00:57.510> hot<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.500> goes<00:00:58.739> high<00:00:59.010> waisted<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
extremely hot it goes high waisted so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.130 
extremely hot it goes high waisted so
it's<00:00:59.670> covering<00:01:00.030> part<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.600> stomach<00:01:00.870> which
