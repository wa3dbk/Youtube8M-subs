we<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.370> into<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.610> video<00:00:53.699> any<00:00:54.000> much<00:00:54.150> more

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
we get into the video any much more

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.549 
we get into the video any much more
first<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.019> just<00:00:55.170> want<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.350> say<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
first of all what I just want to say is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
first of all what I just want to say is
if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.430> intro<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.970> start

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
if you like the little intro the start

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.310 
if you like the little intro the start
there<00:00:57.420> let<00:00:57.570> me<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> comments

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there let me know down the comments

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.960 
there let me know down the comments
below<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.190> took<00:00:59.400> me<00:00:59.580> quite<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.879> while

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
below because it took me quite a while

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.610 
below because it took me quite a while
to<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.659> think<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.199> best<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.589> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
to do but I think it's the best way of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.310 
to do but I think it's the best way of
showing<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> gun<00:01:02.339> because<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.909> a<00:01:02.940> six

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
showing off a gun because that was a six

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.540 
showing off a gun because that was a six
killfeed<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.739> split<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.220> someone

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
killfeed I was split because someone

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.580 
killfeed I was split because someone
left<00:01:05.580> again<00:01:05.940> but<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.120> was<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> six-man<00:01:07.200> rapid

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
left again but it was a six-man rapid

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.960 
left again but it was a six-man rapid
kill<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> sm<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> really

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
kill with the sm one I think that really

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
kill with the sm one I think that really
does<00:01:09.270> show<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.720> how<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> gun<00:01:10.230> works<00:01:10.260> besides

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
does show off how the gun works besides

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
does show off how the gun works besides
the<00:01:10.980> gameplay<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> background<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the gameplay in the background and the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.670 
the gameplay in the background and the
game<00:01:12.390> playing<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> background<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
game playing the background is a really

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
game playing the background is a really
fast<00:01:13.979> DNA<00:01:14.460> bomb<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> map<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.120> send<00:01:15.330> with

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
fast DNA bomb on the map of send with

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
fast DNA bomb on the map of send with
the<00:01:15.540> sm<00:01:15.870> one<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> replicated

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the sm one and it's kind of a replicated

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
the sm one and it's kind of a replicated
cluster<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.060> stride<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.690> not<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> speak

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
cluster was the stride and not to speak

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
cluster was the stride and not to speak
easy<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.890> we're<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> covering<00:01:20.400> both

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
easy but we're going to be covering both

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
easy but we're going to be covering both
of<00:01:20.909> those<00:01:21.000> classes<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.840> video<00:01:22.170> so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of those classes in this video so

of those classes in this video so
getting<00:01:22.950> straight<00:01:23.190> into<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.729> I've<00:01:23.850> got

for you guys today is the sweeper
variant<00:01:26.280> we're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.759> replicating

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
variant we're going to be replicating

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
variant we're going to be replicating
Australia<00:01:27.689> first<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.439> sweeper<00:01:28.799> variant<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
Australia first the sweeper variant is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.649 
Australia first the sweeper variant is
actually<00:01:29.490> pretty<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:29.969> it's<00:01:30.119> got<00:01:30.270> plus<00:01:30.479> 1

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
actually pretty good it's got plus 1

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually pretty good it's got plus 1
damage<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.079> management<00:01:31.439> favorite<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
damage and management favorite that's it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
damage and management favorite that's it
that's<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that's all there is to it and I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
that's all there is to it and I
personally<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.950> minus<00:01:35.399> fire<00:01:35.610> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
personally think that the minus fire it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
personally think that the minus fire it
might<00:01:36.000> help<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> bit<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> accuracy

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
might help out a bit with the accuracy

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
might help out a bit with the accuracy
because<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.950> guys<00:01:38.130> don't<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
because if you guys don't know the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
because if you guys don't know the
Strider<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.570> has<00:01:39.689> plus<00:01:39.960> 1<00:01:40.170> damage<00:01:40.380> i'll<00:01:40.619> put<00:01:40.740> on

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
Strider it has plus 1 damage i'll put on

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
Strider it has plus 1 damage i'll put on
screen<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> s<00:01:41.520> plus<00:01:41.729> 1<00:01:41.820> damage<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
screen right now it s plus 1 damage it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.499 
screen right now it s plus 1 damage it
has<00:01:42.689> minus<00:01:43.200> 3<00:01:43.770> accuracy<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
has minus 3 accuracy which is a bit of a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
has minus 3 accuracy which is a bit of a
bummer<00:01:45.719> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:46.530> plus<00:01:46.799> 2<00:01:46.950> range<00:01:47.250> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
bummer and then it has plus 2 range so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.459 
bummer and then it has plus 2 range so
it's<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.509> gun<00:01:48.719> it<00:01:48.869> packs<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.289> pretty

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
it's a pretty good gun it packs a pretty

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.499 
it's a pretty good gun it packs a pretty
big<00:01:49.799> punch<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.250> terms<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> damage<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.359> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
big punch in terms of damage but that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
big punch in terms of damage but that
accuracy<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.079> lets<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.039> think

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
accuracy just lets it down and I think

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.440 
accuracy just lets it down and I think
it's<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.609> of<00:01:53.700> those<00:01:53.759> guns<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.119> you'd<00:01:54.270> want

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it's one of those guns that you'd want

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.120 
it's one of those guns that you'd want
to<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> map<00:01:55.109> like<00:01:55.229> Detroit<00:01:55.649> rather<00:01:55.890> than

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to use on a map like Detroit rather than

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
to use on a map like Detroit rather than
going<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.579> long-range<00:01:56.909> kills<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.329> instinct

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
going for long-range kills on instinct

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
going for long-range kills on instinct
however<00:01:58.079> today<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.280> got<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
however today I have actually got a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
however today I have actually got a
class<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.479> better<00:02:00.689> than<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
class that I think is better than the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
class that I think is better than the
Strider<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.409> can't<00:02:01.740> normally<00:02:02.070> fan<00:02:02.280> guns<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
Strider I can't normally fan guns that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.740 
Strider I can't normally fan guns that
are<00:02:02.729> actually<00:02:03.000> better<00:02:03.119> than<00:02:03.240> their<00:02:03.509> elite

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
are actually better than their elite

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.690 
are actually better than their elite

we're<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.430> looking<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.850> all<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
we're going to be looking at that all it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.570 
we're going to be looking at that all it
does<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> plus<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.260> damage<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.860> minus<00:02:17.250> 1

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
does is a plus one damage and minus 1

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.640 
does is a plus one damage and minus 1
fire<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.270> think<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.780> isn't<00:02:18.990> honestly<00:02:19.470> too

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
fire it I think that isn't honestly too

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.990 
fire it I think that isn't honestly too
much<00:02:19.890> because<00:02:20.100> all<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.460> needed<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.850> really

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
much because all we needed to really

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
much because all we needed to really
replicate<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> class<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> plus<00:02:22.860> 1

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
replicate the class was that plus 1

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.080 
replicate the class was that plus 1
damage<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.610> can<00:02:23.730> put<00:02:23.850> advanced

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
damage because you can put advanced

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.520 
damage because you can put advanced
rifle<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.630> unlike<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.960> can<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.230> I've<00:02:25.350> got<00:02:25.380> on

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
rifle and unlike you can see I've got on

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.960 
rifle and unlike you can see I've got on
the<00:02:25.620> attachments<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:26.940> i

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the attachments there and then all i

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.490 
the attachments there and then all i
really<00:02:27.360> need<00:02:27.600> after<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.110> forward

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
really need after that is forward

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.869 
really need after that is forward
because<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.830> i<00:02:28.950> said<00:02:28.980> i<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.550> accuracy

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
because like i said i like my accuracy

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.000 
because like i said i like my accuracy
and<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:30.599> making<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.110> accuracy<00:02:31.470> even<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and that's making the accuracy even that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.350 
and that's making the accuracy even that
just<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> little<00:02:32.459> bit<00:02:32.550> better<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.090> far<00:02:33.300> as

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
just a little bit better so as far as

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.940 
just a little bit better so as far as
replicating<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.989> stradder<00:02:34.290> comes<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.709> more

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
replicating the stradder comes in more

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.229 
replicating the stradder comes in more
sit<00:02:35.220> we've<00:02:35.340> done<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.670> we've<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
sit we've done it we've got all the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.550 
sit we've done it we've got all the
attachments<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.780> need<00:02:36.930> we've<00:02:37.140> got<00:02:37.260> everything

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.780 
attachments we need we've got everything
to<00:02:37.770> make<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> little<00:02:38.550> bit<00:02:38.670> better

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
to make it that just a little bit better

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.490 
to make it that just a little bit better
so<00:02:39.269> now<00:02:39.360> i'm<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> show<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.019> guys<00:02:40.140> the

off world at war and that was really

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.680 
off world at war and that was really
hard<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.670> replicate<00:03:38.880> because<00:03:39.299> if<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.510> didn't

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
hard to replicate because if you didn't

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.539 
hard to replicate because if you didn't
know<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.200> isn't<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> attachments<00:03:41.519> that

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
know it isn't just the attachments that

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.979 
know it isn't just the attachments that
are<00:03:41.639> replicated<00:03:42.180> built<00:03:42.329> into<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.630> gun<00:03:42.780> it's

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
are replicated built into the gun it's

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.479 
are replicated built into the gun it's
just<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.319> very<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.769> gun<00:03:43.889> itself<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.280> plus

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
just the very of the gun itself as plus

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.039 
just the very of the gun itself as plus
to<00:03:44.639> fire<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.060> which<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.299> kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.720> rapid

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
to fire it which is kind of like rapid

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.960 
to fire it which is kind of like rapid
fire<00:03:46.230> being<00:03:46.829> built<00:03:46.920> into<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.519> gun<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.880> then

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
fire being built into the gun and then

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.430 
fire being built into the gun and then
it's<00:03:48.090> got<00:03:48.209> an<00:03:48.299> attachment<00:03:48.480> built<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.200> with<00:03:49.350> it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
it's got an attachment built in with it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.840 
it's got an attachment built in with it
as<00:03:49.530> well<00:03:49.680> which<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.100> extended<00:03:50.430> match<00:03:50.639> so

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
as well which is the extended match so

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.340 
as well which is the extended match so
like<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.090> said<00:03:51.209> before<00:03:51.329> guys<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.870> was<00:03:51.989> really

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
like I said before guys this was really

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.599 
like I said before guys this was really
hard<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> replicate<00:03:52.769> because<00:03:53.220> none<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
hard to replicate because none of the

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.280 
hard to replicate because none of the
classes<00:03:53.819> are<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.150> variants<00:03:54.720> for<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:54.959> gun<00:03:55.170> in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
classes are the variants for this gun in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
classes are the variants for this gun in
that<00:03:55.410> man<00:03:55.590> don't<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.519> anything<00:03:56.819> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
that man don't have really anything that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.250 
that man don't have really anything that
the<00:03:57.090> speakings<00:03:57.540> he<00:03:57.690> has<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> offer<00:03:58.079> because

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
the speakings he has to offer because

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.420 
the speakings he has to offer because
the<00:03:58.470> gun<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:59.100> good<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.370> really

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the gun is really good and really

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.550 
the gun is really good and really
overused<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.120> really<00:04:00.359> overpowered<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.290> if

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
overused and really overpowered so if

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.720 
overused and really overpowered so if
you<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:01.799> see<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.040> screen<00:04:02.130> right<00:04:02.280> now<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
you can see on screen right now I

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.120 
you can see on screen right now I
replicated<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.600> class<00:04:03.930> up<00:04:04.230> using<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.799> rigor

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
replicated this class up using the rigor

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.370 
replicated this class up using the rigor
and<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.519> rigor<00:04:05.730> as<00:04:05.970> plus<00:04:06.359> two<00:04:06.569> accuracy<00:04:07.139> built

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
and the rigor as plus two accuracy built

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.690 
and the rigor as plus two accuracy built
in<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.190> said<00:04:08.280> before<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.639> think

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
in and like I said before I think

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.520 
in and like I said before I think
accuracy<00:04:09.389> is<00:04:09.420> key<00:04:09.660> with<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.870> asn.1<00:04:10.230> because

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
accuracy is key with the asn.1 because

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.229 
accuracy is key with the asn.1 because
there<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.130> point<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:11.670> game<00:04:11.730> play<00:04:12.090> where

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
there is a point in this game play where

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.460 
there is a point in this game play where
I<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.420> out<00:04:12.510> gun<00:04:12.720> just<00:04:13.019> cuz<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.230> didn't<00:04:13.380> learn

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
I get out gun just cuz I didn't learn

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.569 
I get out gun just cuz I didn't learn
their<00:04:13.620> shots<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.100> happens<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.430> lot<00:04:14.519> in

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
their shots and that happens a lot in

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.219 
their shots and that happens a lot in
advance<00:04:14.760> warfare<00:04:15.329> if<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.780> playing<00:04:16.019> against

three attachments on the gun and those
three<00:04:33.599> attachments<00:04:34.080> our<00:04:34.229> rapid<00:04:34.530> fire

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
extended mags and for grip as you can

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.879 
extended mags and for grip as you can
see<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.389> screen<00:04:36.479> for<00:04:37.229> grip<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
see on the screen for grip just to

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.710 
see on the screen for grip just to
replicate<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.520> accuracy<00:04:39.000> even<00:04:39.030> more<00:04:39.570> because

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
replicate the accuracy even more because

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.659 
replicate the accuracy even more because
if<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.169> got<00:04:40.349> rapid<00:04:40.830> phone<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.250> puts<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.639> down

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
if you got rapid phone it puts it down

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.029 
if you got rapid phone it puts it down
so<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.419> ill<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.020> can<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.380> counteract<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
so that ill just can to counteract the

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.649 
so that ill just can to counteract the
plus<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.460> accuracy<00:04:44.820> already<00:04:45.210> has<00:04:45.330> on<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.510> gun

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
plus to accuracy already has on the gun

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.180 
plus to accuracy already has on the gun
and<00:04:45.810> then<00:04:46.260> extended<00:04:46.710> mags<00:04:46.860> will<00:04:46.979> replicate

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
and then extended mags will replicate

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.940 
and then extended mags will replicate
the<00:04:47.640> drill

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
the drill

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.850 
the drill
the<00:04:48.460> speakeasy<00:04:48.910> has<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.630> overall<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.500> log

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
the speakeasy has so overall the log

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
the speakeasy has so overall the log
grip<00:04:50.890> on<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.250> gun<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.490> just<00:04:51.640> like<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.850> icing

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
grip on the gun is just like the icing

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.580 
grip on the gun is just like the icing

just to make the gun that very much

shooting<00:05:34.090> fish<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:34.390> a<00:05:34.510> barrel<00:05:34.540> but<00:05:34.870> also<00:05:35.020> we

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
shooting fish in a barrel but also we

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.990 
shooting fish in a barrel but also we
have<00:05:35.470> an<00:05:35.560> XO<00:05:35.770> ability<00:05:36.100> on<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.310> class<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.700> I

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.400 
have an XO ability on this class and I
think<00:05:37.210> this<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.390> kind<00:05:37.540> of<00:05:37.660> important<00:05:38.110> as<00:05:38.200> well

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410

think this is kind of important as well
because<00:05:38.440> when<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.920> use<00:05:39.040> in<00:05:39.160> this<00:05:39.220> class<00:05:39.430> you

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460
