obviously<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> pretty<00:00:20.880> big<00:00:21.119> recovery

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
obviously we have a pretty big recovery

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.790 
obviously we have a pretty big recovery
that's<00:00:21.840> taking<00:00:22.080> place<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> United<00:00:22.769> States

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that's taking place in the United States

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
that's taking place in the United States
as<00:00:23.189> well<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.460> globally<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> United

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
as well as globally for the United

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.029 
as well as globally for the United
States<00:00:25.050> were<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:25.590> looking<00:00:25.740> at

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
States were actually looking at

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.279 
States were actually looking at
transaction<00:00:26.730> volume<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> hit<00:00:27.330> about<00:00:27.539> 7.4

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
transaction volume to hit about 7.4

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
transaction volume to hit about 7.4
billion<00:00:28.560> dollars<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.310> year<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.580> date<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.060> that's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
billion dollars a year to date so that's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640 
billion dollars a year to date so that's
a<00:00:30.330> pretty<00:00:30.480> big<00:00:30.660> increase<00:00:31.050> over<00:00:31.289> last<00:00:31.320> year

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a pretty big increase over last year

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.319 
a pretty big increase over last year
it's<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> hundred<00:00:32.910> eighty<00:00:33.149> percent

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it's about a hundred eighty percent

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.850 
it's about a hundred eighty percent
increase<00:00:33.780> over<00:00:34.020> last<00:00:34.050> year<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> thing

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
increase over last year and the thing

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500 
increase over last year and the thing
that's<00:00:34.890> important<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> note<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.149> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's important to note here is that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's important to note here is that
that<00:00:36.780> only<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.469> captures<00:00:37.920> transactions

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that only really captures transactions

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
that only really captures transactions
of<00:00:38.760> 10<00:00:38.940> million<00:00:39.120> dollars<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.600> above<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of 10 million dollars or above so

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.780 
of 10 million dollars or above so
there's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> number<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.920> other<00:00:41.100> transactions

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
there's a number of other transactions

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
there's a number of other transactions
that<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> increased<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.480> well<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that have increased as well but it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
that have increased as well but it
certainly<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:43.980> good<00:00:44.280> testament

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
certainly is a very very good testament

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
certainly is a very very good testament
in<00:00:44.879> terms<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> velocity<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> recovery

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
in terms of the velocity of the recovery

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630 
in terms of the velocity of the recovery
we're<00:00:46.379> seeing<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> States<00:00:47.010> what's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we're seeing in the States what's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
we're seeing in the States what's
encouraging<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.750> driving

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
encouraging so what is really driving

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
encouraging so what is really driving
the<00:00:49.289> influx<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> transaction<00:00:50.640> activity

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the influx in this transaction activity

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
the influx in this transaction activity
yeah<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.719> what's<00:00:51.960> driving<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> influx<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
yeah i mean what's driving the influx is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
yeah i mean what's driving the influx is
it's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> number<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.579> things<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it's a number of things we're kind of in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
it's a number of things we're kind of in
a<00:00:54.360> perfect<00:00:54.719> storm<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.309> hit<00:00:56.460> a

a perfect storm right now okay we hit a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
a perfect storm right now okay we hit a
trough<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.030> terms<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> operating

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
trough in terms of operating

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
trough in terms of operating
fundamentals<00:00:58.410> Noi<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> hit<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
fundamentals Noi is kind of hit the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
fundamentals Noi is kind of hit the

it's<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> created<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> perfect

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it's really kind of created a perfect

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
it's really kind of created a perfect
storm<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.450> terms<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> transaction<00:01:25.290> volume<00:01:25.560> at

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
storm in terms of transaction volume at

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
storm in terms of transaction volume at
least<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> hotel<00:01:26.280> space<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
least in the hotel space so will that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
least in the hotel space so will that
storm<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.080> increased<00:01:28.409> liquidity<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.070> more

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
storm of increased liquidity and more

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
storm of increased liquidity and more
people<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:30.090> actively<00:01:30.600> buying<00:01:31.020> mean<00:01:31.470> at

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
people really actively buying mean at

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
people really actively buying mean at
the<00:01:31.799> year-end<00:01:32.100> 2011<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.329> back<00:01:33.509> at

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the year-end 2011 is going to be back at

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
the year-end 2011 is going to be back at
like<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> very<00:01:34.439> robust<00:01:34.860> pace<00:01:35.100> yeah<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> know

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
like a very robust pace yeah you know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
like a very robust pace yeah you know
initially<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.509> came<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> year<00:01:37.020> we

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
initially when we came out this year we

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
initially when we came out this year we
predicted<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> transaction<00:01:38.729> volume<00:01:39.000> would

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
predicted that transaction volume would

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.609 
predicted that transaction volume would
hit<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.390> 13<00:01:39.810> billion<00:01:40.020> dollars<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
hit about 13 billion dollars in the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
hit about 13 billion dollars in the
United<00:01:40.890> States<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.759> had<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> lot<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> people

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
United States we had a lot of people
kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> chuckle<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> thinking<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.979> were

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
kind of chuckle at that thinking we were

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
kind of chuckle at that thinking we were
very<00:01:44.280> aggressive<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:45.000> fact<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.750> we've

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
very aggressive in fact now we've

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
very aggressive in fact now we've
revised<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> upward<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.220> 16<00:01:47.700> billion

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
revised that upward to about 16 billion

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
out of bankruptcy which that alone will

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
out of bankruptcy which that alone will
be<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.009> point<00:01:59.189> 13<00:01:59.670> billion<00:01:59.939> dollar

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180

want to play so yeah I think we will see
and<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.640> will<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> trend<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.270> will

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and it will be a trend that will

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.910 
and it will be a trend that will
continue<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.960> see<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> number<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.590> larger

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
continue will see a number of larger

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470 
continue will see a number of larger
transactions<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.730> announced<00:02:23.970> between<00:02:24.240> now
