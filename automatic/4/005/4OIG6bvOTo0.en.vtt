00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.620
 Real Madrid won by 4 goals to 2 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.630
 to club osasuna athletic at the meeting 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.969
 that put the end to the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.059
 2012-2013 season in the bbva league 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.680
 both for whites and reds a 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.720
 madrid that arrived the last day with 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.910
 the second position secured with team 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.590
 osasuna that the previous day had 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.599
 tied the permanence in the first 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.150
 Spanish football division 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.339
 mourinho center a part of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.850
 prominence since it was the last one 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:37.870
 that he directed as Madrid coach 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.870
 and the dispute between some fans and others 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.879
 some applauding their work others removing 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.470
 his job as coach of Real Madrid 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.600
 It was probably the most newsworthy 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.500
 over about 90 minutes in a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 party that at times resembled more a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 colorful preseason meeting that the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 official match 04 that started with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.510
 some controversy because 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.089
 companions 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.630
 that the graphic press took too long 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.700
 weather 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.770
 in leaving the field they wanted 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.549
 take a photo the last photo to mourinho 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 on the bench of madrid 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 and they stayed when the game had already 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.110
 started many absences in the eleven 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.110
 initial of one and another team 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.440
 alternative alignments and first 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.460
 opportunity for osasuna with that auction 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.460
 from joseba llorente 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.780
 more than osasuna in that hand in hand that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 jesus who was the goalkeeper 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.549
 they rejected the shot of emiliano 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.549
 armenteros 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.180
 and in this maneuver with just wine I was going to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 score the first goal of the contest 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.310
 because I did not even celebrate 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.280
 the pipita that carried the bracelet of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.890
 captain and that speculations place 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.780
 that next season will not be 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 in Madrid but defending the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.290
 colors of juventus we will see what is it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.450
 what happens from now on in this 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 period that opens of departures and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.640
 tickets in all the clubs in the league 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.980
 bbv to corner kick and second goal of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.980
 I find the auction of 100 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.370
 probability will abandon the discipline 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.300
 del madrid that arrived last summer 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.300
 ceded by chelsea 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.890
 this way marked his second goal of 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.380
 course beating for that testarazo 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.090
 well the risk 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.090
 today I was dedicating you to jose mourinho 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 images of the second half a boot 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 of second time where he dominated osasuna and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.000
 where the mendilibar team was going to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.810
 get balance the party first 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.760
 with this great goal 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.120
 by roberto torres 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.280
 a kid who has simultaneed 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.590
 the first team with the subsidiary on 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 all been in the subsidiary and that marked 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.099
 this great goal beating with that right 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.099
 to jesus 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.340
 and osasuna and even go to get 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.459
 tie the center duel to the area 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.560
 high auction of emiliano armenteros was 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.180
 better the mendÃ­libar team in the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.180
 Initial stretch of the second half 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.860
 excellent opportunity of this de jose 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.750
 by hand 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.750
 and the mitten of risk 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:01.190
 prevented the goal of Real Madrid 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.710
 Here load 100 to silva 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.000
 the referee indicated a lack but should 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.220
 have indicated penalty since the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.990
 repetition to be able to check how the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.410
 infringement occurs inside the 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.410
 Madrid area 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.410
 and this is the goal of the draw of osasuna 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.880
 the goal of Ã¡lvaro cejudo his third bullseye 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.960
 of the season in that game that was coming 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.020
 to mark the sevilla 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.870
 the goal of victory the victory that 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.789
 He tied the continuity of the team 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.039
 pamplona in the bbva league and of this 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.039
 way marked the tie at two 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.650
 and will react however the madrid 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.370
 that was going to end up taking the three 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.669
 first points this goal of karim's 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.669
 over 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.770
 in the movement that is going to make the 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.510
 French to overcome Ruben and the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.610
 shot of benzema that managed to touch him 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.470
 this is risk but in a way the shock 7 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.860
 risk that was to be replaced should 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.720
 ricardo enter his place and saying goodbye 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.820
 of professional football beating in addition 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.150
 the record being 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.980
 oldest player 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.810
 a match in the first division of 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.090
 Spanish football and alley in this way 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.340
 between the legs because it opens the 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.340
 minute 86 64 to 2 definitive 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.040
 Repeat the action as will 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.650
 hold the karim benzema ball like you 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.009
 going to unfold alley and like the 21 of 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.199
 the white ones marked 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.360
 the final 4 to 2 the land that 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.069
 closed the game of the season 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.199
 love and I finally applauded the fans 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:51.069
 in the true end of season madrid 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.069
 4 osasuna 2
