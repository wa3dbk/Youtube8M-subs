the nail I have prostitute under the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.330 
the nail I have prostitute under the
clear<00:01:11.890> acrylic<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.689> see<00:01:13.869> how<00:01:14.049> it's<00:01:14.830> affected

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
clear acrylic to see how it's affected

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.880

the<00:01:15.460> shine<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:16.000> these<00:01:16.210> or<00:01:16.840> whether<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.710> just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
the shine of these or whether to just

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.050 
the shine of these or whether to just
use<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.810> UV<00:01:20.080> topcoat<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.920> I've<00:01:21.460> found<00:01:21.670> that

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
use the UV topcoat and I've found that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.830 
use the UV topcoat and I've found that
using<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:23.020> UV<00:01:23.320> topcoat<00:01:24.040> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.360> top<00:01:25.570> and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
using the UV topcoat on the top and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
using the UV topcoat on the top and
sealing<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.920> edges<00:01:27.009> are<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.299> best<00:01:28.509> way<00:01:28.720> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
sealing the edges are the best way so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.109 
sealing the edges are the best way so
from<00:01:30.670> there<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.820> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.150> do<00:01:34.270> those<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:36.119> I'm
