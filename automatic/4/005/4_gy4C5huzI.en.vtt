00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
I think they look pretty dumb I mean if

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.980 
I think they look pretty dumb I mean if
your<00:01:07.550> objective<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.270> have<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> Jeep<00:01:08.750> that

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
your objective is to have a Jeep that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.340 
your objective is to have a Jeep that
just<00:01:09.410> looks<00:01:09.619> pretty<00:01:10.060> go<00:01:11.060> ahead<00:01:11.330> but<00:01:11.720> I<00:01:11.960> just

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
just looks pretty go ahead but I just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.389 
just looks pretty go ahead but I just
think<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:12.680> better<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.190> something

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
think it's better to have something
