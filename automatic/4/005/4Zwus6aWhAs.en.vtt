 in a race and that more background 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.090
 penalties good when we have the race 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.120
 we have to put standard type number 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.640
 of laps two classes super time of day 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.500
 morning clear weather traffic and 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.079
 search levels well vehicle your 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.770
 a record we will have to replenish record 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 staff will only staff you put it 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 and we ended up configured just that what 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.890
 we invite a friend can be done with 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.590
 two and three friends I've seen it myself and I've 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.770
 done well now what we have to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.140
 do let's give it 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.020
 I see you inviting my friend and he makes 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.230
 a level 99 good and we take the car that 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.500
 I wanted to commit myself to this for 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.500
 to play 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.210
 and we give him 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.010
 what we have to do is the one that creates 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.659
 the game always has to go second 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.450
 in the first round you have to take the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.490
 role of the player's player first if 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.020
 comes second first does not matter what 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.520
 apart you always have to go second in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.740
 the first round as I'm watching 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.979
 we stick to leave I leave it to my friend 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.119
 go out and I'll take the slipstream I'll 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.820
 let it accelerate and catch the slipstream 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.650
 let's see what I leave there will put me 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.360
 slipstream to slipstream five seconds then 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.560
 means that I want reduced during 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.910
 five seconds then we can already 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.520
 accelerate and I think a little bit of 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.950
 slipstream and we make it look good 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 we continue we make the first round in the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.280
 first round always where the second 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 and I do not care if it goes to the second first 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.470
 that is the same and they will give us four thousand 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.000
 experience points and then 750,000 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.130
 It depends on the position we want in 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.979
 the second round you see it in my hand now 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.050
 same 4800 experience sometimes at 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.490
 4000 to decide less I do not know sometimes the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.520
 truth is that it's a little bit because 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.140
 access less and more or we are not here 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.119
 and the second round, we can already 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.850
 to be first second and that as 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.550
 Will ye 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.890
 we will win 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 another in 4,800 when you go through the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 first for the first goal as well 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.120
 in the game and so again and again everything 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.770
 the other the same who creates the game 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.480
 has x second the first round 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.980
 always second and taking a little bit of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.650
 reduced in the beginning and already after 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.540
 they can run and nothing else I hope 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.550
