00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
Here I am still in quite exciting

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.860 
Here I am still in quite exciting
because<00:00:34.899> it's<00:00:35.350> more<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.180> technology<00:00:37.180> side<00:00:37.420> of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
because it's more the technology side of

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.740 
because it's more the technology side of
my<00:00:38.170> head<00:00:38.440> let's<00:00:38.829> say<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.340> it<00:00:40.239> needs<00:00:40.449> to<00:00:40.600> be

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
my head let's say and it needs to be

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.930 
my head let's say and it needs to be
imbued<00:00:41.050> with<00:00:41.140> lifestyle<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.370> sports

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
imbued with lifestyle and sports

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.270

performance<00:00:43.719> so<00:00:44.050> there's<00:00:44.739> actually<00:00:44.920> no

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
performance so there's actually no

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.549 
performance so there's actually no
conflict<00:00:45.789> with<00:00:45.910> my<00:00:46.000> own<00:00:46.179> collection<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.530> I

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
conflict with my own collection so I

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
conflict with my own collection so I
think<00:00:47.769> it's<00:00:48.070> we're<00:00:48.910> on<00:00:48.969> an<00:00:49.090> exciting<00:00:49.359> journey

what<00:00:53.050> happens<00:00:53.379> in<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:53.739> scenario<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:54.219> this

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
what happens in a scenario like this

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.180
