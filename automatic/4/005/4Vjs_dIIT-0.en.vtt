00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
the search functions to you I'm gonna

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.009 
the search functions to you I'm gonna
have<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.130> show<00:00:28.340> you<00:00:28.400> what<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:29.119> searches<00:00:29.599> for

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
and explain what that is that's what

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
little detour this won't actually be a

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.329 
little detour this won't actually be a
search<00:00:35.660> function<00:00:35.989> but<00:00:36.589> it<00:00:36.680> will<00:00:36.739> explain

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
search function but it will explain

so<00:06:01.790> there's<00:06:01.970> different<00:06:02.120> colored<00:06:05.050> kind<00:06:06.050> of

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
so there's different colored kind of

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.070 
so there's different colored kind of

so all the different colors mean
different<00:06:12.080> things<00:06:12.560> but<00:06:13.340> what's<00:06:13.550> most

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
different things but what's most

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.850 
different things but what's most
important<00:06:14.240> about<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:14.930> that<00:06:15.590> these<00:06:15.800> are

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
important about this is that these are

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.190 
important about this is that these are
