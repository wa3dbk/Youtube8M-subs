race<00:00:22.470> girl<00:00:22.800> tag<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.340> she<00:00:23.580> did<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> i<00:00:24.150> thought

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
race girl tag that she did and i thought

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.179 
race girl tag that she did and i thought
it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:24.720> interesting<00:00:24.900> because<00:00:25.260> i<00:00:25.920> can

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it was really interesting because i can

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.679 
it was really interesting because i can
relate<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> i<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> questions

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
relate to it and i think the questions

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
relate to it and i think the questions

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
really particular but I am actually my

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
really particular but I am actually my
dad<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.270> Lebanon<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
dad is from Lebanon so that you can

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.180 
dad is from Lebanon so that you can
consider<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> Asia<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.199> Arab<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.010> guess

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

you could say and my mom is from
Argentina<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> makes<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.370> a<00:01:00.079> Latino

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
Argentina so that makes me have a Latino

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.609 
Argentina so that makes me have a Latino
so<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> am<00:01:01.649> Arab<00:01:01.980> penalty<00:01:02.370> no<00:01:02.430> well<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.090 
know I don't look like that
second<00:01:07.609> question<00:01:07.960> what<00:01:08.960> ethnicity<00:01:09.439> have<00:01:09.950> you

second question what ethnicity have you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.940 
second question what ethnicity have you
often<00:01:10.670> been<00:01:10.880> mistaken<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:12.380> lot<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:12.859> people

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
often been mistaken a lot of people

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.889 
often been mistaken a lot of people
think<00:01:13.640> I'm<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.990> normal<00:01:15.770> Canadian<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.570> lot

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
think I'm just normal Canadian but a lot

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.749 
think I'm just normal Canadian but a lot
of<00:01:17.929> people<00:01:18.049> do<00:01:18.439> take<00:01:18.710> me<00:01:18.890> for<00:01:19.100> either<00:01:19.310> Greek<00:01:19.729> or

of people do take me for either Greek or

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.840 
of people do take me for either Greek or
English<00:01:20.770> but<00:01:21.770> I'm<00:01:22.069> thinking<00:01:22.429> that's<00:01:22.549> more

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
English but I'm thinking that's more

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.850 
English but I'm thinking that's more
because<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.149> my<00:01:23.329> accident<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:24.020> don't<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:24.710> it

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
because of my accident I don't have it

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.770 
because of my accident I don't have it
very<00:01:25.039> I<00:01:25.429> don't<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.909> Canadian<00:01:26.329> accent<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
very I don't have a Canadian accent and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.830 
very I don't have a Canadian accent and
I'll<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.020> an<00:01:27.229> American<00:01:27.679> accent<00:01:28.069> well<00:01:28.840> you

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'll have an American accent well you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.669 
I'll have an American accent well you
can<00:01:30.020> get<00:01:30.140> some<00:01:30.259> hints<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.950> obviously<00:01:31.280> but

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
can get some hints of it obviously but

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.940 
can get some hints of it obviously but
you<00:01:33.679> pronounce<00:01:34.009> some<00:01:34.130> words<00:01:34.270> quite<00:01:35.270> weird<00:01:35.950> but

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
you pronounce some words quite weird but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.130 
you pronounce some words quite weird but
that's<00:01:37.179> that's<00:01:38.179> just<00:01:38.479> because<00:01:38.600> English<00:01:39.110> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's that's just because English is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.889 
that's that's just because English is
not<00:01:39.259> my<00:01:39.439> first<00:01:39.560> language<00:01:40.090> no<00:01:41.090> one<00:01:41.270> no<00:01:41.599> one<00:01:41.720> has

honest it wasn't really challenging it
was<00:02:09.349> maybe<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.890> weird<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:10.429> I

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
was maybe a little weird because I

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.729 
was maybe a little weird because I
didn't<00:02:11.090> grow<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.239> around<00:02:11.480> my<00:02:11.750> family<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.560> was

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
didn't grow up around my family that was

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.759 
didn't grow up around my family that was
a<00:02:12.769> little<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.100> harder<00:02:13.489> fog<00:02:14.329> which<00:02:15.230> background

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
a little bit harder fog which background

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.550 
a little bit harder fog which background
do<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:15.980> embrace<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.760> most<00:02:17.290> I'm<00:02:18.290> obviously

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
do you embrace the most I'm obviously

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.140 
do you embrace the most I'm obviously
not<00:02:18.799> going<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.190> say<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> prefer<00:02:19.819> one<00:02:20.030> or

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
not going to say that I prefer one or

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.030 
not going to say that I prefer one or
another<00:02:20.209> because<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.930> couldn't<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.350> choose

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
another because I couldn't really choose

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.650 
another because I couldn't really choose
one<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.489> another<00:02:22.579> I<00:02:22.910> mean<00:02:23.120> they're<00:02:23.239> both<00:02:23.389> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
one or another I mean they're both a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.930 
one or another I mean they're both a
part<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.049> me<00:02:24.170> um<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:25.069> do<00:02:25.250> feel<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.549> little<00:02:25.790> bit

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
part of me um I do feel a little bit

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.370 
part of me um I do feel a little bit
more<00:02:27.130> comfortable<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.370> related<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.030> my<00:02:29.989> Latino

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
more comfortable or related to my Latino

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.640 
more comfortable or related to my Latino
side<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:30.859> argentinian<00:02:31.549> side<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.650> that's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
side my argentinian side and that's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.360 
side my argentinian side and that's
probably<00:02:33.859> because<00:02:34.420> i<00:02:35.420> don't<00:02:36.019> speak<00:02:36.079> arab<00:02:36.530> so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
probably because i don't speak arab so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
probably because i don't speak arab so
it<00:02:37.579> is<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> little<00:02:37.819> bit<00:02:38.060> harder<00:02:38.359> for<00:02:38.510> me<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.810> bond

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it is a little bit harder for me to bond

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
it is a little bit harder for me to bond
with<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.500> culture<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.580> speak<00:02:41.849> Spanish<00:02:42.239> so

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
with that culture I do speak Spanish so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750 
with that culture I do speak Spanish so
that's<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.810> guess<00:02:43.049> that's<00:02:43.379> why<00:02:43.590> have<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.579> little

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that's I guess that's why have a little

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640 
that's I guess that's why have a little
bit<00:02:44.879> more<00:02:45.000> connection<00:02:45.540> towards<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.049> side<00:02:46.349> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
bit more connection towards that side of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.130 
bit more connection towards that side of
my<00:02:47.459> head<00:02:47.760> ethnic<00:02:48.510> background<00:02:49.640> six<00:02:51.019> have<00:02:52.019> you

my head ethnic background six have you
ever<00:02:52.290> been<00:02:52.470> teased<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.010> being<00:02:53.069> different<00:02:53.430> I

a<00:03:29.519> cool<00:03:29.700> thing<00:03:29.760> actually<00:03:30.209> has<00:03:30.870> been<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.139> little

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
a cool thing actually has been a little

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.140 
a cool thing actually has been a little
bit<00:03:31.470> weird<00:03:31.739> sometimes<00:03:32.010> because<00:03:32.579> your<00:03:32.730> friends

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
bit weird sometimes because your friends

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.580 
bit weird sometimes because your friends
may<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.139> understand<00:03:34.950> what<00:03:35.959> like<00:03:36.959> how<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> live

may not understand what like how I live
and<00:03:37.950> how<00:03:38.879> my<00:03:39.060> family<00:03:39.569> works<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.980> guess<00:03:41.280> because

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and how my family works I guess because

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.009 
and how my family works I guess because
its<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.690> mix<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.319> different<00:03:43.440> cultures<00:03:44.000> eight

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
its a mix of different cultures eight

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.199 
its a mix of different cultures eight
feel<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.169> being<00:03:46.739> mixed<00:03:47.040> race<00:03:47.459> has<00:03:47.910> its

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
feel that being mixed race has its

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.449 
feel that being mixed race has its
benefit<00:03:48.690> well<00:03:48.870> yes<00:03:49.199> I<00:03:49.349> think<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.250> can

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
benefit well yes I think it's a it can

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.550 
benefit well yes I think it's a it can
make<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.790> more<00:03:51.090> open<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.780> other<00:03:51.930> cultures<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
make you more open to other cultures and

make you more open to other cultures and

this<00:04:57.480> can<00:04:57.720> be<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> quite<00:04:58.110> tough<00:04:58.290> one<00:04:58.530> because<00:04:58.710> it

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
this can be a quite tough one because it

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.450 
this can be a quite tough one because it
can<00:04:59.280> be<00:04:59.310> hard<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.610> feel<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.120> belong<00:05:00.420> to

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
can be hard to feel like you belong to

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.200 
can be hard to feel like you belong to
somewhere<00:05:02.960> basically<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.920> do<00:05:05.210> feel

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
somewhere basically because you do feel

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.520 
somewhere basically because you do feel
like<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.450> belong<00:05:06.660> in<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.840> little<00:05:07.050> bit<00:05:07.170> to<00:05:07.290> every

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
like you belong in a little bit to every

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.210 
like you belong in a little bit to every
culture<00:05:07.920> but<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.360> all<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:10.650> can't<00:05:10.860> relate

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
culture but all in all you can't relate

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.010 
culture but all in all you can't relate
completely<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:13.760> one<00:05:14.760> ethnicity<00:05:15.210> or<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.750> guess

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
completely to one ethnicity or I guess

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.050 
completely to one ethnicity or I guess
one<00:05:16.260> group<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.650> people<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.550> can<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.820> hard

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
one group of people and that can be hard

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.540 
one group of people and that can be hard
but<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.720> just<00:05:18.900> have<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.230> learn<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.680> accept<00:05:20.280> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
but you just have to learn to accept it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.930 
but you just have to learn to accept it
and<00:05:21.440> you<00:05:22.440> have<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.710> understand<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.280> the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
and you have to understand that the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.750 
and you have to understand that the
person<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.660> are<00:05:25.220> would<00:05:26.220> be<00:05:26.370> completely

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
person that you are would be completely

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.870 
person that you are would be completely
different<00:05:27.000> if<00:05:27.420> you<00:05:27.570> weren't<00:05:27.780> mixed<00:05:28.200> race<00:05:28.500> and
