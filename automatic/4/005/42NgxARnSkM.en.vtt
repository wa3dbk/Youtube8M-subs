00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
question is why was why was he being

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.200 
question is why was why was he being
pushed<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.869> hard<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.740> again<00:01:47.090> part<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pushed so hard and I think again part of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
pushed so hard and I think again part of
this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.720> they've<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.950> something

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this is they've got to have something

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
this is they've got to have something
that<00:01:50.759> people<00:01:50.909> will<00:01:51.149> buy<00:01:51.299> tickets<00:01:51.750> turfy<00:01:52.079> is

that people will buy tickets turfy is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.310 
that people will buy tickets turfy is
that<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> big<00:01:53.250> consideration<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
that it's a big consideration for this

he's a very very solid basketball player

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.080 
he's a very very solid basketball player
I'd<00:02:38.469> say<00:02:38.680> he's<00:02:38.889> a<00:02:38.919> borderline<00:02:39.459> starter<00:02:39.909> to<00:02:40.060> a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I'd say he's a borderline starter to a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.580 
I'd say he's a borderline starter to a
sure<00:02:40.299> fire<00:02:40.510> started<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.079> MB<00:02:41.349> he's<00:02:41.469> not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
sure fire started on the MB he's not

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.259

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
that regard he's a solid pick the 10th

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.159 
that regard he's a solid pick the 10th
pick<00:02:45.669> in<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.879> draft<00:02:45.909> and<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.569> obviously

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
pick in the draft and and obviously

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.379 
pick in the draft and and obviously
he'll<00:02:47.379> he'll<00:02:47.650> raise<00:02:48.189> some<00:02:48.430> eyebrows<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.969> stir

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389
