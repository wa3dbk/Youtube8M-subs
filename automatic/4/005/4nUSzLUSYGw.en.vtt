00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.520
 first thing that I encourage you to 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.049
 to do is to welcome to the garden 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.930
 all the little beasts that are 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.500
 actually the gardener's allies he 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.689
 air the ground 1 slip me the earth 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.330
 breaks down the humus into fertilizer and so 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.179
 will feed your soil and your plants 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.640
 do you know that bees drones 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.430
 are responsible for 80% of the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.410
 pollinating your tomatoes from you 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.240
 zucchini in the garden if these small 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.539
 beasts are not there you do not have any 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.780
 yield that a small number of species 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.809
 and crop pests and today 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.000
 there are many solutions 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 natural encourage is available 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.530
 in the gardening shelves 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.050
 they are the least harmful possible for 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.690
 useful insects and participates in 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.359
 the ecological balance tried to wear 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.120
 a new look at nature does 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.760
 trust the auxiliaries of the garden the 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.310
 ladybugs the tits full of others 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.090
 birds eat caterpillars 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.939
 aphids hedgehog flies devours 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.979
 snails ice cream if you 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.530
 landscaping and maintaining the garden 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.259
 spontaneously they will settle there 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.229
 and then we are a majority of 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.750
 amateur gardeners did that for the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.299
 pleasure to recharge your batteries 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.799
 relax and I think with all these 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.020
 little animals in your garden 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.350
 kids will love to discover your 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.140
 garden the simplest method for not 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 not exhaust your garden is the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.189
 crop rotation 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.159
 this technique several years old 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.479
 centuries is now resumed in 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.270
 reasoned agriculture 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.360
 everyone wants to cultivate his 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.960
 good natural tomatoes put a rank of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.530
 green beans 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.880
 the children ask for strawberries 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.149
 so do the crop rotation 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.490
 it is on the same ground to put 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.320
 plants with different needs you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.880
 must therefore know the great 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.980
 families of plants whose 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.170
 needs and predators are more or 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.480
 less similar I can already see who 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 think before we really need to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.000
 do that crop rotation is going to 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.680
 to prevent certain diseases and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.260
 the installation of pests on the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.810
 plants from the same family 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.790
 for example the tomato the potato 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.760
 and eggplant are from the same family 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.730
 and are therefore sensitive to one and the same 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 diseases like mildew 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.270
 this mushroom winter and settle 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.640
 in the residues of the plant that are 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.340
 stayed on the ground and spread again 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.920
 in the spring following the rotation of your 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.380
 cultures is the case will be so this 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.330
 propagation gear that can 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.900
 devastate a whole culture is very 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.660
 quickly even preferred the varieties 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.360
 of vegetables called rustica that resists well 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.180
 to diseases some families are 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.690
 known to be at risk like that of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.730
 cabbage ie turnips radishes 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.370
 the bean family the peas the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.220
 beans and the garlic family of 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.830
 leeks onions so every year 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.960
 I rotate my crops tomatoes 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.850
 salads green beans it's 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.680
 easy as pie 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.690
 it is enough to succeed to have a small 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.700
 little memory over three years or otherwise 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.420
 you noted in your garden notebook 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.880
 nothing serves to totally want 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.580
 eradicated pests and diseases in 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.350
 his garden the essential thing is that life 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.780
 of your plants is not put into 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.459
 danger by their attack so really 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.270
 focus on prevention 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.770
 a little reminder before prevention a 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.400
 plant whose growing conditions 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.430
 are well respected the floor the exhibition 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.220
 a little manure she will resist in 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.410
 general much better at diseases the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.650
 aphids attack weakened plants 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.900
 but also young tender stems 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.370
 that grows too quickly by a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.010
 exceed nitrogen inputs 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.110
 so especially respect the needs of 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.580
 your plants and promote all 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.110
 predators of aphids in your 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.820
 garden 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.160
 make your choice of plants in 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.660
 knowingly 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.489
 some insects are known to 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.500
 settle especially on 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.410
 some boards 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.650
 like the nightmare neither in charcoal the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.480
 cottoneasters the citrus shrubs then 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 do not hesitate to question 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.670
 professionals from whom you buy your 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.380
 plants in the fall protect from the cold 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.410
 your plantations with dead leaves 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.740
 and cover with manure or 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.520
 compost fattened for shrubs more 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.380
 fragile and unsustainable species 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.640
 swaddled them with a wintering veil 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.980
 more suitable than the covers 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.670
 laminated which cause them 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.430
 mold 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.350
 good it's cheaper even if you have 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.330
 nothing else breakthrough the material 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.700
 plasticized could let in the air 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.310
 for your even outside hotties 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.680
 treatment without forgetting to hide the pot 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.560
 because the roots gel very easily 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.750
 when they are not in the ground 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.810
 do not leave the remains of 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.880
 sick plants pick up leaves 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.790
 under the rose bushes under the fruit trees and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.750
 destroy them and then to avoid 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.090
 diseases 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.830
 watering is preferably done on 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.680
 morning and never on the leaves 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.360
 always at the foot of the plants 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.700
 I gave you some techniques for 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.669
 do prevention in your garden 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.390
 if you really have to treat opted for 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.610
 of the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.550
 natural products like porridge 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.460
 bordelaise who heals mildew and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.400
 many other diseases in the garden the 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.030
 black soap associate him with plants 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.840
 Aromatic garden is ideal for 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.880
 counter attack of aphids and koji 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.690
 attention scrupulously respect the 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.120
 dosage of the products you treat in the evening 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.180
 and you wait for our little ones 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.220
 companions of the gardener either left 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.900
 sleep that there are no more bees and 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.900
 for your hidden in the flowers 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.889
 Oh
