00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.750 
personal to you so like I have oily skin
so<00:02:48.860> I'm<00:02:48.920> going<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.070> talk<00:02:49.190> about<00:02:49.280> products<00:02:49.610> and

collection I really like some other
products<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.560> talked<00:03:57.830> about<00:03:57.860> them<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:58.610> some

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
products so I talked about them but some

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.920 
products so I talked about them but some
people<00:03:59.000> don't<00:03:59.150> talk<00:03:59.360> about<00:03:59.540> them<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.840> think

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
people don't talk about them and I think

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.449 
people don't talk about them and I think
that's<00:04:00.200> why<00:04:00.350> some<00:04:00.620> brands<00:04:00.980> don't<00:04:01.100> get<00:04:01.310> much

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
that's why some brands don't get much

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.460 
that's why some brands don't get much
recognition<00:04:01.880> because<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.780> big<00:04:02.989> lead<00:04:03.170> ship<00:04:03.200> is

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
recognition because the big lead ship is

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.080 
recognition because the big lead ship is
don't<00:04:03.650> talk<00:04:03.860> about<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:04.400> then<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.910> other

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
don't talk about it so then the other

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.550 
don't talk about it so then the other
