delay<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.230> spring<00:03:29.000> reverb<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.260> move

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
delay and I spring reverb you can move

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.530 
delay and I spring reverb you can move
this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.250> amp<00:03:32.430> position<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.390> move

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
this is the amp position so you can move

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.440 
this is the amp position so you can move
that<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:34.250> or<00:03:35.250> mix<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.580> oh<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:35.940> i've<00:03:36.210> got<00:03:36.360> an

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
that on or mix it oh really i've got an

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.830 
that on or mix it oh really i've got an
equaliser<00:03:37.010> coming<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.400> app<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
equaliser coming out the app so the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.650 
equaliser coming out the app so the
signal<00:03:40.200> comes<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.280> hits<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.790> these<00:03:42.420> two

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
signal comes in it hits the these two

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.430 
signal comes in it hits the these two
pedals<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:43.710> gets<00:03:44.610> fed<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
pedals and then gets fed to the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250 
pedals and then gets fed to the
simulator<00:03:46.440> damn<00:03:47.600> these<00:03:48.600> pedals<00:03:49.140> are

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
simulator damn these pedals are

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.720 
simulator damn these pedals are
simulated<00:03:49.710> too<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.220> then<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:51.360> equalizer<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
simulated too and then the equalizer and

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.280 
simulated too and then the equalizer and
this<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.030> app<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:55.290> set<00:03:55.710> up<00:03:57.290> it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
this is the app I have set up it's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.430 
this is the app I have set up it's
probably<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.710> bit<00:03:58.920> too<00:03:59.300> a<00:04:00.300> bit<00:04:00.510> creamy<00:04:00.990> sort<00:04:01.350> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
probably a bit too a bit creamy sort of

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.090 
probably a bit too a bit creamy sort of
sound<00:04:01.740> that's<00:04:02.010> how<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:03.710> good<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:05.070> know

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
sound that's how I like it good to know

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.340 
sound that's how I like it good to know
I<00:04:05.280> haven't<00:04:05.520> use<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.960> just<00:04:07.140> going<00:04:07.320> to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
I haven't use that it's just going to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.670 
I haven't use that it's just going to
feel<00:04:07.710> you<00:04:07.890> can't<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.430> haven't<00:04:08.910> worked<00:04:09.060> out<00:04:09.680> how

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
feel you can't I haven't worked out how

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.650 
feel you can't I haven't worked out how
to<00:04:10.740> put<00:04:11.190> any<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:12.210> your<00:04:12.420> own<00:04:12.540> VST<00:04:13.530> plugins<00:04:14.040> in

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
to put any of your own VST plugins in

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.360 
to put any of your own VST plugins in
it's<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:15.900> probably<00:04:16.380> tuning<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> bad

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
it's just probably tuning to the bad

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
it's just probably tuning to the bad
connection<00:04:17.720> that's<00:04:18.720> happening<00:04:19.080> now<00:04:20.390> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
connection that's happening now the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.940 
connection that's happening now the
other<00:04:21.480> thing<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.350> install<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.740> on

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
other thing is when you install it on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.860 
other thing is when you install it on
your<00:04:22.980> computer<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:25.710> puts<00:04:26.160> an<00:04:26.430> ilok<00:04:27.000> driver<00:04:27.450> on

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
your computer it puts an ilok driver on

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.950 
your computer it puts an ilok driver on
your<00:04:28.620> computer<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:33.180> don't<00:04:33.420> need<00:04:33.570> i<00:04:33.750> like

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
your computer and you don't need i like

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.070 
your computer and you don't need i like
to<00:04:34.140> run<00:04:34.290> this<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> year<00:04:35.570> but<00:04:36.570> some<00:04:36.810> people

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
to run this for a year but some people

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.600 
to run this for a year but some people
are<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.170> bit<00:04:37.260> sensitive<00:04:37.680> about<00:04:37.920> what<00:04:38.250> goes<00:04:38.430> on

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
are a bit sensitive about what goes on

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
are a bit sensitive about what goes on
the<00:04:38.730> computer<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.410> then<00:04:40.410> why<00:04:40.620> not<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.860> lot<00:04:41.070> want

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
the computer and then why not a lot want

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.870 
the computer and then why not a lot want
i<00:04:43.100> lock<00:04:44.210> drivers<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.480> probably<00:04:46.140> pretty<00:04:46.730> out<00:04:47.730> of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
i lock drivers is probably pretty out of

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.970 
i lock drivers is probably pretty out of
19<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.420> I<00:04:48.450> lot<00:04:48.750> but<00:04:49.050> some<00:04:49.650> people<00:04:49.950> just

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
19 but I lot but some people just

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.690 
19 but I lot but some people just
sensitive<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:50.970> something<00:04:52.490> other<00:04:53.490> than

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
sensitive to that something other than

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.940 
sensitive to that something other than
that<00:04:53.910> it's<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.390> seems<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.930> good<00:04:55.470> thing<00:04:55.800> to

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
that it's just seems a good thing to

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.630 
that it's just seems a good thing to
knock<00:04:56.100> right<00:04:56.280> easy<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.090> install<00:04:57.120> I've<00:04:58.080> got<00:04:58.640> the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
knock right easy to install I've got the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:08.320 
knock right easy to install I've got the
azo<00:05:02.030> two<00:05:04.729> drivers<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:06.150> deal<00:05:06.990> with<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.200> latency

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
azo two drivers to deal with the latency

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.980 
azo two drivers to deal with the latency
so<00:05:09.330> yeah<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:11.310> pretty<00:05:11.460> cool<00:05:11.820> i<00:05:12.120> reckon<00:05:12.720> i'm

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
so yeah it's pretty cool i reckon i'm

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.770 
so yeah it's pretty cool i reckon i'm
just<00:05:13.890> showing<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.490> end<00:05:14.640> you've<00:05:15.540> got

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
just showing the end you've got

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.080 
just showing the end you've got
different<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.260> types<00:05:16.669> very<00:05:17.669> different

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
different and types very different

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.070 
different and types very different
cabinet<00:05:18.450> types<00:05:18.720> different<00:05:18.930> microphone<00:05:19.620> types

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
cabinet types different microphone types

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.480 
cabinet types different microphone types
and<00:05:22.080> that's<00:05:22.260> about<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.530> i'll<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.979> very

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
and that's about it i'll just very

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:48.010 
and that's about it i'll just very
quickly<00:05:24.050> do<00:05:25.050> something<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.590> then<00:05:25.710> don't<00:05:26.130> be

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:06:01.060
