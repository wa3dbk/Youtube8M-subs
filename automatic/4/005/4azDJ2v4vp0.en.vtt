what we're gonna do is look at share

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.550 
what we're gonna do is look at share
pins<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.650> can<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.630> 3d<00:00:41.000> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.560> cool

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
pins so I can make a a 3d kind of cool

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.640 
pins so I can make a a 3d kind of cool
effect<00:00:44.360> because<00:00:45.360> I'll<00:00:45.780> show<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
shipping's
activate<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.830> what<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.610> we're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
activate so what I'm gonna do is we're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.110 
activate so what I'm gonna do is we're
going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.880> draw<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> crescent<00:00:54.780> shape<00:00:56.120> by

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
going to draw a crescent shape by

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.210 
going to draw a crescent shape by
drawing<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> circle<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.350> another<00:00:58.590> circle

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
drawing a circle and then another circle

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.360 
drawing a circle and then another circle
within<00:00:59.790> it<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:01.890> hope<00:01:02.160> we

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
within it and then I'm gonna hope we

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.600 
within it and then I'm gonna hope we
don't<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:05.329> stroke<00:01:06.329> we<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.810> done<00:01:06.990> oh

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
don't have the stroke we do need done oh

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170 
don't have the stroke we do need done oh
yeah<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.120> I<00:01:09.770> just<00:01:10.770> cut<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> there

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
yeah so I just cut that out of there

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.960 
yeah so I just cut that out of there
and<00:01:13.050> then<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.890> second<00:01:14.340> circle<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and then I use this second circle to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
and then I use this second circle to
select<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.630> delete<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.980> it<00:01:17.370> delete<00:01:17.760> sir

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
select and delete it so it delete sir

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.840 
select and delete it so it delete sir
what<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.800> what<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:19.890> overlaps<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> first

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what was what it overlaps of the first

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
what was what it overlaps of the first
circle<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.100> left

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
circle and so that's what we're left

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.760 
circle and so that's what we're left
with<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> frame<00:01:26.070> 15

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
with and then I'm gonna go to frame 15

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.270 
with and then I'm gonna go to frame 15
insert<00:01:28.770> keyframe<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:32.130> gonna

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
insert keyframe and then I'm gonna

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.360 
insert keyframe and then I'm gonna
delete<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:33.530> I'm<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:34.680> replace<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> with

and now we need to add the shape to him

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.520 
and now we need to add the shape to him
you<00:01:58.060> can't<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.569> by<00:01:58.749> right-clicking<00:01:59.259> you

this is what happens when you don't have
the<00:02:17.590> shear<00:02:18.099> pins<00:02:19.950> activated<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.810> go

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the shear pins activated and there we go

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600 
the shear pins activated and there we go
see<00:02:23.530> how<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.709> kind<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:25.049> overlaps<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.489> know

little more 3d and just more
professional<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.349> let's<00:02:38.349> do<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:40.299> add<00:02:40.420> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
professional so let's do this to add a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.460 
professional so let's do this to add a
shape<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.040> go<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.730> first<00:02:43.120> keyframe

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
shape and you can go to first keyframe

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.400 
shape and you can go to first keyframe
go<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:45.129> believe<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.519> modify<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:47.290> of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
go to I believe it's modify it's one of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.190 
go to I believe it's modify it's one of
these<00:02:47.530> yep<00:02:47.950> shape<00:02:48.310> add<00:02:49.239> shape<00:02:49.629> in<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
these yep shape add shape in but I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
these yep shape add shape in but I
usually<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.799> press<00:02:51.099> control<00:02:51.609> shift<00:02:51.640> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
usually just press control shift and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.680 
usually just press control shift and
edge<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.750> hockey<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.829> select<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
edge it's the hockey so select that and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.330 
edge it's the hockey so select that and
now<00:02:55.750> you'll<00:02:56.109> see<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:58.260> small<00:02:59.260> red<00:02:59.470> orb<00:02:59.859> has

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
now you'll see that a small red orb has

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.160 
now you'll see that a small red orb has
appeared<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> middle<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:01.900> drag

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
appeared in the middle and you can drag

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.740 
appeared in the middle and you can drag
this<00:03:02.349> around<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.889> put<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.220> wherever<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.519> want

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
this around and put it wherever you want

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.390 
this around and put it wherever you want
obviously<00:03:04.750> meant<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.109> snap<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.920> you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
obviously meant to snap it on to you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.330 
obviously meant to snap it on to you
simp<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.630> artwork<00:03:08.049> somewhere<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:12.130> this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
simp the artwork somewhere but in this

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.379 
simp the artwork somewhere but in this
example<00:03:12.700> I'm<00:03:12.819> gonna<00:03:12.940> put<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.209> at<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.359> top

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
example I'm gonna put it at the top

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.180 
example I'm gonna put it at the top
which<00:03:14.049> means<00:03:14.639> if<00:03:15.639> I<00:03:15.819> go<00:03:15.970> over<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.510> frame<00:03:16.780> 15

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
which means if I go over to frame 15

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.140 
which means if I go over to frame 15
there's<00:03:18.190> also<00:03:18.340> an<00:03:18.669> area<00:03:18.819> which<00:03:19.030> are

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
there's also an area which are

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.259 
there's also an area which are
composition<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.349> if<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.680> place<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.269> down

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
composition and if I place this down

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.360 
composition and if I place this down
yeah<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:22.870> keep<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.260> middle<00:03:23.560> what<00:03:24.160> this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
yeah for keep it in the middle what this

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.420 
yeah for keep it in the middle what this
means<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:24.849> at<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.930> point<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.650> air<00:03:26.919> point<00:03:27.220> on

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
means is at this point this air point on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.940 
means is at this point this air point on
frame<00:03:27.760> 1<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.599> going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.989> travel<00:03:29.230> along<00:03:29.470> here

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
frame 1 is going to travel along here

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.240 
frame 1 is going to travel along here
and<00:03:30.160> finish<00:03:30.790> up<00:03:31.000> down<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.919> if<00:03:33.010> we<00:03:33.069> watch

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and finish up down here so if we watch

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.520 
and finish up down here so if we watch
that<00:03:33.489> see

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
that see

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.290 
that see
yeah<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.220> did<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.550> it's<00:03:36.790> kind<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.060> hard<00:03:37.120> to

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
yeah it did that it's kind of hard to

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.700 
yeah it did that it's kind of hard to
see<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.830> what<00:03:38.920> we<00:03:39.040> need<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.220> do<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.550> add<00:03:39.730> another

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
see so what we need to do is add another

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.830 
see so what we need to do is add another
on<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.920> bottom<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.760> remember<00:03:43.210> that's<00:03:43.330> control

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
on the bottom so remember that's control

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.130 
on the bottom so remember that's control
shift<00:03:44.560> or<00:03:44.860> H<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:46.270> we're<00:03:46.600> going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.750> drag<00:03:46.960> this

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
shift or H and we're going to drag this

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.050 
shift or H and we're going to drag this
down<00:03:47.200> here<00:03:49.230> okay<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:51.220> we<00:03:51.370> go<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.490> 15<00:03:51.730> it

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
down here okay and if we go to 15 it

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.940 
down here okay and if we go to 15 it
should<00:03:52.180> already<00:03:52.330> be<00:03:52.480> added<00:03:52.840> here<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.710> drag

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
should already be added here so drag

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.860 
should already be added here so drag
this<00:03:54.100> down<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.580> bottom<00:03:54.970> air<00:03:55.300> needs<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.690> go

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
this down to the bottom air needs to go

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.100 
this down to the bottom air needs to go
to<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:55.990> top<00:03:56.230> remember<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:56.920> now<00:03:57.910> if<00:03:58.240> we<00:03:58.330> test

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
to the top remember and now if we test

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.690 
to the top remember and now if we test
it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.120 

see<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.569> see<00:04:02.930> how<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.110> looks<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:03.410> much<00:04:03.470> more

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
see that see how it looks so much more

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.870 
see that see how it looks so much more
3d<00:04:05.590> instead<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:06.830> all<00:04:06.950> overlapping<00:04:07.640> and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
3d instead of it all overlapping and

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.330 
3d instead of it all overlapping and
screwing<00:04:08.240> up<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:11.540> how<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.810> make<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.350> cool

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
screwing up that's how you make a cool

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.509 
screwing up that's how you make a cool
kind<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.760> 3d<00:04:14.209> effect<00:04:14.540> using<00:04:14.959> champions<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
kind of 3d effect using champions you

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.550 
kind of 3d effect using champions you
can<00:04:16.760> add<00:04:16.940> up<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:18.459> 26<00:04:19.459> different<00:04:20.019> share<00:04:21.019> pins<00:04:21.290> I

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
can add up to 26 different share pins I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
can add up to 26 different share pins I
think<00:04:22.270> around<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.660> if<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.870> really<00:04:24.020> want<00:04:24.320> to

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
think around so if you really want to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.500 
think around so if you really want to
customize<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.900> do<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:29.360> I

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
customize it you know and do that but I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.330 
customize it you know and do that but I
