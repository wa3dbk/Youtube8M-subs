00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.500
 you how? 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.800
 you when? 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.900
 you where? 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.120
 never a why ... 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.640
 you get undressed.. 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400
 the light 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 turn on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.840
 ... on me 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 radiant in the dark you trembled .. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 honest makeup is easier ... 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.800
 ... with you I had to be, maybe feeling alien ... insensitive 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 see with my myopia, discuss unlikely choices ... 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 if they are what I am ... I chose to stay by your side 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.460
 suffering from my mistakes ... I chose to change again ... 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 No ... my love doesn't end here ... it doesn't end 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 no ... my love doesn't end here ... it doesn't end 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 left the bed on top ... the photos a dead body ... not just me 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.400
 It is a revolution that makes my life unstable ... 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 I cling to a memory ... light a living flame 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.900
 offering without daring scornfully your warm embrace ... 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.100
 No ... my love doesn't end here ... it doesn't end 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 no ... my love doesn't end here ... it doesn't end 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 tu..uh ... uh ... how? 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.000
 tu..uh ... uh ... where? 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400
 You ... huh ... uh ... when? 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 radiant in the dark you trembled .. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 staying alone is easier ...
