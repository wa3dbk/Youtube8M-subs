00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
insides of that so that it's more of a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
insides of that so that it's more of a
transition<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> colors<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.329> just

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
little bit so I went a little bit by a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.000 
little bit so I went a little bit by a
little<00:03:59.989> bit<00:04:00.140> just<00:04:00.380> getting<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.799> where<00:04:00.980> I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
little bit just getting it where I

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.400 
little bit just getting it where I
wanted<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.459> be<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.850> then<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.090> fill<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:03.049> all

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
the inside so I kind of line it with a

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.650 
the inside so I kind of line it with a
lip<00:04:05.780> tar<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.140> not<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.320> liner<00:04:07.030> then<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.060> thought<00:04:08.390> I

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660
