00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.359
 ds for android 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 reader 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
 to use 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 but it has the paid version but it's worth a lot 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 feather 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
 half bugged does not work right somebody 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.989

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.680
 It's free but it's all excited here. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 demo version as I said that the paid version 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.430
 but it works perfectly the game does not 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.909
 lock and wheel the game lisinho leaves opened 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.570
 Super Mario Bros 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.259
 No one is there, so it's working. 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 right the commands watch the party running 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.549
 So that's where the game is running, right? 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.430
 so the audio lock is working 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.450
 perfectly running a rate of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 frames per second very interesting 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.640
