can really as they cut them or damage
them<00:02:19.100> other<00:02:19.580> Watts<00:02:19.790> themselves<00:02:20.540> are<00:02:20.690> other

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
them other Watts themselves are other

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.160 
them other Watts themselves are other
rods<00:02:21.140> because<00:02:22.040> they're<00:02:22.220> man-made<00:02:23.739> material

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
rods because they're man-made material

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.150 
rods because they're man-made material
yeah<00:02:27.170> they're<00:02:27.350> brittle<00:02:27.680> if<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.860> threw<00:02:28.040> them

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
yeah they're brittle if you threw them

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.590 
yeah they're brittle if you threw them
on<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.280> floor<00:02:28.370> they're<00:02:28.670> probably<00:02:28.850> snap<00:02:29.239> but

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
on the floor they're probably snap but

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.770 
on the floor they're probably snap but
in<00:02:29.780> terms<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.489> hardness<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:33.019> very<00:02:33.200> very<00:02:33.470> hard

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
in terms of hardness and very very hard

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.100 
in terms of hardness and very very hard
so<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.470> done<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.840> tell

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
so that's one done and you can just tell

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.930 
so that's one done and you can just tell
you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.800> see<00:02:40.010> already<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:41.360> almost<00:02:41.769> well<00:02:42.940> as

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
you can see already it's almost well as

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.690 
you can see already it's almost well as
wiring<00:02:44.209> can<00:02:44.480> be<00:02:44.660> already<00:02:45.470> now<00:02:46.040> what<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.220> do<00:02:46.370> here

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
wiring can be already now what I do here

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.479 
wiring can be already now what I do here
so<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.720> give<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.230> good<00:02:48.620> rinse<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> leave

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
so just give it a good rinse and leave

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.060 
so just give it a good rinse and leave
it<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.730> talented<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.440> next<00:02:54.680> one<00:02:54.860> I

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
it on a talented and the next one I

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.390 
it on a talented and the next one I
don't<00:02:55.310> apply<00:02:55.670> any<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> paste<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> rinse

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
don't apply any of the paste but I rinse

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.319 
don't apply any of the paste but I rinse
it<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> then<00:03:03.250> scrub<00:03:04.250> away<00:03:04.489> with<00:03:04.790> some<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
it and then scrub away with some of the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.600 
it and then scrub away with some of the
pace<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.989> was<00:03:06.079> already<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.340> cloth

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
pace that was already on that the cloth

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:23.900 
pace that was already on that the cloth
from<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.630> other<00:03:08.780> one

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.100 

before<00:03:24.910> anybody<00:03:25.060> says<00:03:25.390> how<00:03:25.600> you've<00:03:25.810> left<00:03:25.960> the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
before anybody says how you've left the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.750 
before anybody says how you've left the
tap<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.500> you've<00:03:26.680> left<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.950> tap<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.280> why<00:03:27.490> waste

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
tap on you've left the tap on why waste

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.700 
tap on you've left the tap on why waste
all<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.210> water<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.810> hope<00:03:29.290> people<00:03:29.470> realize

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
all that water I hope people realize

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.560 
all that water I hope people realize
that<00:03:29.920> when<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.340> go<00:03:30.460> for<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.670> pee<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.390> flush

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
that when you go for a pee and you flush

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.630 
that when you go for a pee and you flush
that<00:03:31.750> water<00:03:32.320> down<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.920> gets<00:03:33.040> recycled<00:03:33.190> back

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that water down it gets recycled back

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.460 
that water down it gets recycled back
into<00:03:33.670> drinking<00:03:34.210> water<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.110> water<00:03:35.260> that's

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
into drinking water and the water that's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.530 
into drinking water and the water that's
going<00:03:35.560> into<00:03:35.830> this<00:03:36.010> tap<00:03:36.280> now<00:03:36.490> will<00:03:37.420> get

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
going into this tap now will get

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.740 
going into this tap now will get
recycled<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.410> put<00:03:38.860> back<00:03:39.010> into<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.310> tap<00:03:39.750> but

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
recycled and put back into the tap but

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.560 
recycled and put back into the tap but
maybe<00:03:40.930> some<00:03:41.470> people<00:03:41.620> don't<00:03:41.950> realize<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.280> but

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
maybe some people don't realize that but

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.300 
maybe some people don't realize that but
because<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.870> didn't<00:03:44.200> happen<00:03:44.260> well<00:03:45.190> there

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
because if that didn't happen well there

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.000 
because if that didn't happen well there
be<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> shortage<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.910> water<00:03:46.150> within<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.800> few<00:03:47.800> days

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
be a shortage of water within a few days

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.240 
be a shortage of water within a few days
our<00:03:48.310> economic<00:03:48.730> worldwide<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:49.480> here<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:49.930> go<00:03:50.250> so

our economic worldwide but here we go so

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.520 
our economic worldwide but here we go so
that's<00:03:51.400> nice<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.910> clean<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.780> plus<00:03:53.290> it's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
that's nice and clean and plus it's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that's nice and clean and plus it's
easier<00:03:53.860> for<00:03:53.890> me<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.070> just<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.400> this

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
easier for me to just do this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.090 
easier for me to just do this

turn<00:03:58.030> them<00:03:58.210> they're<00:03:58.390> tapped<00:03:59.050> off<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.410> on<00:04:00.240> so

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
turn them they're tapped off and on so

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.040 
turn them they're tapped off and on so
that's<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.570> one<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.490> do<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:04.050> I'll

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
that's that one and all you do is I'll

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.950 
that's that one and all you do is I'll
turn<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.290> tap<00:04:05.470> off<00:04:05.590> now<00:04:05.800> all<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.460> do<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.960> rinse

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
turn the tap off now all you do is rinse

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.150 
turn the tap off now all you do is rinse

and repeat no pun intended for for all
of<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.400> rods<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:13.450> do<00:04:13.960> this<00:04:14.140> with<00:04:14.380> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
of the rods you can do this with the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.699 
of the rods you can do this with the
brown<00:04:16.709> medium<00:04:17.709> grit<00:04:18.070> rods<00:04:18.280> absolutely<00:04:19.090> fine

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
brown medium grit rods absolutely fine

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.950 
brown medium grit rods absolutely fine
they<00:04:20.709> are<00:04:20.860> more<00:04:21.489> difficult<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:22.300> get<00:04:22.630> clean

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
they are more difficult to get clean

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.920 
they are more difficult to get clean
that<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.710> don't<00:04:24.460> know<00:04:24.520> what<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.660> must<00:04:25.810> be

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that I don't know what it must be

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.900 
that I don't know what it must be
because<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.350> grit<00:04:26.590> because<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:27.550> hard<00:04:27.760> a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
because of the grit because it's hard a

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.890 
because of the grit because it's hard a
grit<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.450> a<00:04:28.660> way<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:29.820> this<00:04:30.820> steel<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.150> harder<00:04:31.870> to

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
grit in a way so this steel is harder to

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.190 
grit in a way so this steel is harder to
remove<00:04:32.350> than<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.460> knees<00:04:33.670> but<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:34.990> can<00:04:35.140> see

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
remove than the knees but as you can see

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.040 
remove than the knees but as you can see
hopefully<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.160> camera<00:04:36.310> focus<00:04:36.760> there<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.900> can

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
hopefully the camera focus there you can

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.790 
hopefully the camera focus there you can
see<00:04:38.260> look<00:04:39.040> at<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:40.140> steel<00:04:41.140> that's<00:04:41.320> loaded<00:04:41.710> on

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
see look at the steel that's loaded on

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.760 
see look at the steel that's loaded on
the<00:04:41.890> rod<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.360> compare<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.930> with<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.140> one

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
the rod and you compare it with the one

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.860 
the rod and you compare it with the one
I've<00:04:44.920> just<00:04:45.070> washed<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.700> hope<00:04:46.390> that's<00:04:46.600> visible

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
I've just washed I hope that's visible

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.140 
I've just washed I hope that's visible
for<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.640> it's<00:04:51.760> kind<00:04:51.970> of<00:04:52.000> like

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
for you and so it's kind of like

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.790 
for you and so it's kind of like
brushing<00:04:52.360> your<00:04:52.540> teeth<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:53.080> brushing<00:04:53.710> your

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
brushing your teeth but brushing your

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.260 
brushing your teeth but brushing your
rods<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:56.220> that's<00:04:57.220> what<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.430> do<00:04:57.580> frequency

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
rods and that's what you do frequency

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.070 
rods and that's what you do frequency
this<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:59.250> I'd<00:05:00.250> get<00:05:00.550> them<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:01.150> about<00:05:01.330> this<00:05:01.540> it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
this I I'd get them to about this it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.740 
this I I'd get them to about this it
really<00:05:02.200> depends<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.100> mean<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:04.300> more<00:05:04.480> steel

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
really depends I mean the more steel

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.360 
really depends I mean the more steel
you've<00:05:04.990> got<00:05:05.140> loaded<00:05:05.350> on<00:05:05.530> these<00:05:05.680> rods<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.250> less

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
you've got loaded on these rods the less

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.860 
you've got loaded on these rods the less
efficient<00:05:06.850> they're<00:05:06.940> gonna<00:05:07.060> be<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.720> more

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
efficient they're gonna be and the more

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.650 
efficient they're gonna be and the more
strokes<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.470> potentially<00:05:09.070> might<00:05:09.250> need<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.880> to

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
strokes you potentially might need to to

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.890 
strokes you potentially might need to to
use<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:11.110> your<00:05:11.200> knives<00:05:11.440> but<00:05:13.440> I'd<00:05:14.440> do<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:15.570> once<00:05:16.570> a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
use on your knives but I'd do it once a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.800 
use on your knives but I'd do it once a
month<00:05:17.250> maybe<00:05:18.250> depends<00:05:19.150> how<00:05:19.330> many<00:05:19.540> times

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
month maybe depends how many times

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.780 
month maybe depends how many times
sharpen<00:05:20.260> your<00:05:20.320> knife<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:20.770> think<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.430> could<00:05:21.610> go

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
sharpen your knife I think you could go

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.850 
sharpen your knife I think you could go
a<00:05:22.060> month<00:05:22.450> or<00:05:22.630> two<00:05:22.810> without<00:05:23.110> doing<00:05:23.710> this

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
a month or two without doing this

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.760 
a month or two without doing this
procedure<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:26.530> move<00:05:26.830> over<00:05:27.070> here

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
procedure but I just move over here

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.249 
procedure but I just move over here
and<00:05:27.889> just<00:05:28.069> put<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.400> rods<00:05:29.060> on<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.240> towel<00:05:29.569> leave

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
and just put the rods on a towel leave

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.400 
and just put the rods on a towel leave
them<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.530> dry<00:05:30.650> for<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.039> couple<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.310> hours<00:05:31.460> and

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
them to dry for a couple of hours and

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.089 
them to dry for a couple of hours and
then<00:05:33.410> use<00:05:33.740> them<00:05:33.979> don't<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.690> wouldn't<00:05:35.690> suggest

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
then use them don't I wouldn't suggest

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.460 
then use them don't I wouldn't suggest
drying<00:05:37.099> them<00:05:37.400> immediately<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.539> then<00:05:39.050> using

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
drying them immediately and then using

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.770 
drying them immediately and then using
them<00:05:39.590> within<00:05:39.740> an<00:05:39.949> hour<00:05:40.099> or<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.490> think<00:05:40.909> that

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
them within an hour or so I think that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.960 
them within an hour or so I think that
that<00:05:42.080> might<00:05:42.409> cause<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:42.860> some<00:05:42.889> problems<00:05:43.039> but

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
that might cause you some problems but

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.270 
that might cause you some problems but
anyway<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.360> thought<00:05:44.539> you'd<00:05:44.840> then<00:05:45.440> this<00:05:46.039> video

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
anyway I thought you'd then this video

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.240 
anyway I thought you'd then this video
be<00:05:46.430> quite<00:05:46.669> useful<00:05:46.849> on<00:05:47.240> how<00:05:47.509> to<00:05:48.190> clean<00:05:49.190> your

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
be quite useful on how to clean your

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.159 
be quite useful on how to clean your
rods<00:05:49.520> efficiently<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:51.879> there<00:05:52.879> you<00:05:53.030> go<00:05:53.169> anyway

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
rods efficiently and there you go anyway

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.020 
rods efficiently and there you go anyway
