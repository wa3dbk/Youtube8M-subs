00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
settings so you can have auto 4 100

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
settings so you can have auto 4 100
children<00:02:14.220> 100<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.940> obviously<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
children 100 so obviously don't go to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.870 
children 100 so obviously don't go to
the<00:02:15.660> high<00:02:15.810> sends<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.530> again<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.700> coming

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the high sends but again is it coming

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
the high sends but again is it coming
with<00:02:18.060> enough<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:18.990> gonna<00:02:19.170> have

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
with enough on so it's not gonna have

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.380 
with enough on so it's not gonna have
the<00:02:19.350> highest<00:02:19.530> settings<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.580> last

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the highest settings out there and last

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.430 
the highest settings out there and last
but<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.600> least<00:02:21.660> he<00:02:22.020> can<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> different

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440

which<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.750> think's<00:02:30.990> nice<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.460> if<00:02:32.580> we<00:02:32.640> switch<00:02:32.910> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
which I think's nice so if we switch to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.150 
which I think's nice so if we switch to
the<00:02:33.210> camera<00:02:34.140> office<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.070> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
believe that's it and if I was storage

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.570 
believe that's it and if I was storage
card<00:03:13.230> yeah<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> storage

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
card yeah you can if you have a storage

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.190 
card yeah you can if you have a storage
card<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.940> there<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.690> obviously<00:03:15.750> record

to<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> storage<00:03:16.620> card<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.520> got<00:03:17.700> eight

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
to the storage card it's got eight

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.490 
to the storage card it's got eight
gigabytes<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.330> memory<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.080> it's<00:03:19.230> got<00:03:19.350> plenty

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
gigabytes of memory so it's got plenty

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.590 
gigabytes of memory so it's got plenty
tough<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.070> starting<00:03:20.400> off<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.420> what
