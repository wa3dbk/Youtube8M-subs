one<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.549> a<00:00:08.760> google<00:00:08.940> mounting<00:00:09.540> hole<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> I'm

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
one is a google mounting hole and I'm

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.370 
one is a google mounting hole and I'm
part<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> ranch

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.220 

this<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.430> frame<00:00:31.670> for<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.970> res<00:00:32.230> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
this is the the frame for the res so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.410 
this is the the frame for the res so
basically<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.250> resident<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:34.640> saw<00:00:34.850> sits

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
basically the resident you saw sits

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.410 
basically the resident you saw sits
behind<00:00:35.600> here<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.320> can<00:00:36.410> see<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.710> two

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
behind here and you can see the two

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.960 
behind here and you can see the two
coolants<00:00:38.420> coming<00:00:38.690> down<00:00:39.460> be<00:00:40.460> getting<00:00:40.700> sucked

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
coolants coming down be getting sucked

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.510 
coolants coming down be getting sucked
out<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:42.680> think<00:00:42.920> one<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.190> my<00:00:43.309> subscribers

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
out so I think one of my subscribers

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.130 
out so I think one of my subscribers
asked<00:00:44.420> why<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.300> placement<00:00:47.930> for<00:00:48.080> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
asked why the to the placement for the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.579 
asked why the to the placement for the
the<00:00:48.739> holes<00:00:48.980> were<00:00:49.820> around<00:00:50.540> here<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.019> not<00:00:51.260> down

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
the holes were around here and not down

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.560 
the holes were around here and not down
here<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:52.460> because<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.879> client<00:00:53.239> wanted<00:00:53.449> to

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
here it's because the client wanted to

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.390 
here it's because the client wanted to
see<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.019> water<00:00:54.199> going<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:54.920> out<00:00:54.980> even

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
see the water going in and out even

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.299 
see the water going in and out even
though<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:56.420> wasting<00:00:56.870> volume<00:00:57.230> either<00:00:57.890> side

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
though you're wasting volume either side

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.670 
though you're wasting volume either side
so<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.910> mean<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.930> volume<00:01:00.260> doesn't<00:01:00.559> really

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
so I mean the volume doesn't really

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.619 
so I mean the volume doesn't really
matter<00:01:00.860> because<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:01.400> thing<00:01:01.640> holds<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.449> much

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
matter because this thing holds so much

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.289 
matter because this thing holds so much
water<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:04.100> then<00:01:04.430> we've<00:01:04.790> just<00:01:05.000> got<00:01:05.150> the

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
water and then we've just got the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.539 
water and then we've just got the
mounting<00:01:05.900> holes<00:01:06.140> six<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.710> them<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.190> just

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
mounting holes six of them and this just

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.609 
mounting holes six of them and this just
sits<00:01:07.760> in<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> front<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.299> case<00:01:08.510> yeah<00:01:09.320> this

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
sits in the front of the case yeah this

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.130 
sits in the front of the case yeah this
doesn't<00:01:09.830> mean<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.159> best<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.520> injuries<00:01:11.140> it's

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
doesn't mean the best of injuries it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.070 
doesn't mean the best of injuries it's
really<00:01:12.290> hard<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.650> do<00:01:13.330> things<00:01:14.330> with<00:01:14.479> one<00:01:14.810> hand

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
really hard to do things with one hand

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.500 
really hard to do things with one hand
and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.460

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
he's one of the cuts I've done for a

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.179 
he's one of the cuts I've done for a
client<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.659> mine<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.950> got<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.189> EVGA<00:01:37.430> ati

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
client of mine just got the EVGA ati

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.819 
client of mine just got the EVGA ati
Intel<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.579> he<00:01:41.299> decided<00:01:41.720> put<00:01:41.899> my<00:01:42.049> logo<00:01:42.649> on

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
Intel and he decided put my logo on

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.240 
Intel and he decided put my logo on
there<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.159> well<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:44.060> since<00:01:44.299> there's<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
there as well and this since there's a

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.639 
there as well and this since there's a
side<00:01:46.250> window<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.630> that's<00:01:47.930> obviously<00:01:48.079> going<00:01:48.350> on

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
side window so that's obviously going on

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.880 
side window so that's obviously going on
the<00:01:48.710> side<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.159> case<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.679> with<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.710> bit<00:01:51.830> of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
the side of this case and with a bit of

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.490 
the side of this case and with a bit of
back<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.549> look<00:01:52.789> quite<00:01:53.000> good<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:54.380> these

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
back like that look quite good so these

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.010 
back like that look quite good so these
are<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.710> two<00:01:55.130> producers<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.509> basically<00:01:56.929> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
are the two producers so basically the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.660 
are the two producers so basically the
same<00:01:57.170> thing<00:01:57.229> as<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> x-series<00:01:57.890> water<00:01:58.310> goes<00:01:58.490> in

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
same thing as the x-series water goes in

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.840 
same thing as the x-series water goes in
