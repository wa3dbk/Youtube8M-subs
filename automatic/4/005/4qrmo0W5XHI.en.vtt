00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.660
 yes 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.680
 and now all my name is gamer fox and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.310
 this is the fourth episode of my guide 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.410
 halo weapons 4 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.680
 this time we will cover the mental reflector 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.720
 a new gel weapon or this rifle arrived 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.020
 to replace the plasma rifle that 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.620
 had been present in all the turns 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.620
 until now 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.240
 at stake the damage is medium you will not need 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 at least 13 bullets to kill u 11 a 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.070
 the head although in spite of it the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.130
 range of the weapon is short like the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 penetration that this has 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.900
 as we see even though the damage of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.730
 storm rifle is the highest among 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.370
 all the main assault rifles 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.100
 that is to say of the suppressor and the rifle of 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.620
 human jump this rifle is very poor in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 long distance combat 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.950
 could be affected in medium combats 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.800
 distance if you do not have a large 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.930
 accuracy in your shots 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.520
 the rate of fire that the reflector 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.500
 mint has also is quite high with 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.960
 415 bullets per minute so the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.300
 speed of the storm rifle is very 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.760
 acceptable 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.610
 on the other hand the rich in the weapon is 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
 maybe when you use it, do not notice 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.050
 that the weapon moves too much but in 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.210
 the time to shoot large bursts 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.380
 you will realize that the rich man and the weapon 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 It will affect you a lot in fighting this makes 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.370
 that this weapon is better in battles 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.500
 close with the great cadence of fire 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.530
 will give you more tolerant performance 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.660
 but the rich will make the pressure very 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 low for it a tip that I can 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.170
 give them is that you shoot by means of 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.970
 bursts to get more 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 precision 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.950
 The capacity of the charger is simply 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.080
 incredible although it is difficult to calculate 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.060
 since the chargers are based on 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.550
 of plasma battery units 100 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.990
 to be exact although if we have 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
 stop the ammunition that the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.040
 reflector mind has we will reach 150 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.600
 bullets a maximum of 200 bullets and if 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 We count as mission as package 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.690
 tactical we will have 150 units of 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.180
 batteries what would count with 300 bullets 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.370
 Seeing this monstrous amount of bullets 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.830
 that the reflector mind has many 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.750
 they will think that it is the best choice but 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.400
 they are wrong since when firing 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.250
 certain amount of bullets incessantly 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.680
 will cause the rifle to heat up and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.380
 We'll have to wait for it to cool down and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.180
 this duration is 2.90 seconds what 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.820
 enough for an enemy that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 completely annihilate our 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.200
 equipment with the storm rifle should 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.270
 be oriented to an aggressive use with a 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.290
 mixture of speed resistance and 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.239
 short-range offensive capability 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.069
 the main problem of the reflector 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.469
 mind is that it does not serve absolutely 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.810
 nothing in long distance combats 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.989
 for that reason we will have as a secondary weapon 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.730
 the magna we have chosen the magnum for its 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.189
 great power at great distances 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.780
 besides that the storm rifle will be 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.760
 instead of being useful in combat it is in the long run 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.220
 and up to half distance as we saw 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.620
 previously so the mag will serve us 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.970
 to reinforce those weaknesses that 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.970
 has the mental reflector 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.209
 the best option we have in combat 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.760
 is to stun and make the enemy fall 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.470
 in our trap so they know who 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.570
 is the one who commands in the field 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.240
 for this we will use the ability to 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.590
 hologram with it the enemies will create 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.350
 our lies and we can 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.810
 surprise them and annihilate them quickly 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.790
 to support our deceptions to the enemy 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.100
 and fall in surprise before them we must 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.430
 be quick for this we will use 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.280
 mobility by mobility as a package 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.600
 tactical this to be able to face without 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.560
 limit some 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.840
 finally but not least 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.570
 important we will use ammunition as 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.700
 our support improvement many people opt 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.010
 by choosing dexterity thinking that the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.140
 Cooling time will be less but 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.940
 that is totally wrong for that 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.880
 we will have to choose ammunition for now 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.040
 have 150 units of batteries 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.040
 which would have a total of 300 bullets 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.360
 in conclusion the storm rifle is 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.060
 pretty fast and very powerful in 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.940
 close combats but it's pretty weak 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.280
 in long distance fighting which you 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.100
 will affect enough if an enemy is 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.990
 shooting from the other side of the map another 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.270
 disadvantage that should be highlighted is the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.000
 Rapid overheating of the reflector 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.190
 mental that will cause you many 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.410
 problems if you are in a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.870
 risk situation 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.120
 still the storm rifle is perfect in 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.190
 short distance fighting and the great 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.710
 fire cadence that holds stands out 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.710
 over the other assault rifles and with 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.920
 this great equipment that we have 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.870
 we will bring out the best of the mental reflector 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.500
 your goal with the storm rifle is very 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.289
 clear annihilate the all and any 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.180
 that stands in your way 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.460
 feel the thunder of the storm 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.139
 thanks for watching the video here are others 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.940
 three videos that you can see if it is 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.530
 who want to like the page of 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.180
 facebook that is in the description and 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.990
 accompany next Friday where 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.880
 we'll review the covenant carbine up 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.880
 then luck to all 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.230
