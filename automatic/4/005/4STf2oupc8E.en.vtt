be to pull this straight up and now it
should<00:02:12.730> be<00:02:12.880> ready<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:15.160> assemble<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.010> can

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
should be ready this assemble if you can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.870 
should be ready this assemble if you can
there's<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.290> glue<00:02:20.770> inside<00:02:21.250> here<00:02:21.459> holding

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
there's just glue inside here holding

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.490 
there's just glue inside here holding
these<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> can<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.930> crack<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
these in if you can just crack it a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.020 
these in if you can just crack it a
little<00:02:23.680> bit<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:25.150> should<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.540> able<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:27.030> pop

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
little bit it should be able to pop

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.390 
little bit it should be able to pop
right<00:02:28.240> out

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
right out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.680 
right out
and<00:02:30.400> then<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.850> piece<00:02:31.120> will<00:02:31.330> slide<00:02:31.660> right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
and then this piece will slide right

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.740 
and then this piece will slide right
through<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.440> gotta<00:02:32.590> slide<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.950> through<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
through you gotta slide it through the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
through you gotta slide it through the
the<00:02:34.750> interior<00:02:35.260> side<00:02:35.500> otherwise<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.100> won't<00:02:36.280> fit

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
the interior side otherwise it won't fit

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.180 
the interior side otherwise it won't fit
and<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.450> will<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.959> step<00:02:38.260> two<00:02:40.680> okay<00:02:41.680> step

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
and that will be step two okay step

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.550 
and that will be step two okay step
three<00:02:42.520> will<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.150> put<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.989> new<00:02:44.200> chord

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
three will be to put in the new chord

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.940 
three will be to put in the new chord
for<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.890> cymbal<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.140> wanna<00:02:47.290> flip<00:02:47.770> it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
for the cymbal so you just wanna flip it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.199 
for the cymbal so you just wanna flip it
back<00:02:48.130> over<00:02:50.580> you're<00:02:51.580> gonna<00:02:51.700> run<00:02:51.970> this

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
back over you're gonna run this

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.300 
back over you're gonna run this
connection<00:02:52.900> side<00:02:53.170> with<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> white

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
connection side with the white

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:06.030 
connection side with the white
connection<00:02:54.820> side<00:02:55.739> right<00:02:56.739> through<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.680> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
connection side right through it's a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.820 
connection side right through it's a
little<00:03:06.519> tricky<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.750> work<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.380> out<00:03:08.470> with<00:03:08.650> your

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
little tricky just work it out with your

screwdriver and once you have it most of
the<00:03:14.440> way<00:03:14.500> through<00:03:14.830> you're<00:03:15.040> gonna<00:03:15.100> want<00:03:15.370> to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the way through you're gonna want to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
the way through you're gonna want to
flip<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.820> back<00:03:16.000> over<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:18.700> square<00:03:19.030> piece<00:03:19.239> is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
flip it back over this square piece is
