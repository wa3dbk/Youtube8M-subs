of<00:00:29.609> marketing<00:00:30.060> reason<00:00:30.390> i<00:00:30.510> guess<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of marketing reason i guess there's a

of marketing reason i guess there's a
marketing<00:00:31.439> reason<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:31.890> maybe<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.369> just

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
marketing reason or maybe they just

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549 
marketing reason or maybe they just
screwed<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.660> their<00:00:33.809> resources

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.160 
and to give you on console yeah which
proves<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> point<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.790> console<00:00:39.690> gaming<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
proves the point that console gaming is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.799 
proves the point that console gaming is
better<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:41.399> kidding<00:00:41.820> check<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.420> day<00:00:42.600> we'll

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
delay a cat another delay just like my

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.689 
delay a cat another delay just like my
period<00:00:50.690> i'm<00:00:51.690> preggers<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.500> correct<00:00:52.770> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
worldwide but that might not be

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.319 
worldwide but that might not be
happening<00:01:02.160> apparently<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:02.940> huge

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
happening apparently there's huge

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
happening apparently there's huge
problems<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> manufacturing<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
problems with the manufacturing of that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
problems with the manufacturing of that
gamepad<00:01:05.880> controller<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> complexity<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
gamepad controller and the complexity of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.399 
gamepad controller and the complexity of
complexity<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> according<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> them

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
complexity of it according to them

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
complexity of it according to them
according<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.710> anonymous<00:01:11.310> sources<00:01:12.000> come

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
according to like anonymous sources come

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
according to like anonymous sources come
on<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.229> could<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.619> garbage<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.400> think

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
on so they could be all garbage I think

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.350 
on so they could be all garbage I think
it's<00:01:14.880> j<00:01:15.090> hooked<00:01:16.880> actually<00:01:17.880> he'd<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.119> saying

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's j hooked actually he'd be saying

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's j hooked actually he'd be saying
the<00:01:18.479> opposite<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.020> amazing<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.530> coming

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the opposite it's amazing it's coming

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
the opposite it's amazing it's coming
out<00:01:19.920> tomorrow<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.790> third<00:01:24.030> news<00:01:24.330> today<00:01:24.750> is

in africa the bones are over two million
years<00:01:31.500> old<00:01:31.710> check<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> link<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> underbar

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
years old check the link in the underbar
for<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> basically<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.430> saying

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
for that so basically they're saying

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.940 
for that so basically they're saying
that<00:01:36.060> along<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.229> were<00:01:37.350> evolving<00:01:37.799> as

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that along what we were evolving as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
that along what we were evolving as
humans<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.030> Homo<00:01:39.329> sapiens

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
humans there is two other Homo sapiens

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
humans there is two other Homo sapiens
that<00:01:40.259> were<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.590> different<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.189> us<00:01:41.390> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that were a little different than us and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
that were a little different than us and
somehow<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.899> survived<00:01:43.350> welcome<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> were

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
somehow he survived welcome you were

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600 
somehow he survived welcome you were
smarter<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:45.149> stronger<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
smarter or stronger or we know how to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
smarter or stronger or we know how to
use<00:01:47.700> hair<00:01:47.970> products<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.780> how<00:01:48.930> we

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
use hair products and that's how we

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.470 
use hair products and that's how we
survive<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.649> guess<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
survive I guess that's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.060 
survive I guess that's
right<00:01:50.660> there<00:01:50.900> remember<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.650> like<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.920> video

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
right there remember to like the video
