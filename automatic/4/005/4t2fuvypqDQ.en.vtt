00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
accessing a pond at one time stupid

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.010 
accessing a pond at one time stupid
assistant<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:01.830> know<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.370> learned<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.690> we

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
assistant you know what I learned you we

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
assistant you know what I learned you we
learned<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:04.740> our<00:02:04.860> successes<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.460> we

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
learned not from our successes right we

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700 
learned not from our successes right we
learned<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.300> fall<00:02:06.690> down<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.530> learn

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
learned when we fall down and we learn

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.639 
learned when we fall down and we learn
how<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.130> back<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.380> what<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> do

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
how to get back up so you know what I do

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.940 
how to get back up so you know what I do
now<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.940> check<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.200> make<00:02:13.380> sure<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
now I actually check to make sure the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.250 
now I actually check to make sure the
rubber<00:02:14.160> dams<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> right<00:02:15.000> tooth<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
rubber dams on the right tooth and it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.750 
rubber dams on the right tooth and it
was<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.710> month<00:02:16.950> ago<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.280> started<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
was about a month ago I started to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280 
was about a month ago I started to
making<00:02:17.970> access<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> new<00:02:18.780> set<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.110> wrong

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
making access a new set was wrong

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.720 
making access a new set was wrong
because<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.830> shouldn't<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.400> tooth

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
because there shouldn't be a tooth

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.340 
because there shouldn't be a tooth
behind<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> was<00:02:21.690> making<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> access

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
behind the one I was making the access

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.440 
behind the one I was making the access
sure<00:02:22.830> enough<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.550> was<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> first<00:02:24.150> molar

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
sure enough it was on the first molar

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930 
sure enough it was on the first molar
and<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.080> second<00:02:25.410> more<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> learned<00:02:26.820> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and not the second more so I learned a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.840 
and not the second more so I learned a
lifetime<00:02:27.600> lesson<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.370> value<00:02:29.550> of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
lifetime lesson and that's the value of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.760 
lifetime lesson and that's the value of
these<00:02:30.120> things<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:31.050> beat<00:02:31.230> yourself<00:02:31.620> up

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
these things is not to beat yourself up

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.740 
these things is not to beat yourself up
but<00:02:32.459> learn<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> lesson<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.300> told<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.630> about

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
but learn the lesson so I told you about

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.770 
but learn the lesson so I told you about
the<00:02:33.990> ex<00:02:34.170> gates<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:36.240> four<00:02:36.540> gates

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the ex gates and it's four gates

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.199 
the ex gates and it's four gates
quitting's<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.160> useful<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:38.910> less

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
quitting's which is useful you know less

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.270 
quitting's which is useful you know less
is<00:02:39.240> more<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.680> told<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
is more and I told you about the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.520 
is more and I told you about the
accesses<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.300> reviewing<00:02:42.780> here<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.440> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
accesses I'm just reviewing here just to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.650 
accesses I'm just reviewing here just to
remind<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.390> okay<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:48.090> percent<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
remind you okay what percent of the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.860 
remind you okay what percent of the
lower<00:02:48.810> interiors<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.530> two<00:02:49.800> canals<00:02:50.870> forty

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
lower interiors have two canals forty

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.949 
lower interiors have two canals forty
percent<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.120> handing<00:02:54.510> out<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
percent so what I'm handing out to you

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.720 
percent so what I'm handing out to you
is<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> sheet<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.650> tells<00:02:56.040> how<00:02:56.280> many<00:02:56.340> canals

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
is a sheet that tells how many canals

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.030 
is a sheet that tells how many canals
are<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.060> each<00:02:57.180> tooth<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.320> actually

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
are in each tooth so you I have actually

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
are in each tooth so you I have actually
have<00:02:59.190> these<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> chair<00:02:59.760> side<00:02:59.970> because<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.959> can't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
have these a chair side because I can't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
have these a chair side because I can't
remember<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.380> ok<00:03:04.380> front<00:03:04.709> teeth<00:03:04.890> cuspid<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
remember so ok front teeth cuspid to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.930 
remember so ok front teeth cuspid to
cuspid<00:03:06.680> you've<00:03:07.680> got<00:03:07.920> triangle<00:03:08.459> one<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.790> two

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
cuspid you've got triangle one and two

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.680 
cuspid you've got triangle one and two
okay<00:03:09.350> now<00:03:10.350> most<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:12.150> watch<00:03:12.330> me<00:03:12.570> now

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
okay now most of you just watch me now

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.470 
okay now most of you just watch me now
most<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> front<00:03:13.830> tooth<00:03:14.239> make<00:03:15.239> your

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
most of you on a front tooth make your

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.390 
most of you on a front tooth make your
access<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.050> too<00:03:16.560> wide<00:03:17.150> when<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:18.300> looking<00:03:18.510> at

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
access is too wide when I'm looking at

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.789 
access is too wide when I'm looking at
accesses<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:21.030> chopped<00:03:21.570> off<00:03:21.780> too<00:03:22.080> much<00:03:22.260> mesial

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
accesses you chopped off too much mesial

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.530 
accesses you chopped off too much mesial
distal<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.370> not<00:03:24.030> enough<00:03:24.420> incisal<00:03:26.480> incisal

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
distal and not enough incisal incisal

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.009 
distal and not enough incisal incisal
apical<00:03:27.930> turn<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.519> now<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> triangle

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
apical turn it so now this is a triangle

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.140 
apical turn it so now this is a triangle
-<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.650> upper<00:03:32.190> tooth<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.790> removing

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
- it's a upper tooth you're removing

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150 
- it's a upper tooth you're removing
triangle<00:03:33.660> -<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.140> come<00:03:34.620> up<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.980> little

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
triangle - you have to come up a little

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.729 
triangle - you have to come up a little
more<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.489> triangle<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.330> even<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.170> adonis<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
more and triangle one even and adonis I

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.440 
more and triangle one even and adonis I
see<00:03:37.950> patients<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.970> they've<00:03:39.209> treated

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
see patients that they've treated

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.630 
see patients that they've treated
they've<00:03:39.959> gone<00:03:40.200> around<00:03:40.410> either<00:03:40.830> triangle<00:03:41.489> one

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
they've gone around either triangle one

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.130 
they've gone around either triangle one
and<00:03:41.820> two<00:03:42.000> or<00:03:42.299> both<00:03:43.940> okay<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.330> make<00:03:45.600> sure<00:03:45.900> you've

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
and two or both okay so make sure you've

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.350 
and two or both okay so make sure you've

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
got the front teeth the triangles are

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.680 
got the front teeth the triangles are
gone<00:03:48.510> which<00:03:49.310> canal<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.820> top<00:03:51.030> teeth<00:03:51.360> has

gone which canal on the top teeth has

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.530 
gone which canal on the top teeth has
the<00:03:51.930> hook<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:53.160> treat<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:54.090> screw<00:03:54.450> it

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the hook on it you treat it you screw it

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.860 
the hook on it you treat it you screw it
up

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
up

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.810 
up
you<00:03:55.080> refer<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.709> endodontist<00:03:56.370> you're

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you refer it to the endodontist you're

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.789 
you refer it to the endodontist you're
always<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.390> treat<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.470> better

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
always going to treat it so you better

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.380 
always going to treat it so you better
remember<00:03:59.040> which<00:03:59.430> one<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.850> which<00:04:00.060> one<00:04:00.239> has

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
remember which one it is which one has

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.630 
remember which one it is which one has
the<00:04:00.420> hook<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:03.140> what<00:04:04.140> which<00:04:04.410> tooth

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the hook it is the what which tooth

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.140 
the hook it is the what which tooth
lateral<00:04:06.390> exactly<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:08.220> if<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.640> know<00:04:08.880> that

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
lateral exactly and if you know that

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
lateral exactly and if you know that
then<00:04:09.930> you've<00:04:10.110> got<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.350> preserve<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:10.950> turn

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
then you've got to preserve that turn

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.920 
then you've got to preserve that turn
otherwise<00:04:12.090> you're<00:04:12.270> going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.540> straight

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
otherwise you're going to be straight

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.030 
otherwise you're going to be straight
and<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.110> hook<00:04:13.260> will<00:04:13.290> still<00:04:13.560> be<00:04:13.710> there<00:04:13.860> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
and the hook will still be there and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.660 
and the hook will still be there and
cause<00:04:14.700> an<00:04:14.910> endo<00:04:15.240> lesion<00:04:15.570> perhaps<00:04:16.670> posterior

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
cause an endo lesion perhaps posterior

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.449 
cause an endo lesion perhaps posterior
teeth<00:04:17.850> also<00:04:18.480> have<00:04:18.660> triangles<00:04:19.230> so<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.430> a

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
teeth also have triangles so this is a

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.330 
teeth also have triangles so this is a
molar<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.239> could<00:04:21.390> be<00:04:21.540> any<00:04:21.780> tooth<00:04:22.200> now<00:04:23.040> if

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
molar but it could be any tooth now if

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.550 
molar but it could be any tooth now if
you<00:04:23.760> look<00:04:24.030> here<00:04:24.060> anybody<00:04:24.900> could<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.320> that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
you look here anybody could see that

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.870 
you look here anybody could see that
because<00:04:25.860> I'm<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.160> here<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.580> look<00:04:26.730> straight

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
because I'm up here I can look straight

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.700 
because I'm up here I can look straight
down<00:04:27.120> but<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.300> can't<00:04:27.660> look<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:28.050> here<00:04:28.320> unless<00:04:28.470> I'm

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
down but I can't look in here unless I'm

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.190 
down but I can't look in here unless I'm
laying<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> chamber<00:04:29.790> floor<00:04:30.200> because

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
laying on the chamber floor because

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.600 
laying on the chamber floor because
there's<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.440> triangle<00:04:32.040> here<00:04:32.220> how<00:04:32.370> do<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
there's a triangle here how do you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.000 
there's a triangle here how do you
remove<00:04:33.510> those<00:04:33.780> two<00:04:34.080> find<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> kitten<00:04:34.770> out

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
remove those two find the kitten out

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.920 
remove those two find the kitten out
remember<00:04:35.250> we're<00:04:35.370> finding<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.850> canal<00:04:36.120> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
remember we're finding the canal so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.810 
remember we're finding the canal so
let's<00:04:37.170> take<00:04:37.380> an<00:04:37.500> example<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:38.070> maxillary<00:04:38.490> molar

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
let's take an example of maxillary molar

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.650 
let's take an example of maxillary molar
and<00:04:39.950> here's<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.190> little<00:04:41.490> peephole<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:42.300> can't

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and here's that little peephole I can't

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.360 
and here's that little peephole I can't
see<00:04:42.930> down<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.320> unless<00:04:43.500> they<00:04:43.680> were<00:04:43.740> laying<00:04:44.070> on

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
see down it unless they were laying on

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.730 
see down it unless they were laying on
the<00:04:45.060> chamber<00:04:45.480> floor<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.990> if<00:04:46.050> we<00:04:46.140> look<00:04:46.290> closer

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
the chamber floor and if we look closer

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.810 
the chamber floor and if we look closer
you<00:04:47.010> can<00:04:47.100> see<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:47.400> better

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
you can see it better

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.510 
you can see it better
so<00:04:48.180> we<00:04:48.300> could<00:04:48.480> use<00:04:48.660> X<00:04:48.960> gates<00:04:49.350> or<00:04:49.620> just<00:04:49.800> an<00:04:49.950> agate

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
so we could use X gates or just an agate

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.390 
so we could use X gates or just an agate
squibbon<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:51.990> forward<00:04:52.560> now<00:04:52.950> I'm<00:04:53.100> looking

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
squibbon just up forward now I'm looking

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.210 
squibbon just up forward now I'm looking
straight<00:04:53.520> down<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.150> now<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.750> own<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.470> then<00:04:56.190> I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
straight down it now I own it and then I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
straight down it now I own it and then I
have<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> chance<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.090> shape<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.780> pack<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.230> in

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
have a chance to shape it and pack it in

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.409 
have a chance to shape it and pack it in
a<00:04:59.630> controlled<00:05:00.630> way

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
a controlled way

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.420 
a controlled way
another<00:05:03.419> maxillary<00:05:03.900> molar<00:05:04.280> finding<00:05:05.280> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
another maxillary molar finding the

canal so with the microscope you're
going<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.700> be<00:05:08.820> able<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.030> see<00:05:09.240> these<00:05:09.390> color

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
going to be able to see these color

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.320 
going to be able to see these color
changes<00:05:10.470> when<00:05:11.130> you're<00:05:11.340> looking<00:05:11.700> for<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> canal

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
and in the tissue who is white go away

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.300

sometimes<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.240> can't<00:05:30.450> find<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.750> canal

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
sometimes you can't find that canal

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.600 
sometimes you can't find that canal
where<00:05:31.200> is<00:05:31.350> it<00:05:31.530> it's<00:05:31.950> another<00:05:32.220> half<00:05:32.490> a

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
where is it it's another half a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.250 
where is it it's another half a
millimeter<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.540> just<00:05:33.720> got<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:33.930> go<00:05:34.080> another

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
millimeter so you just got to go another

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.690 
millimeter so you just got to go another
half<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.590> millimeter<00:05:34.979> but<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.280> have<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.490> go<00:05:35.580> in

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
half a millimeter but you have to go in

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.430 
half a millimeter but you have to go in
the<00:05:35.760> right<00:05:35.910> spot<00:05:36.210> because<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:36.840> go<00:05:37.080> over<00:05:37.260> there

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
the right spot because you go over there

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
the right spot because you go over there
that's<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.740> wrong<00:05:37.890> spot

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
