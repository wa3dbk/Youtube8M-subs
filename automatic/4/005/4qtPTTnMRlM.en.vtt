00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
salad so this is really really an

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900 
salad so this is really really an
important<00:02:30.380> step<00:02:30.620> with<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.950> salad<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.579> make<00:02:31.700> it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
important step with a salad to make it

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.410 
important step with a salad to make it
just<00:02:32.470> extra<00:02:33.470> spacial<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.959> problem<00:02:37.420> right

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
just extra spacial this problem right

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.130 
just extra spacial this problem right
there<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.170> I'm<00:02:39.739> gonna<00:02:39.950> toss<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.430> around

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
there like that I'm gonna toss it around

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.660 
there like that I'm gonna toss it around
to<00:02:42.140> make<00:02:42.170> sure<00:02:42.320> too

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
to make sure too

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.710 
to make sure too
get<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.750> well<00:02:44.930> coded<00:02:49.060> yeah<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.420> see<00:02:50.600> it's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
get it well coded yeah you can see it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.270 
get it well coded yeah you can see it's
getting<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.990> be<00:02:51.080> well<00:02:51.260> coded<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.130> just

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
getting to be well coded and it just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.000 
getting to be well coded and it just
gets<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.580> little<00:02:52.850> caramel<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.330> glaze<00:02:53.630> on<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.010> and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
gets a little caramel a glaze on it and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.290 
gets a little caramel a glaze on it and
another<00:02:55.310> option<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:55.940> even<00:02:56.209> easier

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
another option that's even easier

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.030 
another option that's even easier
because<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:57.020> horrible<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.590> using<00:02:57.860> some

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
because it's horrible is using some

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.820 
because it's horrible is using some
maple<00:02:58.370> syrup<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:01.280> probably<00:03:01.700> about<00:03:01.790> that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
maple syrup that's probably about that

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.220 
maple syrup that's probably about that
turn<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.980> heat<00:03:04.160> off<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.050> throw

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
turn the heat off then I just throw

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.140 
turn the heat off then I just throw
these<00:03:06.380> hot<00:03:06.620> taters<00:03:07.010> right<00:03:07.430> into<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.820> salad

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
these hot taters right into the salad

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.820 
these hot taters right into the salad
even<00:03:08.270> with<00:03:08.450> all<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.780> extra<00:03:09.050> grease<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.650> there

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
even with all that extra grease in there

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.960 
even with all that extra grease in there
and<00:03:10.760> then<00:03:11.120> that's<00:03:11.390> good<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.650> comes

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
and then that's good and it comes

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.660 
and then that's good and it comes
softens<00:03:13.970> up<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.150> greens<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.220> obviously

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
softens up the greens and obviously

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.240 
softens up the greens and obviously
gives<00:03:16.940> them<00:03:17.090> some<00:03:17.300> good<00:03:17.450> flavor<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:19.100> can

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
gives them some good flavor and you can

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.180 
gives them some good flavor and you can
