about to fall off very common with these

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.550 
about to fall off very common with these
antenna<00:02:52.750> let's<00:02:53.750> see<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> spoky<00:02:54.409> they're

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
antenna let's see a spoky they're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.720 
antenna let's see a spoky they're
already<00:02:54.829> broken<00:02:55.159> or<00:02:55.670> about<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.209> fall<00:02:56.390> off<00:02:57.730> just

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
already broken or about to fall off just

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.140 
already broken or about to fall off just
move<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.329> on<00:02:59.420> around<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> no<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> lot<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.000> now

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
move it on around so no a lot to it now

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.110 
move it on around so no a lot to it now
they<00:03:02.389> get<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.230> crane<00:03:04.040> here<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.760> loading

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
they get the crane here the loading

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.839 
they get the crane here the loading
crane<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> goes<00:03:06.829> back<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.250> forth<00:03:07.340> just

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
crane and it goes back and forth just

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.720 
crane and it goes back and forth just
like<00:03:08.290> ones<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.470> seen<00:03:09.739> on<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.220> effect<00:03:10.639> the

cargo train from this year from 2014 the
year<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:14.299> one's<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.599> little<00:03:14.750> tight

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
year this one's a little tight

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.940 
year this one's a little tight
it's<00:03:16.010> plate<00:03:16.430> built<00:03:16.730> right<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:18.680> a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
it's plate built right here so it's a

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.819 
it's plate built right here so it's a
little<00:03:19.340> stiff<00:03:19.780> maybe<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.959> didn't<00:03:21.230> build<00:03:21.680> it

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
little stiff maybe I didn't build it

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.030 
little stiff maybe I didn't build it
just<00:03:21.889> right<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.849> little<00:03:23.629> too<00:03:23.810> tight<00:03:24.109> there<00:03:24.410> it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
just right a little too tight there it

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.680 
just right a little too tight there it
goes<00:03:25.190> back<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.579> forth<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.060> then<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.239> got<00:03:26.449> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
goes back and forth and then you got the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.559 
goes back and forth and then you got the
bench<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.340> lower<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:30.340> yeah<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:32.060> uses

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
bench here the lower it yeah and it uses

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.909 
bench here the lower it yeah and it uses
a<00:03:32.900> method<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:36.079> don't<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.680> much

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
a method that you don't see that much

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.349 
a method that you don't see that much
anymore<00:03:36.980> where<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.730> put<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.599> plate<00:03:39.470> between

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
anymore where you put a plate between

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.839 
anymore where you put a plate between
the<00:03:41.359> sets<00:03:41.629> of<00:03:41.780> studs<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.530> hold<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.949> and<00:03:43.639> these

sitting<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.990> little<00:03:59.260> trough<00:03:59.530> it<00:04:00.190> is

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
sitting in this little trough it is

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.570 
sitting in this little trough it is
basically<00:04:00.940> built<00:04:01.270> out<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.480> flue<00:04:02.380> rails<00:04:02.680> and

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
basically built out of flue rails and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.700 
basically built out of flue rails and
then<00:04:03.730> there's<00:04:03.940> another<00:04:04.060> one<00:04:04.330> over<00:04:04.450> here<00:04:04.990> on

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
then there's another one over here on

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.650 
then there's another one over here on
top<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.130> building<00:04:06.490> two<00:04:06.700> rails<00:04:06.970> stuck

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660

top of the building two rails stuck
close<00:04:07.900> together<00:04:08.290> it's<00:04:09.160> in<00:04:09.250> between<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.810> guess

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
close together it's in between but guess

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.770 
close together it's in between but guess
what<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:12.700> construction<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:14.590> sturdier<00:04:15.250> than

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
what this construction is sturdier than

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.449 
what this construction is sturdier than
the<00:04:16.780> one<00:04:16.989> from<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.530> 2014<00:04:18.220> cargo<00:04:18.640> train<00:04:19.079> 24

2014 cargo train falls apart very easily
all<00:04:25.270> right<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:25.630> let's<00:04:25.840> look<00:04:25.960> at<00:04:26.110> some<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.410> your

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
all right so let's look at some of your

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.760 
all right so let's look at some of your
sticker<00:04:26.740> pieces<00:04:27.220> here<00:04:28.050> says<00:04:29.050> international

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
sticker pieces here says international

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.590 
sticker pieces here says international
transport<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.610> get<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.850> sticker<00:04:31.150> sheet<00:04:31.450> with<00:04:31.570> a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
transport you get a sticker sheet with a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.810 
transport you get a sticker sheet with a
set<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.140> can<00:04:32.170> choose<00:04:32.590> what<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.950> says<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
set and you can choose what it says the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.750 
set and you can choose what it says the
instructions<00:04:34.450> show<00:04:35.260> this<00:04:35.710> which<00:04:36.280> i<00:04:36.400> think<00:04:36.460> is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
instructions show this which i think is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.910 
instructions show this which i think is
