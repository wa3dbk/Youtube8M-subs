orb<00:01:28.289> gel<00:01:28.770> which<00:01:29.450> helps<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> soil<00:01:32.039> hold

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
orb gel which helps the soil hold

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.269 
orb gel which helps the soil hold
moisture<00:01:32.909> better<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.409> crystal<00:01:34.859> powder

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:35.279 
moisture better it's a crystal powder

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:38.089 
moisture better it's a crystal powder
and<00:01:35.880> once<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> gets<00:01:36.840> wet<00:01:37.289> it's<00:01:37.709> going<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
and once it gets wet it's going to

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.969 
and once it gets wet it's going to
expand<00:01:38.849> and<00:01:39.179> hold<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.289> moisture<00:01:40.529> and<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
expand and hold the moisture and you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.339 
expand and hold the moisture and you
only<00:01:41.219> need<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> tiny<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.240> bit<00:01:42.599> for<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> hole

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
only need a tiny little bit for a hole

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.609 
only need a tiny little bit for a hole
the<00:01:43.649> size<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> once<00:01:45.539> that<00:01:45.779> gets<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.289> there<00:01:46.499> I'm

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the size so once that gets in there I'm

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.459 
the size so once that gets in there I'm
going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> combine<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.639> together<00:01:47.849> and

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469

any lumps that might be in there and I'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.789 
any lumps that might be in there and I'm
going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> stir<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.789> up<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.149> best<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.779> can<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
going to stir it up as best as I can so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.209 
going to stir it up as best as I can so
that's<00:01:59.069> all<00:01:59.369> evenly<00:02:00.090> combined<00:02:01.069> tensing<00:02:02.069> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that's all evenly combined tensing it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.880 
that's all evenly combined tensing it
being<00:02:02.459> mixed
