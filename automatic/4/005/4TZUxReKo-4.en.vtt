knowing about them I have been

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.180 
knowing about them I have been

Cretaceous it all begins when the earth
had<00:01:33.609> a<00:01:33.640> single<00:01:34.119> landmass<00:01:34.479> called<00:01:35.020> Pangaea<00:01:35.560> as

the continents shifted over millions of
years<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:39.130> plant<00:01:39.460> life<00:01:39.670> became<00:01:40.149> more<00:01:40.420> diverse

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
years the plant life became more diverse

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.999 
years the plant life became more diverse
and<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.649> dinosaurs<00:01:42.250> grew<00:01:42.609> to<00:01:42.789> gigantic<00:01:43.359> sizes

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and the dinosaurs grew to gigantic sizes

and the dinosaurs grew to gigantic sizes
finally<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.189> we<00:01:45.399> come<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.880> Cretaceous

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
finally as we come to the Cretaceous

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.169 
finally as we come to the Cretaceous
period<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:47.500> see<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.009> most<00:01:48.250> diversity<00:01:49.000> in

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
period we see the most diversity in

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.240

hunted<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.830> packs<00:02:22.030> down<00:02:23.030> near<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.390> Red<00:02:23.540> Deer

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
hunted in packs down near the Red Deer

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
hunted in packs down near the Red Deer
River<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.500> found<00:02:24.950> nine<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.700> these

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
River we have found nine of these

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.030 
River we have found nine of these
animals<00:02:26.360> together<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> that's<00:02:27.890> very

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
animals together so that's very

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.340 
animals together so that's very
interesting<00:02:28.160> lots<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.090> people<00:02:29.390> never<00:02:30.140> would

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
interesting lots of people never would

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.290 
interesting lots of people never would
have<00:02:30.440> considered<00:02:30.650> something<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.790> reptile

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
have considered something like a reptile

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.580 
have considered something like a reptile
to<00:02:33.050> be<00:02:33.170> capable<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.920> hunting<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.640> groups<00:02:35.590> this

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
to be capable of hunting in groups this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.980 
to be capable of hunting in groups this
is<00:02:36.650> actually<00:02:37.070> probably<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.060> last

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
is actually probably one of the last

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.230 
is actually probably one of the last
dinosaurs<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.830> roam<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.040> earth<00:02:40.240> Triceratops

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
dinosaurs to roam the earth Triceratops

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.300 
dinosaurs to roam the earth Triceratops
is<00:02:41.390> quite<00:02:41.600> an<00:02:41.720> interesting<00:02:42.010> dinosaur<00:02:43.010> because

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
is quite an interesting dinosaur because

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.860 
is quite an interesting dinosaur because
we<00:02:43.490> actually<00:02:43.760> find<00:02:43.970> lots<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.300> evidence<00:02:44.690> for

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
we actually find lots of evidence for

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.230 
we actually find lots of evidence for
interaction<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.650> other<00:02:45.830> dinosaurs<00:02:46.400> in

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
interaction with other dinosaurs in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360 
interaction with other dinosaurs in
Saskatchewan<00:02:47.959> they<00:02:48.110> found<00:02:48.380> specimen<00:02:48.980> where

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
Saskatchewan they found specimen where

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.160 
Saskatchewan they found specimen where
there's<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.760> large<00:02:50.060> piece<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.720> frill<00:02:50.990> on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
there's a large piece of the frill on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.140 
there's a large piece of the frill on
the<00:02:51.260> back<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.800> head<00:02:52.040> missing<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.940> bones

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the back of the head missing the bones

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.850 
the back of the head missing the bones
healing<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.959> know<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.380> animal

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
healing so we know that the animal

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.430 
healing so we know that the animal
survived<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:56.270> there<00:02:56.570> are<00:02:56.660> teeth<00:02:56.930> marks<00:02:56.959> in

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
survived but there are teeth marks in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.290 
survived but there are teeth marks in
the<00:02:57.530> wound<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:57.950> they<00:02:58.070> look<00:02:58.250> like<00:02:58.430> t-rex<00:02:58.730> teeth

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
the wound and they look like t-rex teeth

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.729 
the wound and they look like t-rex teeth
marks<00:02:59.660> so<00:02:59.810> there's<00:02:59.989> good<00:03:00.200> evidence<00:03:00.380> for

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
marks so there's good evidence for

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.590 
marks so there's good evidence for
interactions<00:03:01.520> between<00:03:01.700> t-rex<00:03:02.360> and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
interactions between t-rex and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.670 
interactions between t-rex and
Triceratops

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
Triceratops

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.190 
Triceratops
this<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> Tyrannosaurus<00:03:05.120> Rex<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.720> dinosaur

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
this is Tyrannosaurus Rex the dinosaur

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.320 
this is Tyrannosaurus Rex the dinosaur
that's<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.980> famous<00:03:07.250> we<00:03:07.610> actually<00:03:07.940> give<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.270> a

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
that's so famous we actually give it a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.360 
that's so famous we actually give it a
nickname<00:03:08.510> we<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.050> call<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.200> t-rex<00:03:09.800> so<00:03:10.130> this

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
nickname we just call it t-rex so this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.479 
nickname we just call it t-rex so this
is<00:03:10.550> arguably<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.690> most<00:03:11.870> iconic<00:03:12.310> species<00:03:13.310> of

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
is arguably the most iconic species of

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.300 
is arguably the most iconic species of
all<00:03:13.610> time<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.410> found<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.010> Alberta

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
all time it is found here in Alberta

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.850 
all time it is found here in Alberta
it's<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.700> North<00:03:16.910> American<00:03:17.060> dinosaur<00:03:17.959> we<00:03:18.560> found

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
it's a North American dinosaur we found

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860 
it's a North American dinosaur we found
a<00:03:19.280> few<00:03:19.580> in<00:03:19.790> Alberta<00:03:20.239> there's<00:03:20.540> one<00:03:20.720> in

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
a few in Alberta there's one in

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.690 
a few in Alberta there's one in
Saskatchewan<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.800> then<00:03:21.950> there's<00:03:22.160> maybe

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
Saskatchewan and then there's maybe

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.610 
Saskatchewan and then there's maybe
about<00:03:22.970> ten<00:03:23.300> or<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.930> states<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.500> we

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
about ten or so in the states that we

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.490 
about ten or so in the states that we
found<00:03:24.890> interestingly<00:03:25.670> enough<00:03:26.420> about<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.170> month

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
found interestingly enough about a month

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.410 
found interestingly enough about a month
or<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.830> ago<00:03:27.860> they<00:03:28.519> found<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.850> species<00:03:29.269> of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
or so ago they found a species of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990 
or so ago they found a species of
Tyrannosaur<00:03:29.630> called<00:03:30.350> u<00:03:30.560> tyrannous<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.670> was
