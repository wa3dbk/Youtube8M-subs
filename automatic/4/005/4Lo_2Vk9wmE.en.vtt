when I was playing was a lot of the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.700 
when I was playing was a lot of the
information<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.409> need

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
information you need

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890

it's right on the player sheets right so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's right on the player sheets right so
when<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> play<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.890> really

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when you got you now to play it's really

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.990
