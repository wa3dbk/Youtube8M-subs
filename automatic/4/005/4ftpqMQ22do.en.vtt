play<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.309> trap<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.290> requires<00:00:56.739> a

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
play and it's a trap and it requires a

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:05.490 
play and it's a trap and it requires a
speed<00:00:57.699> threat<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.809> be<00:00:58.960> overcome<00:01:01.409> let's<00:01:04.500> let's

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
speed threat to be overcome let's let's

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.149 
speed threat to be overcome let's let's
do<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.869> he<00:01:08.409> really<00:01:08.590> hasn't<00:01:08.860> been<00:01:09.070> able

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
do this the he really hasn't been able

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.190 
do this the he really hasn't been able
to<00:01:09.340> do<00:01:09.460> anything<00:01:09.790> much<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.540> Paladin<00:01:10.990> so

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
to do anything much to the Paladin so

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.590 
to do anything much to the Paladin so
far<00:01:11.500> but<00:01:11.770> we're<00:01:11.920> going<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.130> move<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:13.240> peril

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
far but we're going to move the peril

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770 
far but we're going to move the peril
down<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.930> seven<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:14.939> bring<00:01:15.939> out<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.119> poison

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
down to seven and bring out a poison

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.609 
down to seven and bring out a poison
cloud<00:01:17.049> trap<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.780> time<00:01:20.080> for<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
cloud trap and then it's time for the

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.950 
cloud trap and then it's time for the
Paladin<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.369> overcome<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.360> threat<00:01:22.659> with<00:01:22.930> a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
Paladin to overcome the threat with a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
Paladin to overcome the threat with a
speed<00:01:23.380> roll<00:01:23.680> he's<00:01:24.009> got<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> speed<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.820> three<00:01:25.780> now

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
speed roll he's got a speed of three now

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.249 
speed roll he's got a speed of three now
so<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.820> don't<00:01:28.150> know<00:01:28.240> how<00:01:28.270> dangerous<00:01:29.049> this<00:01:29.200> is

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
so I don't know how dangerous this is

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.810 
so I don't know how dangerous this is
going<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.619> be<00:01:30.060> he's<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> 6<00:01:31.570> or<00:01:31.810> higher<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.820> he

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
going to be he's a 6 or higher and he

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.749 
going to be he's a 6 or higher and he
succeeds<00:01:34.420> he<00:01:34.749> rolled<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.229> four<00:01:35.289> four<00:01:36.249> plus

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
succeeds he rolled a four four plus

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.010 
succeeds he rolled a four four plus
three<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.869> seven<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.670> overcomes<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.659> threat

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
three is seven that overcomes the threat

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.959 
three is seven that overcomes the threat
and<00:01:41.319> this<00:01:41.469> ends<00:01:41.979> up<00:01:42.069> giving<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:43.569> Paladin<00:01:44.319> a

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
and this ends up giving the Paladin a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.840 
and this ends up giving the Paladin a
point<00:01:45.969> of<00:01:46.210> glory<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.159> one's<00:01:48.520> sort<00:01:48.700> of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
point of glory so that one's sort of

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.410 
point of glory so that one's sort of
backfired

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.240 

moving<00:01:53.320> down<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.799> list<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.590> now<00:01:56.799> time<00:01:56.830> to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
moving down the list it is now time to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.320 
moving down the list it is now time to
go<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.090> build<00:01:58.450> phase<00:01:59.049> for<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> darkling

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
go to the build phase for the darkling

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.760 
go to the build phase for the darkling
because<00:02:01.330> he<00:02:01.540> has<00:02:01.659> no<00:02:01.899> other<00:02:02.080> dungeon<00:02:02.560> more

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
because he has no other dungeon more

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.620 
because he has no other dungeon more
cards<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.250> play<00:02:05.430> we've<00:02:06.430> drawn<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:07.030> map<00:02:07.060> tile

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
cards to play we've drawn a map tile

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.840 
cards to play we've drawn a map tile
which<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> simple<00:02:08.800> turn<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:14.700> let's<00:02:15.700> just

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
which is a simple turn and let's just

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.699 
which is a simple turn and let's just
put<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.569> here<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.230> upper<00:02:20.260> right

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
put that up here in the upper right

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.290 
put that up here in the upper right
corner<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.459> really<00:02:21.700> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.910> do<00:02:22.090> much

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
corner it's not really going to do much

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.170 
corner it's not really going to do much
except<00:02:22.959> just<00:02:23.489> connect<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.610> couple<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.000> rooms

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
except just connect a couple of rooms

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.150 
except just connect a couple of rooms
together<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.930> block<00:02:26.200> off<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.470> corner<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
together and block off that corner and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.630 
together and block off that corner and
then<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.370> move<00:02:30.580> down<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.239> hero<00:02:31.870> face<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
then we move down to the hero face the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.930 
then we move down to the hero face the
darkling<00:02:34.150> has<00:02:34.360> two<00:02:34.780> movement<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:36.549> he<00:02:36.700> really

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
darkling has two movement but he really

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.580 
darkling has two movement but he really
doesn't<00:02:37.269> have<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> place<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.739> go<00:02:40.140> because<00:02:41.140> his

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
doesn't have a place to go because his

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.979 
doesn't have a place to go because his
quest<00:02:42.100> location<00:02:42.850> cards<00:02:43.269> are<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
quest location cards are not on the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.570 
quest location cards are not on the
board<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.269> let's<00:02:46.269> try<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.019> get<00:02:47.410> some<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
board so let's try to get some on the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.390 
board so let's try to get some on the
board<00:02:48.850> let's<00:02:49.120> spend<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.810> point<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.530> movement

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
