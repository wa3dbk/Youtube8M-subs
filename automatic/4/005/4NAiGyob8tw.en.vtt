00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
finger but really is a fork ball is I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
finger but really is a fork ball is I
spread<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.580> fingers<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.359> further<00:00:24.689> than

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
spread my fingers out a lot further than

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.970 
spread my fingers out a lot further than
a<00:00:25.380> normal<00:00:26.060> split<00:00:27.060> finger<00:00:27.800> okay

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a normal split finger okay

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
a normal split finger okay
and<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.760> doing<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> more<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and what I'm doing this is more of a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.299 
and what I'm doing this is more of a
slip<00:00:30.900> pitch<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.679> throwing<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
slip pitch and when I'm throwing this

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
slip pitch and when I'm throwing this
I'm<00:00:32.640> letting<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:34.320> trying<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.829> as

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I'm letting it just I'm trying to get as

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
I'm letting it just I'm trying to get as
least<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.090> least<00:00:36.329> amount<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> friction<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
least the least amount of friction as I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
least the least amount of friction as I
can<00:00:37.590> behind<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> baseball<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.790> just

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
can behind the baseball and it's just

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
can behind the baseball and it's just
gonna<00:00:39.030> slip<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
gonna slip out and it's gonna have a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.119 
gonna slip out and it's gonna have a
knuckle<00:00:41.399> income<00:00:41.879> bling<00:00:42.149> kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> movement

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
knuckle income bling kind of movement

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.060 
knuckle income bling kind of movement
sometimes<00:00:44.870> ideally<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> righty<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
sometimes ideally I want as a righty I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.569 
sometimes ideally I want as a righty I
want<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> tumble<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> fall<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> into

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
want it to tumble and fall down and into

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
want it to tumble and fall down and into
a<00:00:50.610> righty<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> times<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
a righty but a lot of the times when I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.619 
a righty but a lot of the times when I
throw<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.510> almost<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:56.190> almost<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
throw it it almost it almost it's like a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.810 
throw it it almost it almost it's like a
knuckle<00:00:57.930> slider<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.489> moves<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> bunch<00:01:01.820> but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
knuckle slider it's it moves a bunch but

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
knuckle slider it's it moves a bunch but
it<00:01:02.940> moves<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.870> away<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.710> righty

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it moves down and away from a righty

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
it moves down and away from a righty
ideally<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
ideally I would like it to go down and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
ideally I would like it to go down and
in<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> does<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> lot<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.189> most<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in and it does a lot but most of the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.730 
in and it does a lot but most of the
time<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> goes<00:01:09.210> down<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> away<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> very

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
time it goes down and away it's a very

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.850 
time it goes down and away it's a very
very<00:01:11.159> hard<00:01:11.460> pitch<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> control<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.590> you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
very hard pitch to control so if you're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
very hard pitch to control so if you're
having<00:01:14.040> control<00:01:14.640> issues<00:01:14.700> already<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.479> wouldn't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
having control issues already I wouldn't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
having control issues already I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:15.930> throwing<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> also<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
suggest throwing this but it's also a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
suggest throwing this but it's also a
very<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:18.030> tough<00:01:18.270> pitch<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> hit<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
very very tough pitch to hit so and and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.030 
very very tough pitch to hit so and and
again<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.229> guys<00:01:22.409> called<00:01:22.740> me<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.009> on

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
again you know you guys called me out on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.039 
again you know you guys called me out on
it<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it and you're right this is more of a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
it and you're right this is more of a
more<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> fork<00:01:26.250> ball<00:01:26.400> than<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.820> split<00:01:27.420> finger

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
more of a fork ball than a split finger

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
more of a fork ball than a split finger

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that video the split finger is more just

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
that video the split finger is more just
real<00:01:35.670> quick<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:36.869> closer

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
real quick is more a little bit closer

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
real quick is more a little bit closer
