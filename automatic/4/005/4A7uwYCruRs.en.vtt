00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 [music] 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.779
 the first warm days of great reason 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.970
 relax in nature 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.639
 snowdrops animals joyfully 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.500
 meeting spring sun and of course 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 satisfied faces of others 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.230
 but in order to capture all this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 beauty needs not just a soap dish but 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 universal camera with good zoom 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.880
 for example, canon powershot sx 410 a.s. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 the device is made in a convenient form factor 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 with a big grip on the handle there 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 non-slip rubber insert 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 the assembly is very high quality plastic 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.680
 the middle part creaks and does not bend 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.079
 The lens is edged wide 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 metal ring if the black version 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.840
 Seems boring to eat bright red by 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.930
 the number of controls shows that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.340
 the camera is designed for those who do not like 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 bother with the settings on top 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 shutter release with zoom lever and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.690
 power button flash rises 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.680
 manually as they say the easier it is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410
 more reliable 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.510
 on the back are five buttons 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.170
 video change shooting mode view 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.479
 snapshots 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.909
 display additional information and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 menu as well as a standard joystick 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 3-inch screen by modern standards 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 frankly weak in the picture with 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.990
 a resolution of 230,000 dots well noticeable 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.810
 pixel grid wide viewing angles 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.939
 and the high brightness display is also not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 differs even at maximum 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.850
 settings 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 sometimes it's hard to look at anything 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 bright sun 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 the interface here is only one menu and rebuild 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.850
 audio output from computer camera 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.610
 not charging pictures are saved on sd 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 card with support for hd x sim card 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.399
 64 gigabytes of work without 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.990
 problems near installed 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.680
 Lithium-ion battery is almost the same 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 size 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.930
 800 milliamper hours of his 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.200
 enough for 200 250 frames that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.329
 naturally and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.390
 yeah the resolution of images in this model 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.090
 has grown to 20 megapixels so that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.939
 small sensor played a dual role 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.310
 one side of the photo is very good 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.009
 amenable to scaling it certainly 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.140
 like lovers looking at small 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.569
 parts with different high density 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.819
 pixels increases the amount of noise and 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.130
 artifacts in poor light 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.400
 but that clearly played a benefit 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.400
 so this is a zoom lens increase from 30 to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.349
 40 crab slight decrease 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.640
 focal lengths at focal length 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.220
 nine hundred and sixty millimeters on 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.890
 the quality of the photos did not affect now 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 the camera has become even more versatile with 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.370
 long distance can shoot 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.370
 closeup of wild birds 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.920
 animals various sights 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.140
 and other objects that are not possible 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 move closer zoom function plus 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 allows you to double the multiplicity of the lens for 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.950
 digital approximation score but result 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.540
 will be the same as when increasing 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.120
 pictures in the editor 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.250
 although if needed right on the spot 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.500
 something to consider such a function may 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.049
 be useful remote objects not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.930
 the only thing that can do with this camera 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.760
 a minimum focal length of 24 millimeters is possible 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.190
 no problem shooting landscapes 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.859
 architecture or a large group of friends 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.530
 pleased and macro 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.239
 the camera is confidently focused on objects 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.910
 near the lens itself 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.190
 however, the declared distance is 0 centimeters 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.200
 turned out to be a slight exaggeration 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.480
 Do not forget about the optical 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.549
 stabilization with efficiency up to 2 s 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.150
 half exposure 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.069
 in the evening she does not always save but in the afternoon 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.500
 significantly increases the chances of success 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.260
 pictures in general, the device works quite 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.540
 fast menu does not freeze focus 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.549
 forced to wait for a few seconds and 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.370
 that is why in the presence of a powerful 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.799
 digic 4 processor + camera does 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.380
 maximum half frames per second 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.450
 riddle as already mentioned shoot this 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.030
 camera is very easy for beginners 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.530
 Specially designed auto live mode in 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.709
 which can change some 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.690
 shooting settings brightness balance of colors and 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.450
 us 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.490
 and in the digital filter mode is available 6 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.860
 different effects in case 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.990
 I want to experiment with the plot 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.700
 There is also a program mode where you can 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.220
 manually change settings 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.210
 white balance sensitivity and method 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.940
 expo metering 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.980
 video is recorded in dice mono sound 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.650
 expect from such a resolution something 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.990
 supernatural would be unwise 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.240
 the quality of the rollers is quite standard 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.760
 the details do not shine but rather 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.300
 smoothly and even when using 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.820
 maximum zoom 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.340
 this is a lot of intellectual merit 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.380
 four axial stabilization system 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.990
 dynamic pictures are also possible 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.750
 apply different digital filters 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.500
 miniature effect monochrome super bright 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.870
 or poster canon powershot sx 410a with 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.820
 great example of a combination of simple 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.800
 control and powerful zoom 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.870
 novice photographer will not have to 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.730
 overpay for a bunch of unnecessary features 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.890
 neither will he feel 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.560
 deprived of course because of the weak 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.570
 battery this camera will not be the best 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.610
 choice for long journeys 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.830
 but thanks to the light and compact 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.780
 body, it is great for 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.100
 short trips and 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:22.519
 smart walks 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:22.519
