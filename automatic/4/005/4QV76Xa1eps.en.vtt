00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.300
 hello to everyone today i will tell show 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.219
 you are my favorite method of creation 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.500
 luxurious bohemian waves without any 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.660
 ploek or irons, and so all we 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 will need this comb 2 not spoiling 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.810
 hair gum 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 jump off the building waves of ordinary or 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 beach but by itself our hair on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.439
 not quite normal state I minutes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150
 fifteen like from a shower and during that time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 my hair is quite decent 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 dry because if your hair 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 will be too wet that's all you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 get when it 's time to enjoy 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 the hairstyle is all the same wet hair and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 so we start with the fact that very carefully 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 combing our hair because they 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 formations are still able to break down 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 we do not want to by itself and after we share 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 our side in two parts 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 in the middle and lower our entry jump 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 from the building in principle this convention if 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.329
 your hair swell like my 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 for example, I checked and without press super 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 but if your hair of nature is straight and that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 you need spray 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.520
 so evenly spray and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100
 once we comb our hair in order to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
 distribute it across the line and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.130
 look who came to do us together 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.530
 hairstyle this is my cat margle she 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 always comes when shoot a video like that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.030
 that she loves you guys too 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.090
 and finally when we are satisfied 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.479
 The amount of spray on the hair can be 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.979
 go to create out with 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.390
 weaving 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.369
 by the way those who watch the past video about 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.979
 rampage hairstyle learn here technique from 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.780
 second option and indeed we all 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.460
 we will also twist the strand 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 all new and new to what is already there 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.530
 the only difference is that you are a trance you 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 will need to weave the end here 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.909
 wrap it all in a bun and neatly 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.219
 secure with a rubber band understand and we do 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.689
 all the same with the second side and for 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.789
 our hair as a result 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.590
 steel wavy need to give them 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.780
 dry until the end of this position 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.579
 so the best and easiest way to do it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.439
 for the night and then for the morning we get here 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.209

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.369
 time better not to touch the comb I just 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.280

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.810
