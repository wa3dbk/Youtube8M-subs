00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.710
 and hello to all of you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 find for a new draw again 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 unpacking number 6 with a question game 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.969
 contest I even released the check list 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 when it was used for that and I checked 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 to find out which cards I had 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 already we see that it starts well 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 to fill up one is not yet at the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 half but 50% approach 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 so here we are going to shoot we'll see if the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.970
 luck smiles us again 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 hazards we start with the package of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 left as usual lubitsch 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 luscious lubitsch that had been said a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 which remained to us more than a map and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 it's past slip is a team card 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 to complete the herzegovina bosnia 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 so that's a double or we put 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.320
 that in double helpen mcgeady I do not 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 did not have it so it's a one to watch 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 one to watch I do not have much 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:58.199
 because I had 15 and zoran tosic 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 so it's a good map to at 45 and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 that's the last one it's the last 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 of Bosnia and Herzegovina 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.380
 we see 45 so first teams 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
 incompleteness arrivals is bosnia 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.530
 Herzegovina 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 that 's how it may be about game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 contest to whom her breasts 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.990
 attention attention I say maybe I 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.250
 do not know we'll see in the end surely 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.450
 I put it at the end of the video 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 england the logo 9 i did not have it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.619
 no it's not 908 number 8 so I 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.070
 I had not it made a card more 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:37.409
 aleksandar dragovic number 137 137 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.960
 look at 137,7 a double so that's it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 one more double is painful enough 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 but hey two ways it's normal he 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.180
 should have about a third of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 double at the stage where I'm so big 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.840
 and who I did not have it so it's good 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.310
 it completes and a little more 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.369
 the poland team 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 this is the first package the second 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.180
 marchisio I did not marchisio 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.899
 so that's fine it's complete 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.729
 the italy team 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.230
 here at the waters is to have a second 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.290
 game 'change 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.210
 it's not insignificant it's zlatan 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.970
 ibrahimovic with heavy also a small 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.110
 little less than cristiano ronaldo the 332 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.010
 and 333 that and oh that's nice it's the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.410
 swedish in game challenger at and ben 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.710
 very very well that very very well the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.620
 game 'change I got it here it made me 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.210
 in it make me 2 with with zlatan 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.890
 ibrahimovic on the other hand I have a lot of 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.970
 dynamo favorite people the panels 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.950
 rampart against the stopper ghouls 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.350
 left stopper I have not bad 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 whereas the logic would be that the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.790
 sapling stopper are in number 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.800
 how much now I can not reach 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.680
 the effect the focus gaulle stopper 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.130
 new there is one by nine pack 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.780
 So I have that you put a 5.9 to 5.45 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.000
 if they play around 45 packets but in any 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.230
 case it's not my more the taste of the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.160
 Sweden very well 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.600
 we are very, very happy that I am 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.610
 content 184 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.020
 is it a double yeah that's 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.690
 a shinji double that 38 this is a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.760
 double since the bosnia zioui no there 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.990
 completed it and mandzukic I had it 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.630
 not the Croatian striker 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.080
 so it's not bad with debates note 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.730
 especially in attack very well very well 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:31.530
 let's move on to the next package at the hmr this is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.840
 a double of 136 pretty double bros 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.340
 the beach 258 rising star I had it 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.020
 already turkey that I did not have it so 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 that complete do not know I do not have much 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.200
 of turkish one there it complements a little bit 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.530
 plus turkey 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:52.160
 it's very good behrami 230 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.020
 it's a new Swiss very very well 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.820
 eden hazard big notes also in 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.280
 team i doi is in game 'change too 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.280
 I think but here it is the teamfight to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.520
 244 so very good for belgium 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.590
 marco v rake it's double so 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.380
 here we go and tackle the last package 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 we were going 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.290
 faster one designed with the little board 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.250
 there we can see immediately the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.450
 doubles so we can right now 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.040
 dismissed what we already have 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.510
 so it's not bad so it was done 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.870
 for that the check list there is a lot 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.220
 players 500 cards to discover 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.640
 m face on is about three doubles 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.760
 by marc package but between 2 and 3 double 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.590
 in packages now the logo of the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.570

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.730
 well that completes toni kroos ans dynamo 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.960
 I did not have dynamos that go 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.810
 to reach completeness finally has to 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.120

 that's okay very good very good note 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.900
 excellent at 145 sni but it's true 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.610
 I have a lot of guards so that 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.280
 it's double again and it will be the 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.450
 last map of this pack so here is 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.780
 contest questions 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.270
 what game 'change again she 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.650
 succeeds in having among those who 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.420
 was left I had many but 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.870
 which and I've just had in this 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.940
 print 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.490
 what is this game 'change that I 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.940
 had been looking for a long time 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.470
 not bad 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.600
 and that's it to complement each other so that I 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.130
 make crosses where there is new 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.070
 and then we have a pretty video 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.360
 short 5 minutes and so that's it 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.520
 reduced with this little checklist that 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.170
 appears iron shorter videos but 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.710
 good if I if I talk a lot too 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.600
 so 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.120
 so we'll meet again very soon 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.760
 in any case for it to be a video 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.340
 unpacking or of course the small final 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.200
 and the grand finale final of the copa 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.200
