 from the London company three different 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 Groups are mortadella ham

 protected in Italy but found in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 Canada 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.550
 let us now listen to the considerations 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.469
 about these new discoveries of the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.100
 trading director of the marco group 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100
 macor ig 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.090
 the first consideration is one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 great surprise after a year of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 work we started from the ham of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 san daniele 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 we arrived at the san mortadella 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.980
 daniele also crossing the frico the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 provolone cheese under asiago 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 various shapes in a tray in the envelope the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.359
 Friulian to the mini Friulian well we think 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 that we have in this work year 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.689
 seen almost everything from the point of view of the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 cheeses 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.729
 our business is also continuing 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 as for the wine the pasta ai 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.670
 typical products of the made in Italy as 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.740
 said a huge initial surprise 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 which thus puts us in a condition of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 great reflection also because in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.869
 this time where many companies 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 have great difficulties to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.430
 export typical products 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.740
 we are faced with these 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.619
 operations that also from the point of view 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.200
 geographically a case for all the famous 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.070
 Friulian cheese represented with the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 tower of pisa 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 here we are, according to us we have touched 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.899
 really the bottom because not only 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.310
 we have to talk about food and wine 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.430
 we have to talk about cheeses we have to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.920
 talk about quality products 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 but we probably have to teach the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.800
 geography 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 I am convinced that the operations of 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 coarketing also for promotion 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.940
 of the territory are extremely 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.090
 important but in front of these products 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.600
 in front of this image is the case of 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.490
 immediately create a table where 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.560
 authorities make their own part i 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
 Consortia do their part to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
 companies do their part that is 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.360
 all together never like now I play of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.850
 team becomes extremely important 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.400
 to define what is made in Italy 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.180
 if necessary, continue on this 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.090
 street or even with the new market 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.390
 with the new economic situation 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.630
 presents now at the beginning of 2009 is not 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.650
 the case of creating also a new road 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.530
 mail and sel in italy ie to make known 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.110
 the territory the product invite the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.590
 people to visit the cellars i 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.049
 check dairies for yourself how 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.570
 a product is born as it is produced 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.700
 as it is then preserved it is also put 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.280
 all these things for sale 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.280
 normally around the world 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.620
 we don't find them we find a product 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.600
 that behind the Italian flag behind 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 the made in italy 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.250
 normally to the name or in the case of 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.920
 ham and mortadella san 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.580
 daniele and there is also an image that 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.019
 Gastronomy recalls Italianism but 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.830
 it has nothing to do with products 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.920
 original 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.830
 that's why a scream right now 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.950
 of alarm on this that can become 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.890
 a big problem for the future 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.230
 I know that many efforts have been made 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.049
 even during the most but in this 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.959
 moment must absolutely continue 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.900
 on this road and be very united 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.590
 in team play to be able to defend 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.590
 the made in italy
