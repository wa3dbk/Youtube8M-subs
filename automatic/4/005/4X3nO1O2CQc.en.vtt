I've<00:00:42.680> got<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:43.190> pretty<00:00:43.580> good<00:00:43.880> layer<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.690> wax

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
I've got a pretty good layer of wax

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.510 
I've got a pretty good layer of wax
going<00:00:45.830> on<00:00:46.010> here

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
going on here

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.980 
going on here
we've<00:00:47.329> put<00:00:47.600> about<00:00:48.140> five<00:00:48.530> layers<00:00:48.890> down<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.630> I'm

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
we've put about five layers down so I'm

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.790 
we've put about five layers down so I'm
cutting<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.840> I<00:00:53.840> am<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:56.200> free<00:00:57.200> designing

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
cutting in and I am just free designing

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920 
cutting in and I am just free designing
I<00:00:57.829> mean<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.100> might<00:00:58.579> decide<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.630> what<00:00:59.810> you

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
I mean you might decide that what you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.820 
I mean you might decide that what you
would<00:01:00.110> like<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.350> do<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:01.360> work<00:01:02.360> with<00:01:05.830> little

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
would like to do is work with little

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.960 
would like to do is work with little
stencils<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.409> if<00:01:09.409> I've<00:01:10.010> got<00:01:10.070> stencils<00:01:10.729> right

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
stencils and if I've got stencils right

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.920 
stencils and if I've got stencils right
here<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.860> might<00:01:13.250> decide<00:01:13.610> well<00:01:13.940> what<00:01:14.810> I'd

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
here and so I might decide well what I'd

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.200 
here and so I might decide well what I'd
really<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.620> do<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:17.229> get<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.290> couple<00:01:18.740> of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
really like to do is get a couple of

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.380 
really like to do is get a couple of
very<00:01:20.210> precise<00:01:21.549> circles<00:01:22.549> running<00:01:22.760> down<00:01:23.150> this

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
very precise circles running down this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.600 
very precise circles running down this
thing<00:01:25.720> round<00:01:26.720> shapes<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.159> could<00:01:28.310> use<00:01:28.460> this

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
thing round shapes so you could use this

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.460 
thing round shapes so you could use this
you<00:01:28.909> can<00:01:28.940> use<00:01:29.210> stencils<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.049> can<00:01:30.350> go

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
you can use stencils you can you can go

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.260 
you can use stencils you can you can go
freehand<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.340> completely<00:01:31.729> depends<00:01:32.150> on

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
freehand it to completely depends on

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.030 
freehand it to completely depends on
what<00:01:32.420> you're<00:01:32.600> interested<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.110> doing<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
what you're interested in doing but the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.090 
what you're interested in doing but the
whole<00:01:34.280> idea<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.290> we're<00:01:36.470> doing<00:01:36.680> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
whole idea is that what we're doing is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.230 
whole idea is that what we're doing is
we're<00:01:37.880> gagging<00:01:38.450> out<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.500> wax<00:01:39.710> we're<00:01:40.610> creating

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
we're gagging out the wax we're creating

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.800 
we're gagging out the wax we're creating
these<00:01:41.420> little<00:01:42.640> valleys<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.970> now<00:01:44.180> need<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.659> be

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
these little valleys that now need to be

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.440 
these little valleys that now need to be
filled<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.310> I'm<00:01:46.460> going<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.970> fill<00:01:47.210> them

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
filled and so I'm going to fill them

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.830 
filled and so I'm going to fill them
with<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:48.830> coal<00:01:49.220> we<00:01:49.700> are<00:01:49.909> all<00:01:50.299> over<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.810> place

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
with a coal we are all over the place

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.990 
with a coal we are all over the place
here<00:01:51.320> our<00:01:51.500> way<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:51.979> that's<00:01:52.189> not<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.430> problem

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
here our way but that's not a problem

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.670 
here our way but that's not a problem
I<00:01:53.650> rush<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.920> very<00:01:55.250> loaded<00:01:55.580> which<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.420> great<00:01:56.750> so

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
things that you can do with drips so

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.400 
things that you can do with drips so
while<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.340> those<00:02:12.580> drips<00:02:13.030> they're<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:17.080> yet

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
I'm gonna actually throw a few trips up

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.030 
I'm gonna actually throw a few trips up
there<00:02:20.920> which<00:02:21.670> all<00:02:21.880> fuse<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.540> minute<00:02:23.770> we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
there which all fuse in a minute we

there which all fuse in a minute we
go<00:02:24.160> back<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.640> scraper<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.260> need<00:02:26.500> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
go back to the scraper that we need so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.699 
go back to the scraper that we need so
so<00:02:28.239> desperately<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.260> good<00:02:29.470> thing<00:02:29.680> about

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
so desperately and the good thing about

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.460 
so desperately and the good thing about
this<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:31.270> want<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.600> start<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:32.020> scrape<00:02:32.410> away

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this is you want to start to scrape away

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.860 
this is you want to start to scrape away
the<00:02:33.660> excess<00:02:35.069> wax<00:02:37.080> fairly<00:02:38.080> early<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.580> game

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the excess wax fairly early in the game

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
the excess wax fairly early in the game
when<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.260> are<00:02:41.620> doing<00:02:42.070> embedding<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.570> do<00:02:43.750> it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
when you are doing embedding we do it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.370 
when you are doing embedding we do it
gently<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.680> if<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.970> early<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.160> job<00:02:48.160> is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
gently and if you do it early the job is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.570 
gently and if you do it early the job is
easier<00:02:50.380> because<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.390> wax<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:53.440> soft<00:02:53.920> again<00:02:54.430> I'm

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
easier because the wax is soft again I'm

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.470 
easier because the wax is soft again I'm
putting<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:55.660> color<00:02:56.160> back<00:02:57.160> into<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> pot<00:02:58.180> if

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
putting my color back into the pot if

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.479

it's<00:02:58.720> clean<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.410> clear<00:02:59.769> and<00:02:59.920> doesn't<00:03:00.220> have

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410

have a chance to it here but the hole is
still<00:03:54.730> there<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.019> we'll<00:03:56.200> go<00:03:56.320> back<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.890> we'll

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
still there so we'll go back and we'll

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.790 
still there so we'll go back and we'll
redo<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:58.049> that's<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.320> problem<00:03:59.709> at<00:04:00.040> all

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
redo that that's not a problem at all

redo that that's not a problem at all
I<00:04:01.890> could<00:04:02.550> do<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> different<00:04:02.970> color<00:04:03.360> absolutely

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250

let's try to keep that whole toll and
neat<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.709> clean<00:04:17.420> that<00:04:18.420> since<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.799> don't<00:04:19.950> have

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
neat and clean that since you don't have

any other color online what I'm going to
do<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.640> be<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.790> little<00:04:24.030> bit<00:04:24.120> more<00:04:24.300> careful<00:04:24.750> this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
do is be a little bit more careful this

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:34.040 
do is be a little bit more careful this
time<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.730> give<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> chance<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.540> fill<00:04:33.810> in

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
time and give that a chance to fill in

no that one isn't actually because
they're<00:05:05.850> sometimes<00:05:06.200> they're<00:05:07.200> small<00:05:07.850> but<00:05:08.850> this

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
they're sometimes they're small but this

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.100 
they're sometimes they're small but this
is<00:05:09.180> really<00:05:09.480> for<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:11.570> person<00:05:12.570> that's<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.930> little

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
is really for the person that's a little

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.150 
is really for the person that's a little
bit<00:05:13.260> more<00:05:13.580> detail-oriented<00:05:15.350> or<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.410> little<00:05:16.680> emo

bit more detail-oriented or a little emo

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.760

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
stay well that will have to fix it fix

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.370 
stay well that will have to fix it fix
that<00:05:23.300> but<00:05:24.300> it's<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:24.600> reason<00:05:24.990> why<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.200> won't

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
that but it's the reason why it won't

that but it's the reason why it won't
today<00:05:25.740> you're<00:05:26.060> probably<00:05:27.060> just<00:05:27.600> needs<00:05:27.900> a

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
today you're probably just needs a

today you're probably just needs a

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
little more finessing maybe there's not
