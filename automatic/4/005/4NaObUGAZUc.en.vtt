00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.830
 because we always say that when we focus our attention 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 on the development of our team 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 the single player of our whole 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.270
 clubs would then lie even if we are 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 Doing good work will make the results 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.380
 and comes with THE RESULTS then 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 of course, of course 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 table space we are happy that's yes 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 no question that it works like that and nobody 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.580
 will slow down a development here 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.130
 but I warn against overemphasizing 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.990
 we have really good ones 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.450
 never had it in shape before 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.950
 was in our club and we are doing it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.330
 now just turn it on already 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 country break to use 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.460
 continue to work very concentrated and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 to continuously develop ourselves 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.390
 We are not finished with ours yet 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 Development of the is a process of the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 seventh game day will not be over 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 can and is part of this process 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.560
 will eventually setbacks 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.560
 that is in the nature of the matter 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 in relation to the new arrivals one can 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 Of course, it is nice to say 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 Of course, many thoughts also do 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 plans forges how could grab something 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.100
 and then you see that in a relatively short time 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.510
 time the characters full in character 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 the group integrated see that the 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.710
 Team a great deal 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 cared for each other and that too 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.580
 in the square the things are recognizable 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.530
 we saw 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.869
 but it will be so it is like that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 in a group of over 20 and over 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 that's a federal league squad 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 Not everyone can always structure 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.710
 but start right now 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.560
 developments as we now at 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 barrick - you have to say it's worth it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 if the players give time 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.200
 you can see that they work hard on themselves 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.420
 want to develop 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 I think has a great comparison 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.619
 he recently brought with him 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.720
 a ketchup bottle compared to the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 you always knock and shake and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
 wobbles and eventually comes everything 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 all at once and so it is now in the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.790
 Last season no goal scored now 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.260
 he already tells his fifth 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.050
 duty game goal in the cup he has 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.820
 hit four times in the league so is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 a great development and for the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.540
 day pleased me immensely think of the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.380
 city ​​has been in the past 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.660
 back round a great development 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.130
 gone through and crazy player the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.470
 due to its technically tactical 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.530
 skills always for several 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.579
 positions without problems planned 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.709
 he could have been in the last few years 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.079
 Play part played on the ten 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.680
 then on outward position in the 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.060
 midfield 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.620
 Actually, that's central 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.329
 Midfielder and currently he plays 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.590
 just with us the situation knows so 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.700
 Gives up the constellation in the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.959
 team on the right 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.810
 outside linebacker position 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.170
 and you just have to say that he does that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.170
 Excellent good 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.860
 when I hear someone calling us 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 supposed top team 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.100
 I would like to designate then 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.510
 Smile something because we have never 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.250
 a better place than the seventh 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.640
 one reaches a top team one is 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.710
 someday when going on for years in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.220
 Upper third of the football Bundesliga 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.230
 can play and I think they see 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.000
 although after that are currently very far 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.170
 I can say that we removed 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.790
 at some point about table places in the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.380
 May of the next year 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.510
 then I am ready to announce here 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.020
 to carry me to a statement 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.000
 to let 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.770
 now I'm going to beat ours 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.790
 Do not leave neither inside 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.350
 still outward 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.850
 I'll say it again we want us 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.120
 We define content-related goals 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.320
 have a very ambitious troupe 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.850
 hungry trainers team that's clear 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.590
 and we all want the best possible 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.720
 But I think it has already been achieved 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 a thousand times the mistake made on the seventh 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.010
 spieltag anything back to close 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.480
 Maybe on the last day of the game or 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.060
 to be blinded by any 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.840
 table situation we want the error 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 not do 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.040
 we know what's behind it we know 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.200
 that the current situation for us 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.150
 we are very happy 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.739
 but want to continue working and hope 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.739
 then tie us over this way
