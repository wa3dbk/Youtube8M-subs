right there if you saw the last video
there<00:04:02.940> was<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> crack<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:05.550> skin<00:04:05.940> was<00:04:06.210> cracked

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
there was a crack the skin was cracked

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.260 
there was a crack the skin was cracked
right<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.550> between<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.390> knuckle<00:04:10.050> and

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
right there in between the knuckle and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.810 
right there in between the knuckle and
the<00:04:12.270> nail<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:13.910> here<00:04:14.910> it's<00:04:15.480> all<00:04:15.750> healed<00:04:16.140> up<00:04:16.820> but

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the nail and here it's all healed up but

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.480 
the nail and here it's all healed up but
I<00:04:18.180> i<00:04:18.859> really<00:04:19.859> think<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.520> nail<00:04:20.820> is

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
I i really think that that nail is

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.510 
I i really think that that nail is
kind<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.699> goner<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:25.080> figured<00:04:25.860> since<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:26.310> was

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
kind of a goner I figured since I was

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.820 
kind of a goner I figured since I was
since<00:04:26.939> I<00:04:27.120> was<00:04:27.330> clipping<00:04:27.599> our<00:04:28.169> since<00:04:28.439> I<00:04:28.620> was

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
since I was clipping our since I was

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.320 
since I was clipping our since I was
checking<00:04:29.669> out<00:04:29.879> my<00:04:30.090> toes<00:04:31.069> than<00:04:32.069> I<00:04:32.159> would<00:04:32.400> check

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
checking out my toes than I would check

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.740 
checking out my toes than I would check
out<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.960> would<00:04:34.590> clip<00:04:34.830> my<00:04:34.979> toenails<00:04:35.300> at<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.509> same

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
out I would clip my toenails at the same

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.129 
out I would clip my toenails at the same
time<00:04:37.699> sorry<00:04:38.699> my<00:04:38.939> hand<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.419> in<00:04:39.599> the<00:04:39.629> way<00:04:39.750> here

clipping<00:05:35.190> my<00:05:35.580> toenails<00:05:41.360> like<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.389> said<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:43.409> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
clipping my toenails like I said the the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.589 
clipping my toenails like I said the the
big<00:05:46.080> toe<00:05:46.379> you<00:05:46.979> see<00:05:47.219> how<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.580> moves<00:05:47.879> right<00:05:48.300> there

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
big toe you see how it moves right there

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.959 
big toe you see how it moves right there
how<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.020> nail<00:05:49.469> moves<00:05:49.889> that's<00:05:50.460> not<00:05:50.940> good

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
how the nail moves that's not good

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.450 
how the nail moves that's not good
that's<00:05:52.069> not<00:05:53.069> good<00:05:53.219> at<00:05:53.639> all<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.889> think<00:05:55.889> I'm

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
that's not good at all so I think I'm

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.430 
that's not good at all so I think I'm
just<00:05:56.819> checking<00:05:57.120> my<00:05:57.360> nails<00:05:57.690> here<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.080> make<00:05:58.229> sure

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
just checking my nails here to make sure

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.320 
just checking my nails here to make sure
that<00:05:58.589> they're<00:05:58.830> pretty<00:05:59.490> short<00:05:59.819> they're<00:06:00.120> all

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
that they're pretty short they're all

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.680 
that they're pretty short they're all
pretty<00:06:00.539> short<00:06:00.870> so<00:06:02.000> with<00:06:03.000> that<00:06:03.120> nail<00:06:03.389> being

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
pretty short so with that nail being

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.110 
pretty short so with that nail being
loose<00:06:04.050> like<00:06:04.469> that<00:06:04.849> then<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:08.370> doctor<00:06:08.849> is

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
loose like that then the doctor is

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.369 
loose like that then the doctor is
probably<00:06:09.539> going<00:06:09.719> to<00:06:09.839> take<00:06:10.110> off<00:06:10.349> that<00:06:10.680> nail

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379 
probably going to take off that nail

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.050 
probably going to take off that nail
because<00:06:13.379> it's<00:06:13.770> not<00:06:13.919> really<00:06:14.250> attached<00:06:14.610> too

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
because it's not really attached too

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.110 
because it's not really attached too
much<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.629> anything<00:06:16.279> I<00:06:18.409> feel<00:06:19.409> like<00:06:19.589> though<00:06:20.120> the

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
much to anything I feel like though the

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.709 
much to anything I feel like though the
