not<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:38.040> something<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.450> featured<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
not really something that is featured in

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
not really something that is featured in
this<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.129> he<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.520> uses<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> melee

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this game so he just uses the melee

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.700 
this game so he just uses the melee
attack<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.960> he'll<00:00:43.140> hit<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
attack so like he'll hit you with the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
attack so like he'll hit you with the
butt<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> gun<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> he<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.719> fire<00:00:45.930> any

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
butt of the gun and he doesn't fire any

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.190 
butt of the gun and he doesn't fire any
weapons<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.520> doesn't<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.059> explosives<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
weapons he doesn't use any explosives it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.220 
weapons he doesn't use any explosives it
is<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.980> melee<00:00:50.520> attacks<00:00:50.969> only<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.870> think

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
is all melee attacks only and I think

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.459 
is all melee attacks only and I think
that<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.190> makes<00:00:53.520> him<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.809> unique<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that is what makes him so unique and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
that is what makes him so unique and
just<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.920> cool<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> watch<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.690> I'm

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
I guess that's sometimes a bit of a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.300 
I guess that's sometimes a bit of a
downfall<00:02:23.230> because<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.680> don't<00:02:23.890> really<00:02:24.010> learn

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
