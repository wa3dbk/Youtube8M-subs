00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.340
 guys doing test, debate on the sound 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.130
 the other 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
 Saturn 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 My God of heaven that's me just now 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.550
 full of fuso and three for war and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.340
 help hold your child hold on here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.489
 3rd game all but when it showed just 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.060
 the configuration for the team is already 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.190
 turning the reverse is giving here t4f of that nÃ© 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.420
 plays guitar 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:13.979
 included size 50 60 and 70 recording 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 your study playing for the club 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.009
 same day milk 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.280
 the Catholics 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.470
 Just to be here, here I go. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.370
 call now is on the attack 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.370
 we are 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:48.910
 it is the setting that the band 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.400
 galley there all in ultra ultra ultra 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.060
 problem was a milestone at most 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.410
 Resolution valley here O was more than 140% 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.369
 I was able to go to record 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.380
 right at the most 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.800
 I think it 's a beta tour this is the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 Basque can get to play 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.020
 without recording are about 50 60 fps 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.670
 sometimes even page depending on the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.670
 departure up to 80 90 feet 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
 our memory and a tank agreement 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.050
 the face there 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 now 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 if I run away from here it 's the new lima tank 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 In these 100 thousand taxis I think it's 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.470
 crazy he back there is already there 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:03.260
 When did you hit that fps? 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.260
 recording with artyom 60fps then it's medium 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 complicated 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:19.520
 no one has anyone watching from the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.520
 that you put the sea 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.800
 there were two bars 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:08.379
 The ball job he's going to talk 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.299
 part of the bag 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.770
 but until turning well I 'm going to fall 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:45.020
 underneath just not to die alright 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:51.139
 the money passed through my space and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.360
 happened from r that's it, guys, just ghost 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.370
 even to see when you do not have 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.949
 held here 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.389
 I would like to disagree lac and thanks 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.389
 I've stopped recording
