00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.859
 getafe video with line up and jake for 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.509
 that when a little race at the same time 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.680
 commented this video and well then I here 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.179
 playing a pretty cool race of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.070
 see what looks good is called without 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 stop jumping something like that and it's technical 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.049
 a few guiris that are not 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.700
 subscribers are people who have 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.080
 found randomly by the game 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.430
 so good by how do we say we're 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.279
 here watching the race in which what 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 not comment something very important and apart 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 of being very important is also something 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 pretty sad we could qualify it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 why then because I look I'm going to the point 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
 it turns out that the gta 5 good rockstar 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 each announcing good I've had to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.219
 edit from behind although it sounds bad 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 the case seems that rockstar just 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.250
 announce on their official page that the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.899
 leave is just the link below 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 in the description they can just 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 announce on your official page that in gta 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 5 online will stop working in the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 future in the new attribution 1.17 that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 where you already know that previously 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 got the 1.16 the second when they put 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 the announced 1.17 of rockstar that gt5 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.219
 online will stop working for the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.050
 people that have a console goes that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.910
 can tell a celebration 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.290
 a console that is from a hard drive 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 less than 12 gb can have 200 and more than 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.490
 gigabytes of memory or 500 which is the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 mancheta da I think you can also have 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.400
 all in the console more for attack is 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.479
 the one that less digital memory then 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.970
 Well, people who have a 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.920
 12 mega console is worth only have 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.140
 memory of 12 megabytes because it is not going to 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.180
 elgeta operate five online and run 30 or 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.590
 because then very simple basically this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.369
 will spend some time hanging from a tree 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.360
 that this will happen because in hertha 5 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.560
 line you already know that you have a 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.000
 memory requirement of a game 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 quite broad and obviously 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.630
 it requires a lot of memory space and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 then all the dlc in the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.720
 They getting desperate ranging from 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.490
 associations in gt5 online this too 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 you want memory of game that happens then 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.759
 who once you put the 1 with 17 already 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.190
 all this memory will be totally 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.630
 busy is worth 12 gigs per game and 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.979
 everything that is in their gestation 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.970
 with line then then the people who 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.380
 have this is more than claudio use more than 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.210
 less than 12 appointments in your console because no 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.039
 will be able to play online 5 card that passes 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.659
 I searched for google italy lookout 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.520
 you can expand what comes next 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.960
 hard disk of the console exist and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.610
 for example an epic console is already a 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.229
 precision 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.520
 I've searched by google if you can 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.229
 expand what the hard drive should be 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.880
 buying a new hard drive baratillo 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.259
 something like that to be able to put the new 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 update and continue playing now 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.170
 that if you do not have the new performances 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.060
 downloaded, you will not be able to play 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.860
 to online mode or in gta no games already 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.990
 just having to have forgiveness that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.970
 have the latest updates 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.260
 always downloaded to play at 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.730
 online of any game there will be some 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.290
 No, but almost everyone always has 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.430
 to do the last application then 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.320
 Well, as I say, you are informing me 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.640
 to see you can do something and really 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.320
 seen that yes you can do something 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.060
 really if you have a 12gb console 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.640
 I recommend that you already put in 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 contact with someone is worth something with 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.670
 sony support with microsoft support 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.140
 some videogames store and 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.120
 comment your case it's worth that we're going 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.680
 to stop working 5 online and 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.600
 you want to keep playing and you can 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 buy a new hard drive something or some 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.750
 theme of these then good to put in 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 contact them through the number and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.860
 so and so they explain how 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.030
 is the subject and you can do something like that with 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.170
 guys here I need the controls 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.550
 end of the race because I wanted to see in 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.230
 What position did I have left? 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.280
 second and the whole pint because it 's that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 I have the drink, we do not want to be 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.580
 I can lift ' really makes a boy 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 as libya basically everything can already 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 leave an expert if you liked 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.220
 and as I say a pretty sad news 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.540
 but that had many people help the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.160
 topic on how to expand your 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 disputes and you have a console of less 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.430
 12 gb so nothing else here I end up like 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.110
 you are seeing is that I have done 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 missing the race from that and as 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.500
 I say you already know the success will be presented if 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 the three of us and we're going to them bye bye
