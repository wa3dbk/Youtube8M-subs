00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
much as we could and I thought it would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.660 
much as we could and I thought it would
be<00:02:07.609> a<00:02:07.639> great<00:02:07.909> idea<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.569> encourage<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
be a great idea to encourage the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.950 
be a great idea to encourage the
children<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.210> neighborhood<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.780> come

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
children of the neighborhood to come

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.720 
children of the neighborhood to come
over<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.290> Holy<00:02:12.470> Spirit

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
over the Holy Spirit

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.130 
over the Holy Spirit
so<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.120> could<00:02:14.300> become<00:02:14.569> acquainted<00:02:15.080> with

so that we could become acquainted with

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.199 
so that we could become acquainted with
them<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.530> their<00:02:15.620> families<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:16.940> be<00:02:17.030> one

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
them and their families it would be one

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.119 
them and their families it would be one
step<00:02:17.390> further<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> direction<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.799> trying

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
step further in the direction of trying

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.550

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
together in the same parking lot they

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.659 
together in the same parking lot they
might<00:03:35.540> not<00:03:35.690> have<00:03:35.840> necessarily<00:03:36.109> been<00:03:36.739> playing

might not have necessarily been playing

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.849 
might not have necessarily been playing
together<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.599> same<00:03:38.810> street<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.709> they

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
together on the same street if they

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.319 
together on the same street if they
weren't<00:03:40.099> there<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.669> they've<00:03:40.790> all<00:03:40.970> kind<00:03:41.239> of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
weren't there and they've all kind of

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.569 
weren't there and they've all kind of
come<00:03:41.870> together<00:03:42.109> for<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> same<00:03:42.919> reason<00:03:42.950> to

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
come together for the same reason to

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.360 
come together for the same reason to
come<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.599> fun<00:03:44.959> in<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.560> church<00:03:46.340> parking

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
come and have fun in the church parking

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.089 
come and have fun in the church parking
lot<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.180> think<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.919> expands<00:03:48.919> the

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
lot and I think it just expands the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.729 
lot and I think it just expands the
meaning<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.760> word<00:03:49.970> church<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.349> I<00:03:51.500> think

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
meaning of the word church and I think

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.949 
meaning of the word church and I think
it<00:03:51.889> just<00:03:52.160> means<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.150> place<00:03:53.299> just<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.780> come

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
it just means a place just to come

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.400 
it just means a place just to come
together<00:03:54.139> and<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.370> share<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> common<00:03:56.750> love<00:03:56.780> for

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
together and and share a common love for

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:40.010 
together and and share a common love for
something<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.639> case<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:59.329> bicycle

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 

you
