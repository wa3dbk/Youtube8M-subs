00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
to pull off but when it does it can be

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.589 
to pull off but when it does it can be
really<00:02:55.129> hurtful<00:02:55.730> for<00:02:55.849> your<00:02:56.090> opponent<00:02:56.239> we're

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
a not trying to be racist but we asked

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.180 
a not trying to be racist but we asked
one<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:20.989> our<00:03:21.169> ate<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.319> couple<00:03:21.620> asian<00:03:21.769> friends

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
one of our ate a couple asian friends

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.430 
one of our ate a couple asian friends
and<00:03:22.370> Jing<00:03:22.760> Jing<00:03:23.090> qu<00:03:23.389> means<00:03:23.930> absolutely

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
and Jing Jing qu means absolutely

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.080 
and Jing Jing qu means absolutely
nothing<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.979> just<00:03:25.010> gibberish<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.699> just<00:03:25.909> made

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
nothing it's just gibberish is just made

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
nothing it's just gibberish is just made
up<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.540> we<00:03:27.409> thought<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.799> meant<00:03:27.919> like<00:03:28.129> care

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
up so we thought it meant like care

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.699 
up so we thought it meant like care
package<00:03:28.849> or<00:03:29.000> something<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.329> don't<00:03:29.389> know<00:03:29.709> anyway

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
package or something I don't know anyway

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.069 
package or something I don't know anyway
so<00:03:31.189> the<00:03:31.669> idea<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.939> this<00:03:32.090> card<00:03:32.359> is<00:03:32.479> it's<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:32.989> a

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
so the idea of this card is it's it's a

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.809 
so the idea of this card is it's it's a
regular<00:03:33.229> trap<00:03:33.560> card<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:33.979> continuous<00:03:34.639> though

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
regular trap card it's continuous though

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.140 
regular trap card it's continuous though
so<00:03:35.060> keep<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.449> mind<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:37.790> when<00:03:38.060> you

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
so keep that in mind so you when you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.969 
so keep that in mind so you when you
activate<00:03:38.479> this<00:03:38.599> card<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.470> usually<00:03:39.590> want<00:03:39.859> to

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
activate this card you usually want to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.140 
activate this card you usually want to
activate<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.370> during<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.729> end<00:03:40.849> phase<00:03:40.909> your

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
activate it during the end phase your

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.449 
activate it during the end phase your
opponent's<00:03:41.540> turn<00:03:41.629> what<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.959> does<00:03:42.169> is<00:03:42.439> it<00:03:42.769> it

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
opponent's turn what it does is it it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.789 
opponent's turn what it does is it it
prevents<00:03:44.209> your<00:03:44.329> opponent<00:03:44.870> from<00:03:45.109> activating

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
prevents your opponent from activating

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.179 
prevents your opponent from activating

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.450 
your ear i think they're pretty much
dead<00:06:23.690> honestly<00:06:24.229> you<00:06:24.800> can<00:06:24.919> use<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.190> against

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
dead honestly you can use it against

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.640 
dead honestly you can use it against
black<00:06:25.729> wings<00:06:26.060> i<00:06:26.240> guess<00:06:26.479> against<00:06:27.260> their<00:06:27.409> curse

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
black wings i guess against their curse

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.230 
black wings i guess against their curse
attacks<00:06:27.949> if<00:06:28.159> they<00:06:28.250> don't<00:06:28.430> change<00:06:28.610> it<00:06:28.820> if<00:06:28.909> this

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
attacks if they don't change it if this

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.149 
attacks if they don't change it if this
like<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:29.599> only<00:06:29.690> card<00:06:29.960> java<00:06:30.169> on<00:06:30.349> your<00:06:30.470> field<00:06:30.710> or

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
like the only card java on your field or

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.000 
like the only card java on your field or
if<00:06:31.580> they<00:06:31.729> just<00:06:31.760> set<00:06:32.389> it<00:06:32.419> so<00:06:33.380> that's<00:06:33.830> pretty

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
if they just set it so that's pretty

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.649 
if they just set it so that's pretty
much<00:06:34.159> it<00:06:34.340> these<00:06:34.820> cards<00:06:35.090> are<00:06:35.210> both<00:06:35.419> really

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
much it these cards are both really

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:38.110 
much it these cards are both really
amazing<00:06:36.080> this<00:06:36.260> really<00:06:36.770> stops<00:06:37.460> a<00:06:37.729> bunch<00:06:37.969> of

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
amazing this really stops a bunch of

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.140 
amazing this really stops a bunch of
your<00:06:38.360> opponent's<00:06:38.719> set

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
your opponent's set

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.570 
your opponent's set
this<00:06:39.660> can<00:06:39.960> just<00:06:40.200> slow<00:06:40.500> roll<00:06:40.770> them<00:06:41.010> and<00:06:41.280> really

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
this can just slow roll them and really

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.880 
this can just slow roll them and really
prevent<00:06:42.450> them<00:06:42.630> from<00:06:42.660> going<00:06:42.990> off<00:06:43.290> like<00:06:43.740> if

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
prevent them from going off like if

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.200 
prevent them from going off like if
they're<00:06:44.010> doing<00:06:44.190> cold<00:06:44.430> wave<00:06:44.580> sorry<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:45.060> thing
