00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.169
 I'm going to let it boil and the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.720
 third milled that I'm going to make is the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.110

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.750
 what was the seeds of the bobbin and the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.600

 to the plum paste remove the bone 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.500
 it's already boiling now I'm going to add 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.510
 this 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.460
 if you see how from this manga site 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.280
 I already added him here 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.090
 all the ingredients that pre and those that 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.669
 the last thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.889
 season with salt and add the 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.680
 piloncillo and chocolate but while 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.400
 I'm going to let it season with fire 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.860
 low for one hour 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.020
 without stopping moving him so he does not 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.169
 hit or you start deep here 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.610
 for an hour 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.610
 Now what I'm going to do is 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.430
 add the chocolate and the piloncillo and 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.870
 let it season for another 20 minutes in 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:12.560
 what breaks down the piloncillo 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:16.120
 and chocolate now finally 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.120
 I'm going to add salt 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.470
 I will verify 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.470
 that already the taste 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.180
 and this one that no longer needs salt 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.190
 and that's fine, I will not leave 5 minutes 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.310
 I'm going to turn it off and that's how it has 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.350
