think<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.940> good<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.650> then<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.010> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
think we were good and then it was a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
think we were good and then it was a
very<00:01:32.550> little<00:01:32.940> time<00:01:33.120> to<00:01:33.390> prepare<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> looks

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
very little time to prepare but it looks

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.500 
very little time to prepare but it looks
like<00:01:34.380> he<00:01:34.620> didn't<00:01:34.980> affect<00:01:35.940> me<00:01:36.090> too<00:01:36.120> much<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
like he didn't affect me too much so

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.750 
like he didn't affect me too much so
maybe<00:01:36.720> next<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.920> need<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.160> rush<00:01:38.340> myself

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760
