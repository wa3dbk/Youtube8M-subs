00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello we are in the company of the battery 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:19.119
 original external samsung backup from 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:23.260
 9 thousand milan because it is a product that 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:27.519
 samsung has designed for smartphones and 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:31.449
 tablet in fact internet of the condition 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:35.470
 we find both a micro usb cable aunts 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.120
 a 30-pin dock cable for your galaxy 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.989
 tab 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:46.360
 this is the packaging I must not say that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:49.089
 what do you know we find children on 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.540
 battery and 2000 in the green here it is 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:58.659
 here is in the palm of a hand and small 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.260
 and relatively light compared to 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.600
 products of great capacity the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.159
 let's see what we see in a moment 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.880
 protection still continues a 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:18.120
 manual also in Italian 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:19.600
 two short cables very short the 30 mini e 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.870
 micro usb 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 here it is for smartphone charging 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.690
 of course it is a product at the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.620
 universal compatibility 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.920
 the important thing is that you use the cables 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.450
 more appropriate and of course 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:45.270
 also compatible with iphone ipad i 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.930
 htc lg ok how the product is made 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 this shows the frontally by a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.450
 protective film 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.910
 we have four status indicators 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.890
 land on the right side a large one 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.470
 on off switch 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 here is the design as you see a lot 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:17.450
 Spartan but a modern all white 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:22.770
 ok at the top the usb output e 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.620
 the input for micro usb charging 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.650
 nothing on the left side on the bottom 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.020
 flat and a battery from where I got it 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.380
 milian for an energy reserve from 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.640
 take with you when you are out you don't 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.320
 has the ability to recharge the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.360
 own device is to be considered that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.700
 recharge times depend on which one 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.270
 power supply we use the samp not 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.830
 strongly recommends using 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.860
 the power supply for 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.540
 10 watts for new wave 10 watt notes 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.990
 much to have with literature and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 said this battery takes about six 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.430
 hours to fully recharge your seat 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.050
 judicial 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.820
 the classic all la7 surf power supply 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.050
 a nice employee from 12 to 16 hours 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 we are even linked in 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.330
 USB port takes from 18 to 22 hours 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.310
 in short, therefore, a life and advice 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.510
 use a 10 watt power supply 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 which is not provided in the package 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.010
 when he complains about the entry of a test 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.450
 shows LEDs that only that of 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.230
 red color were greener 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.260
 because in kabul that is in charge 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.269
 as the LEDs light up 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.200
 the charge time each led corresponds 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.780
 to a 25 percent recharge then if 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.519
 there is only one access bed the charge that 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.769
 the charge from zero to 25 percent 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.569
 residual if less than 5 percent 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.090
 widen yours there is an access lounge 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.379
 flashing with thriller and turned on 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.890
 we will have a 50 to 75 percent charge 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:20.840
 ok use of course a lot 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:24.190
 simple short trivial when she 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.190
 smart when you are about to unleash 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.050
 let's take his cable made in 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.750
 battery 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:39.680
 let's play the drums like that 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.780
 initially the two LEDs light up 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.120
 indicate precisely 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:50.380
 what is the state of charge and then yes 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.380
 turn off ok and then 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.010
 we connect to the smartphone that goes into 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.120
 charge 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.300
 the operation can also be followed 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.960
 as a tablet of course 9000 emilian 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.910
 for they may not always be in 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.590
 able to charge all the batteries 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.420
 completely above all here some 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.610
 big tablet battles though 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.560
 certainly miss miss with a quality 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.550
 enough to keep working 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.550
 still for several hours
