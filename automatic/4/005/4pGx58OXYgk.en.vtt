 have on a shelf the mice or 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 animals in your brand is worth I could you 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.460
 a ledge here we have the lord 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 patogallina who is greeting us from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 cow lady that here looks very funny 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 in the high blocks and here I have been 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.260
 escaped two mobs the clipper and the place 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.059
 I was on a break or they said to the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.399
 Well, the video will start 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 for ass this is going 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 Here I will show you how to do this 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 wonderful invention what they are going to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.920
 need is the following is worth here 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 I already have going to need stone slabs 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 OK 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.160
 stairs are going to need torches from 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 reddish stone pistons not not sticky is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.330
 important crystal and the booster is worth 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 from there and everything 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 of the mods that you want 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 fossilize first let's make our 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.830
 platform that is two by two blocks 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 It's worth 2 for 2 that will be this way for stairs 2 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.800
 by 2 and that there is a hole in the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 center here we're going to break a 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 staircase and let's go back for a 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.670
 slab after we are going to place two blocks 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 of balloons with the first block that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.270
 we place what we are going to remove and now 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.400
 let's count two blocks for the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 blocks four blocks up from 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 crystal one two three and four is worth in the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.729
 second let's place one to the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.260
 left and we're going to break the third 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.660
 important here we are going to place a mod 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.290
 that measures two blocks high 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.260
 example the witch because not with what 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.920
 here is we are going to place it before 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 we put everything in it and it's not going to suffocate 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.660
 because the crystal and the balloons are 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.570
 two blocks that do not allow it to 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.750
 suffocate vale here let's use what 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.700
 is here the torches we are going to place 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.190
 the piston looking down here 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.560
 right here and we are going to place a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 reddish brown night and as you see it goes 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.380
 to activate and the witch is trapped 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.540
 now yes since we remove this and we can 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.880
 replace this by stairs so that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.670
 it stays that way and as you see here, its 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.010
 bus hat because it 's a little higher 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
 of two blocks but you can try it with 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.239
 another way here if you want to try it with 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.970
 the lenderman would be the same 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.120
 procedure is worth two blocks two 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.920
 blocks to see if we repeat what was left 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 in the center we break this we put it 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.380
 for a slab we put two of close ton 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.900
 we break the one below and here we go to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.390
 place five glass blocks worth and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.270
 five since the letterman 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.600
 it measures 3 1 2 and 3 is worth 4 and 5 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.830
 let's break if the fourth and now 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.800
 we are going to place one in the third one 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.550
 more crystal block like we're going to 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.459
 place now the lenderman here what 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.250
 we place and here it is and now we put the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.530
 piston again looking down and what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.470
 we activate with the torch by steve 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.420
 wallace is already our brother trapped 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.900
 The best thing about this trick is that in the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.840
 under mans you can not escape worth not 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 you can teleport or anything 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.720
 the man intern although the one of the eyes 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.310
 the eyes more of dolls have you look 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.549
 economy up it seems that you are 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.519
 customizing something but here in 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.870
 lenderman can not escape good 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.860

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.030
