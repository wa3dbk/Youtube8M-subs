and now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> ink<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.700> what<00:02:05.700> you're

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
going to put the ink on what you're

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.800 
going to put the ink on what you're
going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.069> blob<00:02:08.069> printing<00:02:08.670> ink<00:02:08.970> it's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
going to use is a blob printing ink it's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
going to use is a blob printing ink it's
a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.410> elastic<00:02:10.979> than<00:02:11.160> regular

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
a little bit more elastic than regular

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.130 
a little bit more elastic than regular
ink<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.120> it'll<00:02:12.330> stick<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.810> design

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
ink and it'll stick to your design

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.130 
ink and it'll stick to your design
better<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.510> get<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:15.810> most<00:02:15.959> craft

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
better and you can get it at most craft

water-based block printing ink you want

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.559 
water-based block printing ink you want
to<00:02:41.250> stick<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.489> water-based<00:02:42.030> products<00:02:42.420> when

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
to stick to water-based products when

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.870 
to stick to water-based products when
you're<00:02:42.690> working<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:42.989> kids<00:02:44.390> okay<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.880> then

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
don't worry about getting it all of it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.830 
don't worry about getting it all of it
place<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:02.670> keep<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.150> till<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.660> it

where you like it it's fun to have it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.849 
where you like it it's fun to have it
kind<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.750> different<00:03:07.049> colors<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.440> there<00:03:07.620> too<00:03:07.769> it

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
kind of different colors in there too it

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.830 
kind of different colors in there too it
doesn't<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.459> super<00:03:08.609> even<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.630> just

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
doesn't have to be super even you just

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.690 
doesn't have to be super even you just
want<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.079> make<00:03:10.230> sure<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.650> not<00:03:10.799> too<00:03:11.040> thick<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
want to make sure it's not too thick and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.650 
want to make sure it's not too thick and
globby<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:13.470> it'll<00:03:13.790> be<00:03:14.790> difficult<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.299> make<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
globby or it'll be difficult to make the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.520 
globby or it'll be difficult to make the
print<00:03:17.180> okay<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> we're<00:03:21.870> going<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> take<00:03:22.290> our

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
print okay so we're going to take our

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.809 
print okay so we're going to take our
design<00:03:23.600> hold<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.720> little<00:03:24.959> section<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.819> and

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
design hold a little section of it and

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.520 
design hold a little section of it and
we're<00:03:27.090> going<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.269> go<00:03:27.359> ahead<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.750> ink<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.109> up

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.509 

and<00:03:31.530> we're<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.859> go<00:03:32.040> different

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
and we're going to go different

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.979 
and we're going to go different
directions<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> make<00:03:33.389> sure<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:33.900> get

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
directions to make sure we get

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:43.780 
directions to make sure we get
everything<00:03:35.720> really<00:03:36.720> well<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.680> evenly

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.340 

okay<00:03:45.170> that's<00:03:46.170> good<00:03:47.780> now<00:03:48.780> what<00:03:49.079> we're<00:03:49.200> going<00:03:49.319> to

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
okay that's good now what we're going to

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.930 
okay that's good now what we're going to
put<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.370> use<00:03:50.489> any<00:03:50.639> kind<00:03:50.819> of

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
put it on is you can use any kind of

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.640 
put it on is you can use any kind of
paper<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.359> have<00:03:51.510> at<00:03:51.630> home<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.049> like<00:03:52.200> using<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
paper you have at home I like using a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.740 
paper you have at home I like using a
thick<00:03:52.859> cardstock<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.540> I'm<00:03:54.630> going

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
thick cardstock this is what I'm going

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.150 
thick cardstock this is what I'm going
to<00:03:54.780> use<00:03:54.930> today<00:03:55.139> but<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.560> doesn't<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.069> be

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
to use today but it doesn't have to be

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.979 
to use today but it doesn't have to be
anything<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.579> particular<00:03:56.730> nothing<00:03:57.630> expensive

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
anything in particular nothing expensive

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.059 
anything in particular nothing expensive
or<00:03:59.060> just<00:04:00.060> use<00:04:00.269> what<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.980> that's<00:04:01.980> the

or just use what you have that's the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.580 
or just use what you have that's the
whole<00:04:02.250> point<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:03.630> fun<00:04:03.959> stuff<00:04:03.989> with<00:04:04.440> what

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
whole point is to do fun stuff with what

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
whole point is to do fun stuff with what
you<00:04:04.680> already<00:04:04.859> have<00:04:05.190> hopefully<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.900> find<00:04:07.109> the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you already have hopefully so find the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.449 
you already have hopefully so find the
best<00:04:07.440> side<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.849> paper<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.540> you're<00:04:09.810> using

best side of the paper that you're using

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.990 
best side of the paper that you're using
and<00:04:11.459> that's<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.909> side<00:04:12.120> we're<00:04:12.390> going<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.540> press
