00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
access to the drive that could be even

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
access to the drive that could be even
just<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.879> single<00:00:48.210> folder<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> drive<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.230> will

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
just a single folder on the drive I will

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
just a single folder on the drive I will
also<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> access<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> public<00:00:51.239> areas

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
as well so if you don't want them to see
it<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.570> suggest<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.199> go

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
over and turn that public access off and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
over and turn that public access off and
then<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.469> set<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> individual<00:00:59.730> user

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
then you can set up individual user

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
then you can set up individual user
rights<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.050> example<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.559> test

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
course is add a user and we'll just call

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
course is add a user and we'll just call
this<00:01:31.259> test<00:01:31.320> user<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.549> we'll<00:01:32.790> give<00:01:32.939> them<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
this test user and we'll give them a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.960 
this test user and we'll give them a
fake<00:01:33.329> email<00:01:33.689> address<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.250> set<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.820> a

fake email address here and set up a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
fake email address here and set up a
password<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.320> happen<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.799> when

validate them because Western Digital
this<00:01:45.180> might<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:45.570> issue<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.170> people

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this might be an issue for some people

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.749 
this might be an issue for some people
because<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.520> some

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
because you know there's some

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
because you know there's some
intermediary<00:01:48.299> stuff<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.170> a

Western Digital is going to kind of
manage<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.229> access<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:52.860> they're<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
manage that access so they're going to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.219 
manage that access so they're going to
send<00:01:53.729> Western<00:01:54.180> Digital<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.810> hard<00:01:55.020> drive

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
validate them as a user and the reason

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
validate them as a user and the reason
is<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> they<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> act<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
is is that they kind of act as a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
is is that they kind of act as a
clearinghouse<00:02:01.320> between<00:02:01.979> these<00:02:02.520> drives<00:02:02.909> and

the person that wants to access them
remotely<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.509> cloud<00:02:06.930> feature

remotely if you have this cloud feature
turned<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:08.069> how<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.429> works<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
turned on that's how it works so you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.760 
turned on that's how it works so you
know<00:02:09.690> internally<00:02:10.259> within<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.619> own<00:02:10.739> network

access you're going to have to give a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.820 
access you're going to have to give a

little bit of trust to Western Digital
in<00:02:21.160> order<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.670> happen<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.540> keep

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
in order for that to happen so just keep

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.940 
in order for that to happen so just keep
that<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.260> mind<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.590> well

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that in mind as well

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.830 
that in mind as well
once<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.490> user<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.910> set<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.720> they're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
once that user is set up and they're

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.150 
once that user is set up and they're
validated<00:02:26.320> themselves<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:26.890> go<00:02:26.980> over<00:02:27.100> to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
validated themselves you can go over to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
validated themselves you can go over to
cloud<00:02:27.400> access<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.230> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
cloud access and then what you can do is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.700 
cloud access and then what you can do is
click<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.520> an<00:02:30.670> individual<00:02:31.180> user<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.500> can

into<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.110> system<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.920> by<00:02:57.040> using<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.520> code

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
into the system just by using that code

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
into the system just by using that code
word<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.090> again<00:02:58.330> WD<00:02:58.840> Western<00:02:59.260> Digital<00:02:59.440> is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
word and again WD Western Digital is

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.160 
word and again WD Western Digital is
managing<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.730> transactional<00:03:01.660> process

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
managing that transactional process

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.920 
managing that transactional process
there<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:03.280> want<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:03.700> sure<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.150> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
there so you want to make sure that you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.449 
there so you want to make sure that you
know<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.110> despair<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.010> mind<00:03:06.220> there's

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
know you despair that in mind there's

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.980 
know you despair that in mind there's
always<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.090> potential<00:03:07.630> at<00:03:07.780> some

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
always you know potential at some

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.840 
always you know potential at some
government<00:03:08.560> entity<00:03:08.920> or<00:03:09.130> somebody<00:03:09.490> else<00:03:09.670> could

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
government entity or somebody else could

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.449 
government entity or somebody else could
request<00:03:10.180> access<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:11.020> data<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.370> may

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
request access to your data and you may

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.340 
request access to your data and you may
not<00:03:12.640> know<00:03:12.820> if<00:03:13.030> they<00:03:13.209> get<00:03:13.510> into<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.050> way<00:03:14.200> or

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
not know if they get into it that way or

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.630 
not know if they get into it that way or
not<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.709> would<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.130> know<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.280> again<00:03:15.610> just

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
not so I would you know just again just

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.759 
not so I would you know just again just
be<00:03:15.880> careful<00:03:16.270> with<00:03:16.420> what<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.290> want<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> give

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
be careful with what you want to give

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.140 
be careful with what you want to give
away<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.190> what<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.370> want<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.580> put<00:03:18.730> available

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
away and what you want to put available

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150 
away and what you want to put available
onto<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.570> network<00:03:19.750> now<00:03:20.320> another<00:03:20.620> thing<00:03:20.890> here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
onto the network now another thing here

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.759 
onto the network now another thing here
is<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.269> my<00:03:23.080> thing<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.380> right<00:03:23.530> now<00:03:23.560> in

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
is that the my thing is right now in

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.410 
is that the my thing is right now in
relay<00:03:24.100> connection<00:03:24.670> mode<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.180> means

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
relay connection mode and that means

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.949 
relay connection mode and that means
that<00:03:25.720> my<00:03:26.250> firewall<00:03:27.250> my<00:03:27.489> Apple<00:03:28.480> router<00:03:28.690> is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
that my firewall my Apple router is

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.440 
that my firewall my Apple router is
blocking<00:03:29.500> direct<00:03:30.280> access<00:03:30.730> from<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.030> drive<00:03:31.239> to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
blocking direct access from the drive to

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.940 
blocking direct access from the drive to
the<00:03:31.540> web<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.110> basically<00:03:32.709> being

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
the web so it's basically being

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.880 
the web so it's basically being
intermediated<00:03:33.790> through<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.300> WD<00:03:35.170> server<00:03:35.500> also

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
intermediated through a WD server also

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.410 
intermediated through a WD server also
to<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.430> me<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:36.550> that<00:03:36.700> might<00:03:36.850> slow<00:03:37.030> down<00:03:37.269> my

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
to get to me so that might slow down my

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.210 
to get to me so that might slow down my
transfer<00:03:37.840> speeds<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.170> little<00:03:38.200> bit<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.769> what<00:03:39.130> you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
transfer speeds a little bit so what you

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100 
transfer speeds a little bit so what you
can<00:03:39.400> do<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.820> use<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.540> know<00:03:40.660> your<00:03:40.840> port

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
can do is use you know your port

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.780 
can do is use you know your port
forwarding<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.620> your<00:03:41.739> router<00:03:41.950> or<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.640> don't

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
forwarding on your router or I don't

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.990 
forwarding on your router or I don't
recommend<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.299> but<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.630> could<00:03:43.870> turn<00:03:44.049> on<00:03:44.260> on

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
recommend this but you could turn on on

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.820 
recommend this but you could turn on on
UPnP<00:03:46.000> which<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> plug-and-play<00:03:46.989> or<00:03:47.530> unplug

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
UPnP which is a plug-and-play or unplug

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.009 
UPnP which is a plug-and-play or unplug
and<00:03:48.010> play<00:03:48.160> whatever<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.299> turn<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.810> on

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
and play whatever it is you turn that on

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.750 
and play whatever it is you turn that on
and<00:03:50.290> it'll<00:03:50.560> automatically<00:03:51.100> poke<00:03:51.340> holes<00:03:51.580> in

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and it'll automatically poke holes in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.490 
and it'll automatically poke holes in
your<00:03:51.850> router<00:03:52.090> but<00:03:52.360> my<00:03:52.780> suggestion<00:03:53.320> would<00:03:53.440> be

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
your router but my suggestion would be

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.560 
your router but my suggestion would be
learn<00:03:54.370> how<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.519> do<00:03:54.700> port<00:03:54.970> forwarding<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.450> your

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
learn how to do port forwarding on your

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.120 
learn how to do port forwarding on your
NAT<00:03:55.720> router<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.230> then<00:03:56.320> forward<00:03:56.680> those<00:03:56.799> ports

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
NAT router and then forward those ports

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.190 
NAT router and then forward those ports
directly<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.000> when<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> user<00:03:58.660> does<00:03:58.780> want

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
directly so that when a user does want

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.690 
directly so that when a user does want
to<00:03:59.290> connect<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.709> your<00:03:59.830> drive<00:04:00.070> they're<00:04:00.310> doing<00:04:00.580> a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
to connect to your drive they're doing a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.280 
to connect to your drive they're doing a
direct<00:04:01.209> connection<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.720> not<00:04:01.870> relaying

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
direct connection and not relaying

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.009 
direct connection and not relaying
through<00:04:02.560> WD<00:04:03.040> servers<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.540> once<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> get

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
through WD servers so but once you get

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.390 
through WD servers so but once you get
all<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.200> stuff<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.650> up<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:05.950> running<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
all that stuff it up and running and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.740 
all that stuff it up and running and
send<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.670> code<00:04:06.940> off<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.239> your<00:04:07.360> friend<00:04:07.600> they

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
send that code off to your friend they

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.870 
send that code off to your friend they
are<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.110> they<00:04:08.320> can<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.730> all

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
are in they can get in and and do all

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.160 
are in they can get in and and do all
the<00:04:10.030> things<00:04:10.239> you<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.720> them<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.930> do<00:04:11.049> and

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
the things you like for them to do and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.539 
the things you like for them to do and
the<00:04:11.260> best<00:04:11.440> part<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.799> when<00:04:11.950> they<00:04:12.070> come<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.430> your

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
the best part is when they come to your

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.370 
the best part is when they come to your
house<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.030> they're<00:04:13.120> using<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.989> drive<00:04:14.200> on

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
house and they're using the drive on

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.930 
house and they're using the drive on
your<00:04:14.410> local<00:04:14.709> network<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.340> same<00:04:15.610> username

your local network that same username

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.390 
your local network that same username
and<00:04:16.090> password<00:04:16.380> will<00:04:17.380> work<00:04:17.620> as<00:04:17.830> well<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.340> in

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and password will work as well and in

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.039 
and password will work as well and in
fact<00:04:18.580> they<00:04:18.760> throw<00:04:19.419> on<00:04:19.510> their<00:04:19.660> Mac<00:04:19.840> or<00:04:20.019> Windows

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
fact they throw on their Mac or Windows

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.110 
fact they throw on their Mac or Windows
machine<00:04:20.590> those<00:04:20.799> drives<00:04:21.100> will<00:04:21.340> show<00:04:21.970> up

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120

just<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.699> that<00:04:39.879> you're<00:04:40.000> going<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.180> be<00:04:40.330> giving

just know that you're going to be giving
a<00:04:40.780> little<00:04:41.229> bit<00:04:41.349> of<00:04:41.439> trust<00:04:41.650> 2wd<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.759> process

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
a little bit of trust 2wd in the process

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.300 
a little bit of trust 2wd in the process
but<00:04:43.479> if<00:04:44.080> you're<00:04:44.259> just<00:04:44.439> sharing<00:04:44.620> photos<00:04:44.979> and
