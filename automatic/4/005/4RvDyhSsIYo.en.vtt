presses have nylon dial dyes which are

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.500 
presses have nylon dial dyes which are
actually<00:02:45.380> help<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> prevent<00:02:46.489> scratches<00:02:52.510> so

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
actually help to prevent scratches so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.030 
actually help to prevent scratches so
place<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.320> glass<00:02:55.269> loosely<00:02:56.269> into<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.290> bezel

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
of the watch and this particular glass

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.330 
of the watch and this particular glass
has<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.090> Anamika<00:03:02.780> crest<00:03:03.079> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> centre<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:03.980> we

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
has a Anamika crest in the centre so we

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.039 
has a Anamika crest in the centre so we
want<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.609> line<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:05.920> now<00:03:06.920> we'll<00:03:08.049> using

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
want to line that up now we'll using

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.470 
want to line that up now we'll using
slightly<00:03:09.380> different<00:03:09.500> dyes<00:03:10.239> depending<00:03:11.239> on<00:03:11.359> the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
shape of the glass and the case set it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.900 
shape of the glass and the case set it
up<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.709> machine<00:03:16.040> again<00:03:16.340> use<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.579> bit<00:03:16.850> of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
up in the machine again use a bit of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.660 
up in the machine again use a bit of
plastic<00:03:17.359> so<00:03:17.660> as<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.079> prevent<00:03:18.950> scratches<00:03:19.519> on

plastic so as to prevent scratches on

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.729 
plastic so as to prevent scratches on
the<00:03:19.790> new<00:03:19.940> glass<00:03:20.299> remembering<00:03:21.140> it's<00:03:21.319> only<00:03:21.500> made

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
the new glass remembering it's only made

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.319 
the new glass remembering it's only made
of<00:03:21.859> perspex<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.420> very<00:03:23.720> easy<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.170> scratch<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.329> a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
of perspex so very easy to scratch and a

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.930 
of perspex so very easy to scratch and a
bit<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.930> tension<00:03:27.170> not<00:03:27.799> too<00:03:28.010> much<00:03:28.250> don't<00:03:28.819> want

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
bit of tension not too much don't want

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.710 
bit of tension not too much don't want
to<00:03:29.030> crack<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.420> glass<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:31.430> yet<00:03:31.609> what<00:03:31.850> else<00:03:32.120> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
to crack the glass but yet what else it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780 
to crack the glass but yet what else it
will<00:03:32.870> seat<00:03:33.109> itself<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.799> you'll<00:03:34.190> feel<00:03:34.489> a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
will seat itself and you'll feel a

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.379 
will seat itself and you'll feel a
little<00:03:35.709> almost<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.950> click<00:03:37.310> as<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.940> goes<00:03:38.150> in

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
little almost like a click as it goes in

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.729 
little almost like a click as it goes in
and<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.680> will<00:03:39.829> do<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.010> job<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.340> nicely

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
and that will do the job just nicely

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.640 
and that will do the job just nicely
these<00:03:42.739> are<00:03:42.920> water<00:03:43.190> resistant<00:03:43.790> glasses<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.930> the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
these are water resistant glasses so the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.910 
these are water resistant glasses so the
pressure<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:47.019> exerts<00:03:48.019> against<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.680> case

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
pressure that exerts against the case

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.000 
pressure that exerts against the case
due<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.850> tension<00:03:50.090> ring<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:51.560> usually

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
due to the tension ring will usually

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.340 
due to the tension ring will usually
create<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.609> watertight<00:03:53.060> seal

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.990 

so<00:04:00.350> just<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.710> quick<00:04:00.860> comparison<00:04:01.100> shot<00:04:01.760> there

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
so just a quick comparison shot there

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.870 
so just a quick comparison shot there
and<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:03.260> can<00:04:03.440> see<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.740> new<00:04:03.950> glasses<00:04:04.250> fitted

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
and you can see the new glasses fitted

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.860 
and you can see the new glasses fitted
the<00:04:05.240> old<00:04:05.420> glass<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.380> pretty<00:04:06.560> poor<00:04:06.800> state

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
the old glass is in a pretty poor state

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.480 
the old glass is in a pretty poor state
so<00:04:08.870> now<00:04:09.080> we're<00:04:09.290> ready<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.590> reassemble<00:04:10.070> the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
so now we're ready to reassemble the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:30.550 
so now we're ready to reassemble the
watch<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:29.060> thanks<00:04:29.420> for<00:04:29.540> watching<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.140> will

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
watch so thanks for watching I will

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.670 
watch so thanks for watching I will
continue<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.310> make<00:04:31.610> further<00:04:31.970> videos<00:04:32.510> on<00:04:32.870> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
continue to make further videos on the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.040 
continue to make further videos on the
various<00:04:34.040> different<00:04:34.370> types<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.940> glasses<00:04:35.600> for

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
various different types of glasses for

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.570 
various different types of glasses for
watches<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.650> how<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> fit<00:04:37.490> them<00:04:38.290> but<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:40.430> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
watches and how to fit them but in the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.360 
watches and how to fit them but in the
