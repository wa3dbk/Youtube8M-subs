00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.230
 on time 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.850
 blake usa 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.970
 Hello 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 g 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.900
 I 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.900
 I 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 Oh 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.520
 I'm ok 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.600
 you are 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.420
 clac cold and falls their 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.450
 arguing like q2 besides with 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.600
 earlier times rather tight between 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.130
 every car I miss the pole of five 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.890
 hundredths and but ultimately it's me 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.690
 who will leave in first position because 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.740
 that precisely there was a priori a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.800
 penalty that was given to mobily that's 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.420
 in 85 km average hour on a lap 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.090
 soon there are few circuits that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.980
 we allow it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 yeah that's fast 185 because there's 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.340
 still two tight three turns 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.980
 especially the first chicane that has to 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.900
 go to 50 so to make the 180 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.530
 on a turn that means that the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 rest of the turn is fast
