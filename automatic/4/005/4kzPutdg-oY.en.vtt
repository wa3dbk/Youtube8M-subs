00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.590 
so the island palm mute strum has got
some<00:03:54.320> space<00:03:54.710> in<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.340> different<00:03:55.760> way<00:03:55.910> than

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
some space in it in a different way than

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.390 
some space in it in a different way than
when<00:03:56.720> we<00:03:56.870> played<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.380> just<00:03:57.680> lifting<00:03:58.100> up<00:03:58.250> our

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
when we played with just lifting up our

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.130 
when we played with just lifting up our
fingers<00:03:58.760> we're<00:03:58.910> actually<00:03:59.030> stopping<00:03:59.630> all<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
fingers we're actually stopping all the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.620 
fingers we're actually stopping all the
sound<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:01.190> gives<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.550> tight<00:04:01.970> feel<00:04:02.390> this

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
sound and it gives you a tight feel this

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.930 
sound and it gives you a tight feel this
is<00:04:02.810> really<00:04:03.200> useful<00:04:03.620> if<00:04:04.100> you're<00:04:04.370> backing<00:04:04.610> up

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940
