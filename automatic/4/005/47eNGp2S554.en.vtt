on<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:34.050> area<00:00:34.820> coccyx<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.860> if

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
on this area coccyx is right here so if

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.910 
on this area coccyx is right here so if
you<00:00:38.250> made<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.730> mean<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> brain<00:00:41.450> stream

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
you made you mean from the brain stream

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.130 
you made you mean from the brain stream
from<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> Princeton<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.700> area<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.870> go

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
from the Princeton this area all we go

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.299 
from the Princeton this area all we go
oh<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.750> area<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
oh we go to the end in this area that is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.380 
oh we go to the end in this area that is
a<00:00:50.370> total<00:00:50.969> spine<00:00:51.360> area<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> total<00:00:54.059> spine

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
a total spine area in the total spine

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.549 
a total spine area in the total spine
area<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.469> divided<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.460> five<00:00:57.320> equal<00:00:58.320> parts

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
area you are divided in five equal parts

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.840 
area you are divided in five equal parts
then<00:00:59.239> every<00:01:00.239> pastor<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> name<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> first

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
then every pastor has a name the first

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
then every pastor has a name the first
one<00:01:03.180> five<00:01:04.250> called<00:01:05.250> Civic<00:01:05.670> Opera<00:01:05.790> brain<00:01:06.710> Civic

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
one five called Civic Opera brain Civic

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
one five called Civic Opera brain Civic
oh<00:01:07.799> boy<00:01:07.950> oh<00:01:07.979> boy<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:09.630> give<00:01:09.869> them<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.110> name<00:01:11.119> c3<00:01:12.260> c4

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
oh boy oh boy we give them a name c3 c4

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.050 
oh boy oh boy we give them a name c3 c4
c5<00:01:13.850> c6<00:01:14.850> c7<00:01:15.500> now<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.790> we

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
c5 c6 c7 now take a look here if we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
c5 c6 c7 now take a look here if we
divide<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.600> 1/2<00:01:18.950> 1<00:01:19.950> 5<00:01:20.759> parts<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.119> section

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
divide in 1/2 1 5 parts so this section

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.190 
divide in 1/2 1 5 parts so this section
is<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> first<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.560> 5<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> safe<00:01:27.960> level

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
is the first one 5 that is a safe level

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
is the first one 5 that is a safe level
of<00:01:28.500> brain<00:01:29.270> c3<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.950> c4<00:01:32.270> c5<00:01:33.270> c6<00:01:34.369> c7<00:01:35.369> and

see mention l5 that is the happen tongue

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.570 
see mention l5 that is the happen tongue
here<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.599> s1<00:02:09.599> area<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.920> she<00:02:10.950> pick<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
here and s1 area so she pick up the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.890 
here and s1 area so she pick up the
message<00:02:11.940> when<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> demonstration

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
message when we do the demonstration

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.699 
message when we do the demonstration
ready

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
ready

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.940 
ready
yeah<00:02:14.120> okay<00:02:15.299> there's<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.780> lower<00:02:15.989> back<00:02:16.349> pain<00:02:16.650> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
yeah okay there's a lower back pain in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.429 
yeah okay there's a lower back pain in
that<00:02:17.250> particular<00:02:17.609> area

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
that particular area

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.670 
that particular area
okay<00:02:19.439> then<00:02:19.680> s<00:02:19.950> 1<00:02:20.540> 2<00:02:21.540> 3<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.079> right<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.500> this

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
okay then s 1 2 3 is right in this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.179 
okay then s 1 2 3 is right in this
section<00:02:22.859> so<00:02:23.719> if<00:02:24.719> you<00:02:24.900> know<00:02:25.079> how<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.379> beginning

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
section so if you know how to beginning

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.809 
section so if you know how to beginning
how<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.510> end<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.829> know<00:02:29.040> how<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> divide

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
how to the end if you know how to divide

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.470 
how to the end if you know how to divide
in<00:02:30.120> five<00:02:30.450> equal<00:02:31.139> parts<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:32.519> can<00:02:32.790> name<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in five equal parts you can name the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.550 
in five equal parts you can name the
number<00:02:33.719> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.439> spine<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.139> you<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
number of the spine and if you see the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.530 
number of the spine and if you see the
patient<00:02:38.129> where<00:02:38.909> was<00:02:39.379> abnormal<00:02:40.379> deformity<00:02:41.540> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
patient where was abnormal deformity you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.039 
patient where was abnormal deformity you
tell<00:02:42.810> him<00:02:43.049> where<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> problem

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
tell him where is a problem

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.809 
tell him where is a problem
like<00:02:46.049> if<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.409> find<00:02:46.680> patient<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> problem

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
like if you find patient as a problem

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.520 
like if you find patient as a problem
there<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.419> already<00:02:48.629> give<00:02:49.049> them<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.349> number

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
there you already give them the number

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.670 
there you already give them the number
you<00:02:50.069> tell<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.579> problem<00:02:51.000> usually<00:02:51.989> three

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you tell them the problem usually three

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.909 
you tell them the problem usually three
possibility<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.750> spine<00:02:55.169> is<00:02:55.470> serviced<00:02:55.889> a

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
possibility the spine is serviced a

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.240 
possibility the spine is serviced a
problem<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:57.810> time<00:02:58.079> it's<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.439> as<00:02:58.620> fine<00:02:58.859> is

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
problem or some time it's not as fine is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
determinant problem your machine will

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.259 
determinant problem your machine will
give<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> signal<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.040> not<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:05.969> spine

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
give you the signal and not in the spine
