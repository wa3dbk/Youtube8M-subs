is<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> tag<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.360> here

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
is that the tag this one is right here

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.730 
is that the tag this one is right here
in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> middle<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> other<00:01:37.380> glove

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in the middle but on the other glove

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
in the middle but on the other glove
it's<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> offset<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.509> another

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's kind of offset so just another

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's kind of offset so just another
quality<00:01:40.140> control<00:01:40.500> thing<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> big<00:01:41.369> deal<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
quality control thing not a big deal is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
quality control thing not a big deal is
the<00:01:41.729> tag<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.210> gonna<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the tag not gonna not going to do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.850 
the tag not gonna not going to do
anything<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.399> nothing<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.640> noticed<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
anything but just nothing I noticed so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
anything but just nothing I noticed so
sticky<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.369> bad<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> lovely<00:01:47.970> use<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> really

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
sticky not bad the lovely use is really

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810 
sticky not bad the lovely use is really
pretty<00:01:49.229> nice<00:01:49.500> leather<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> good

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pretty nice leather so it has a good

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.389 
pretty nice leather so it has a good
thick<00:01:51.149> feel<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:52.229> very<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.950> similar

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
thick feel to it I'm very very similar

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.090 
thick feel to it I'm very very similar
to<00:01:53.579> those<00:01:53.790> triumphs<00:01:54.350> United<00:01:55.350> Death<00:01:55.890> Adder

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to those triumphs United Death Adder

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.270 
to those triumphs United Death Adder
gloves<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.579> had<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:57.000> some

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
gloves I had very some

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.910 
gloves I had very some
cut<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.850> cut<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.479> leather<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:58.990> believe<00:01:59.740> these

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
cut of cut of leather I believe these

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.810 
cut of cut of leather I believe these
gloves<00:02:00.159> are<00:02:00.340> again<00:02:00.820> made<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.150> Pakistan<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
gloves are again made in Pakistan so the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.640 
gloves are again made in Pakistan so the
craftsmanship<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.420> not<00:02:04.600> too<00:02:04.750> bad<00:02:04.930> overall<00:02:05.380> so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
craftsmanship is not too bad overall so

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.289 
craftsmanship is not too bad overall so
I<00:02:05.890> will<00:02:06.190> probably<00:02:06.310> give<00:02:06.549> visa<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:07.030> know<00:02:07.119> maybe

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
I will probably give visa you know maybe

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.059 
I will probably give visa you know maybe
a<00:02:07.390> six<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> half<00:02:07.990> seven<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.530> ten<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.890> far

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
a six and a half seven out of ten as far

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.499 
a six and a half seven out of ten as far
as<00:02:09.160> craftsmanship<00:02:09.729> goes<00:02:09.910> could<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.300> little

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
as craftsmanship goes could be a little

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.030 
as craftsmanship goes could be a little
bit<00:02:10.600> tighter<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.500> definitely<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
bit tighter but definitely I have the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.520 
bit tighter but definitely I have the
potential<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.550> be<00:02:12.730> an<00:02:13.180> awesome<00:02:13.540> glow

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
potential to be an awesome glow

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.260 
potential to be an awesome glow
if<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.430> stitching<00:02:15.760> gets<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.970> little<00:02:16.090> bit

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
if the stitching gets a little bit

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.300 
if the stitching gets a little bit
better<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.630> well<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:17.590> do<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.280> know

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
better as well they do have you know

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.770 
better as well they do have you know
vented<00:02:18.730> holes<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:19.090> here<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.450> keep<00:02:19.630> your

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
vented holes right here so keep your

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.960 
vented holes right here so keep your
hands<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.140> little<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.440> cooler<00:02:20.800> around<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
hands a little bit cooler around the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
hands a little bit cooler around the
thumb<00:02:22.150> as<00:02:22.270> well<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.010> minted

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280

with the gold attachment which is kind

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.009 
with the gold attachment which is kind
of<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.200> nice<00:02:29.320> touch<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.720> actual

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
of a nice touch going on to the actual

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.020 
of a nice touch going on to the actual
feeling<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.130> performance<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.790> glove

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
feeling of the performance of the glove

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.690 
feeling of the performance of the glove
the<00:02:34.420> performance<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.140> glove<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.920> would<00:02:36.580> say

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
the performance of the glove I would say

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.360 
the performance of the glove I would say
is<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:37.150> pretty<00:02:37.360> nice<00:02:37.540> they<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.709> thicker

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
is it's pretty nice they have a thicker

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.120 
is it's pretty nice they have a thicker
foam<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.390> not<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.780> thin<00:02:41.410> as<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
foam it's it's not as thin as the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.640 
foam it's it's not as thin as the
winnings<00:02:42.459> glow<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:44.050> might<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.440> little

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
winnings glow so it might be a little

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.080 
winnings glow so it might be a little
bit<00:02:44.769> thicker<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> layer<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.850> when<00:02:46.000> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
bit thicker of a layer so when you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.690 
bit thicker of a layer so when you
definitely<00:02:46.480> make<00:02:46.630> contact<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.140> something

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
definitely make contact with something

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.280 
definitely make contact with something
it<00:02:48.700> doesn't<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> same<00:02:49.450> springiness<00:02:49.989> or

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it doesn't have the same springiness or

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.050 
it doesn't have the same springiness or
a<00:02:50.319> pop<00:02:50.560> as<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.800> winning<00:02:51.069> does<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.610> has

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
a pop as a winning does this one has

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.660 
a pop as a winning does this one has
more<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.450> thud<00:02:52.720> feeling<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.459> it's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
more of a thud feeling to it so it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.210 
more of a thud feeling to it so it's
definitely<00:02:54.850> more<00:02:55.269> pillowy<00:02:55.720> feeling<00:02:56.380> where

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
definitely more pillowy feeling where

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.940 
definitely more pillowy feeling where
you<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.850> have<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.000> push<00:02:58.239> down<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.690> even<00:02:58.950> to

you really have to push down to even to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.280 
you really have to push down to even to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
could be kind of frowned upon depending

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.520 
could be kind of frowned upon depending
on<00:03:03.730> who<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.480> know<00:03:04.570> kind<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.500> know

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
it kind of has a lot of resistance back

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.210 
it kind of has a lot of resistance back
there<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.480> if<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.380> want<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.860> use<00:03:20.950> these<00:03:21.040> for

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
not the the best glove for that that

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.020 
not the the best glove for that that
they<00:03:26.500> do<00:03:26.560> come<00:03:26.769> with<00:03:26.920> some<00:03:27.070> standard<00:03:27.579> laces

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
they do come with some standard laces

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.030 
they do come with some standard laces
that<00:03:28.150> are<00:03:28.269> long<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.750> can<00:03:28.900> tie<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:29.680> your<00:03:29.709> wrist

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.580 
that are long you can tie up your wrist
one<00:03:30.940> thing<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.269> wish<00:03:31.750> was<00:03:31.900> improved<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.410> these

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
one thing I wish was improved on these

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.400 
one thing I wish was improved on these
gloves<00:03:32.799> as<00:03:33.010> well<00:03:33.040> was<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.079> actual<00:03:35.079> wrist

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
gloves as well was the actual wrist

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.630 
gloves as well was the actual wrist
support<00:03:36.359> typically<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.840> like<00:03:38.560> wrist<00:03:39.310> support

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
support typically I like wrist support

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.840 
support typically I like wrist support
that's<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.880> little<00:03:40.060> bit<00:03:40.239> thicker<00:03:40.510> than<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.980> so

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
that's a little bit thicker than this so

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.539 
that's a little bit thicker than this so
it<00:03:42.970> acts<00:03:43.150> like<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.359> splint<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:44.680> almost<00:03:45.430> like

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
it acts like a splint like almost like

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.979 
it acts like a splint like almost like
trees<00:03:45.850> are<00:03:46.060> where<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.480> tree<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:46.959> you

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
trees are where you have a tree then you

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.360 
trees are where you have a tree then you
have<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.260> two<00:03:47.350> pieces<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.680> wood<00:03:47.799> on<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.160> side

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
have the two pieces of wood on the side

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.759 
have the two pieces of wood on the side
where<00:03:48.609> it<00:03:49.060> holds<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.720> tree<00:03:49.930> up<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.410> holds<00:03:50.650> it

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
where it holds the tree up and holds it

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.560 
where it holds the tree up and holds it
so<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.190> grow<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.579> roots<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.910> grow<00:03:52.090> the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
so it can grow in the roots can grow the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.370 
so it can grow in the roots can grow the
same<00:03:52.720> thing<00:03:52.930> with<00:03:53.079> these<00:03:53.230> same<00:03:53.709> concept<00:03:54.190> where

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
same thing with these same concept where

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.360 
same thing with these same concept where
two<00:03:56.380> pieces<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.739> foam<00:03:56.890> should<00:03:57.130> be<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> little

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
two pieces of foam should be a little

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.920 
two pieces of foam should be a little
bit<00:03:57.519> thicker<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:57.820> when<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.209> tie<00:03:58.390> these<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.780> it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
bit thicker so when you tie these up it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.270 
bit thicker so when you tie these up it
types<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.290> down<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.739> holds<00:03:59.920> your<00:03:59.980> wrist<00:04:00.160> in

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
types it down and it holds your wrist in

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.550 
types it down and it holds your wrist in
place<00:04:00.519> so<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.600> if<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.780> make<00:04:01.959> contact<00:04:02.440> with

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
place so that if you make contact with

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.710 
place so that if you make contact with
something<00:04:02.910> your<00:04:03.910> hand<00:04:04.150> doesn't<00:04:04.420> do<00:04:04.510> one<00:04:04.630> of

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720
