00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.180
 Hello everyone I am h welcome to my 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.240
 first video today I bring you an analysis 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.100
 of skating dedicated to those people 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.369
 that have not yet tried this magnificent 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.369
 game 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 our beginnings as they have been 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 custom in previous installments of the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.690
 saga will be somewhat convulsive 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.670
 or not sometimes but almost at the beginning of 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.520
 game we will have to take our 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.650
 first big decision that will be to choose 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.830
 our race with the virtues and defects 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.230
 that each of them involves once 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.240
 be this chosen we will decide the features 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.410
 of our character and we could 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.410
 customize to our liking 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.350
 once our first 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.480
 decisions and after a brief 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.140
 history will leave us free for the world 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.390
 of skating a world more than broad 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 in which we will have to dedicate our 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 time explore that yes once 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 explored the different locations 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 we will have the option to travel fast 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 the best option to travel around the world 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.579
 of skating will be on our backs 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.229
 horse 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 still be attentive as we can 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 meet with different events 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.560
 random by the way that yes no 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.840
 doubt the incredible landscapes that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 we can observe meanwhile 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.200
 the guys from bz have not spared 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.750
 efforts in the graphic section 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.789
 but do not doubt for a moment that these 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.770
 trips will not be full of danger 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.170
 we'll have to face each other with 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.689
 undead wizards witches 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.789
 skeletons giant animal spiders 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.429
 wild human trolls and an infinity 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.759
 of enemies that will aim 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.980
 remove it 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.959
 we can fight in first and second 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.500
 person to face so many 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.269
 enemies 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.850
 we will have an extension to the weapons 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.620
 where to choose 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.780
 we should try to find a balance 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.140
 between our locks and our 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.140
 attacks 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.540
 but we do not have to face 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.400
 only to these dangers since we can 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.920
 count on the inestimable help of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 different comrades or mercenaries that 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.060
 we will find throughout our 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.560
 trip but if we talk about companions not 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.450
 we can stop talking about the best friend 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.730
 of the man who will not hesitate to protect us 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.620
 of any enemy if you have to stand out 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 some enemy in Skyrim without doubt are the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.550
 dragons undisputed protagonists of 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.020
 the main plot of the story since 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.080
 for something we are the dragon's blood 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.660
 and these will cross our path in 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.030
 many times once defeated 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.220
 We will absorb his soul which will serve 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.580
 to activate some powers called 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.580
 shouting 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 but to do it first we will have to 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.740
 find the ancient runes that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.740
 hide the different powers 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.420
 powers such as the strength that we 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.989
 will allow to knock down our enemies 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.189
 or else the power to slow down the time 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.340
 moving us faster than 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.340
 they 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.859
 but if what we like is the power and 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.290
 magic we have an indisputable site 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.390
 in the particular skype howard the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.489
 magic school of bernal where we 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.420
 will teach to be a great magician and we 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.420
 the missions will be missing 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.360
 so if we decide to develop 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 our magical abilities we can 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.410
 have skills such as those of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.060
 destruction where we will use 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.920
 different elementary machines for 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.840
 come to our enemy the invocation 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.210
 where we will invoke creatures that will fight 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.850
 for us this among many others 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.440
 machines now well if the mana fails us 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.590
 we can always use our 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.590
 sword 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.640
 when leveling up we will have to decide 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.660
 where to put our best point 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.550
 we can choose the magic that you do not 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.170
 health sister that will give us points of 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.079
 life or endurance that will increase our 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.609
 resistance and load capacity 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.229
 after this we will have to spend 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.310
 our skill points in the 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.060
 different skills that we are 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.130
 offer we can specialize 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.690
 These noticed a little tired of walking 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.280
 the cairo and we can go to recover 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.190
 forces and collect missions in the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.580
 different cities of the world or even 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.950
 we can have our own house more 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.670
 humble or luxurious depending on how much 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.950
 we are willing to be 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.320
 we can customize it by leaving 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.940
 our weapons on shelves or our 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.950
 mx armor 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.500
 but to earn us the right to have 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.170
 a house we will have to earn the favor 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.210
 of jazz in different cities 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.920
 to give us the title of shame this 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.920
 we will achieve it by doing missions to go 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.440
 even depending on the actions that 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.729
 we have taken in the egg it may be 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.030
 ask him to participate in political life 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.590
 of skype that yes in the cities we were 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.539
 it will demand that we have a behavior 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.349
 civic good we'll have to see the 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.349
 clear with the guards 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.270
 if we see ourselves in this situation we will have 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.240
 the options of paying a fine for 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.000
 our crime we resist arrest or 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.190
 go to jail 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.380
 very soon we will get used to this 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.780
 instead we choose the role of thief 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.150
 murderers 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.220
 we can even join brotherhoods 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.460
 that will help us develop these 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.460
 skills 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.199
 during the game will be essential 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.280
 have conversations with different 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.889
 characters 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.479
 to get information or take some 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.129
 important decision that you can that 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.650
 completely change the stress of 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.139
 our body for example decide between 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.210
 the life and death of a partner to 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.860
 we will often have the possibility to use 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.930
 our ability to persuade or 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.629
 try to bribe some character to 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.460
 achieve our goals but if the 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.650
 diplomacy will not fail we can always 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.630
 resort to other more effective methods 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.880
 but if what we want is a bit of 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.490
 action we can always catch the bow and 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.320
 the arrows and we would get married by the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.330
 keirin forests can find us 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.270
 with its successful fauna that counts from 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:30.760
 fox rabbit moose as muse among others 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.130
 once we get home to our 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.070
 target we can use your meat 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.500
 make leather with your skin and recover 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.240
 our arrows 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.250
 but this we can do with any 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.020
 enemies that we kill and we can leave it 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.020
 sown to put all the video 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.790
 but keep in mind that skyrim encloses 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.870
 many surprises hidden among them 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.870
 special frames 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.720
 travel the gloomy roads of 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.720
 skyrim turned into werewolves 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.130
 or who knows may on dates 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.300

 very rider without a head 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.700
