mystery box which is absolutely mental

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
mystery box which is absolutely mental
I'm<00:01:31.049> guessing<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.950> fact<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I'm guessing by the fact that it's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.539 
I'm guessing by the fact that it's a
power<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:33.750> next<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.920> park<00:01:35.220> machine

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
power thing next to the park machine

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
power thing next to the park machine
speed<00:01:35.850> color<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.570> might<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.869> similar

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
speed color there might be a similar

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749 
speed color there might be a similar
