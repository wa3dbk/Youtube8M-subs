00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
on the scenes again but my advice is

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.140 
on the scenes again but my advice is
gonna<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:26.019> tough<00:02:26.200> mentally<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:28.060> if

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
gonna be tough mentally but I think if

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.430 
gonna be tough mentally but I think if
you<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.569> through<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.410> can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you can get through that then you can

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.050 
you can get through that then you can
get<00:02:29.709> do<00:02:29.800> anything<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.459> over<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.880> easy

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060

anything<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:03.620> two<00:03:03.920> or<00:03:04.159> say<00:03:04.400> anything<00:03:04.430> bad

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
anything about two or say anything bad

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.220 
anything about two or say anything bad
about<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.629> you're<00:03:05.750> doing<00:03:05.900> your<00:03:06.079> job

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
about you that you're doing your job

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.780 
about you that you're doing your job
before<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.129> split<00:03:07.220> from<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.459> books<00:03:07.640> the

before you split from the books the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.369 
before you split from the books the
