00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 ah 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.070
 again from the digital world we dedicate 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.440
 a space to science and within the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.969
 science something as important as are the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.799
 animals wildlife is something that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.170
 we share with them like on earth 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.449
 and we are in the best place at least 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.060
 in this part of Spain to recreate 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.870
 precisely that fauna and that land in 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.550
 the one they live 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.290
 it's a pretty important job 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.060
 which is carrying out bioparc and 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.380
 we, as we are very curious and 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.510
 we want you to know a little bit 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.550
 more then let's talk to a person 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.010
 responsible among other things for the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.610
 health and bioparc conservation jesus 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 I remember thank you for coming veterinarian 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.930
 of bioparc and conservative two of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 professions together but that will require 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.480
 of a lot of experience and many 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 knowledge with the variety that you have 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.489
 here of animals yes yes yes yes of course yes 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.670
 are are two jobs a little bit maybe 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.540
 separate although they come together in many 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.190
 sites 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.079
 the conservative let's say is a little bit the one 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.909
 adjusts to animals 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.159
 Well, he makes decisions a bit in terms of 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.810
 its management and others and the veterinarian 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.240
 it was clearer not the one who takes care of his 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.310
 especially for preventive health issues 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.259
 also a bit in zoos 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.729
 we do a lot of work a little preventive 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.140
 with them we have the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.450
 feature in bioparc that you have 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 made own locations of many 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.369
 species and that you think good what 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.979
 you know, it affects the behavior of the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 animal and the physical state of health 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.330
 as psychic yes sure insurance to the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.549
 try to recreate a little habitat too 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.630
 What do we do in bioparc? 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.299
 we have to introduce a lot of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.110
 plants you do not see create a more 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.450
 rich then this creates a series of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.920
 new challenges for animals that makes 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.440
 have a little more life 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.060
 interesting thinks that zoos the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 main problem maybe is the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.630
 boredom since they have no enemies 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.640
 They do not have to look no food 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.220
 they have to look for the couple then 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.130
 give them a richer, more natural environment 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.049
 with plants with different even that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 can see different facilities outside 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.159
 it's very important I believe for them and 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.319
 that it was a rich environment and 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.550
 and appetizing the mixture was smiling 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.040
 with you because we are surrounded by 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.629
 lemurs that precisely so tense 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.629
 ebro environment and in ours because 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.660
 we are now is an installation in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.849
 that the public can enter with a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.040
 monitor and really here is where 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.739
 we already eliminated all the clear barriers 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.780
 then to the public that enters we say 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.730
 that we are in a little bit in the house of 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.860
 these animals we ask you not to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.940
 touch and do not feed them but 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.500
 they can do a little bit what 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.239
 want to not attend to those who 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.209
 come here to bioparc 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.610
 the lemurs are not in their house or 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.890
 in its place until the lemurs we are 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 we in their habitat they have as 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 your house this and therefore you have to 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.500
 respect those conditions that is and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.540
 It's also nice to see the reaction of the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.180
 public because really well when 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.920
 they pass the door yes they assume it is a 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 bit as well as sometimes when you go to the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.440
 nature and you go to the shore of a lake 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.530
 and really, he has to speak softly 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.569
 and you have to show that respect for 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.950
 nature that is also something that 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.430
 we want to transmit and it is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.219
 our 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.959
 more important that socialization that 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.060
 they have with them with the public and with 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.329
 you in this environment make them 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.670
 more sociable than they are naturally 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.400
 well the lemurs are very sociable they are 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.120
 very calm a very gentle species 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.590
 and then even in freedom in zones 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.389
 where there are visitors in Madagascar that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.420
 they are going to see them because they show up 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.969
 curious with people and well let's say 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.920
 that they are not scary animals like that 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.049
 that obviously these animals have 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.489
 born in a zoo and have seen the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.069
 people from the beginning and they are very 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.870
 accustomed to it I see that they want 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.159
 share with us the talk 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 I do not know but the fact is that it has not 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.400
 said nothing 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.930
 and good apart from lemurs that what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.270
 we are enjoying them is a 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.860
 pretty broad fauna because this is 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.610
 made in different habitas of different 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.890
 areas of the earth 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.060
 clear when when the old man reformed 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.310
 fuengirola zoo and bioparc was created 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.870
 He made the decision to bring some 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.239
 teach only jungle animals 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.610
 of the African jungle and the jungle 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.170
 Asian we have left a little bit out 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.210
 the American jungle that we hope that what 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.510
 better in the future we can do it but 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.310
 well a little the choice was a bit 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.140
 staff maybe because to the direction of 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.360
 bioparc what they like are the 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.520
 animals of the jungle and also thinks that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.350
 the jungles is the most fragile ecosystem 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.930
 that we have and where is the greatest 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.390
 biodiversity of the planet then it is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.760
 one of the points really where 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.250
 we humans have to work 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.290
 to conserve because if we lose a 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.030
 little piece of jungle we lose thousands of 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.220
 species is also wrong to lose a 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.050
 piece of sheet or desert but the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.240
 concentration that there is a jungle is 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.400
 really tremendous and it's maybe a 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.460
 priority that we put ourselves 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.620
 species that you have here in bioparc which 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.340
 I would highlight this as the most difficult 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.440
 most peculiar or the most particular good 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.380
 the most difficult for a veterinarian without 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:20.980
 doubt the Malaysian tapirs is an animal 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.340
 well, that's pretty peculiar 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.660
 delicate is perhaps the only species of 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.700
 the only species that we have not yet 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.070
 managed to reproduce in bioparc is one 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.320
 of our challenges a little bit that we carry 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.360
 time working with them but not only 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.930
 for us, let's say that for others 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.780
 zoos is a kind a bit 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.810
 delicate sensitive and good apart very 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.990
 threatened in freedom and well maybe it's a 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.610
 little the one that gives us the most work 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.080
 the whole species of which is was more 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.320
 proud of the difficulty he has 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.700
 could pose and have it here or even 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.210
 having managed to reproduce what 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.720
 is your animal stars based on that 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.460
 Of course there are others that I do not 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.710
 maybe I would say the orangutans to me 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.050
 personally, maybe also from 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.810
 that orangutans were small 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.330
 They have been an animal that fascinated me 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.220
 maybe because of that 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.080
 that independent life they lead in the 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:21.330
 jungle I do not know is to be the man of the jungle 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.090
 who lives in the trees and well also 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.530
 Well, shortly after I 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.710
 start working here because they had 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.439
 his first his first breeding and let's say that 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.300
 Well, yes, I have a friendship 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.680
 special with our orangutans 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.300
 Correct me if I'm wrong they say that the 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.939
 orangutan is the smartest of the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.280
 apes yes I think so yes I think so 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.719
 perhaps it is difficult to compare it with 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.729
 chimpanzees because chimpanzees have 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.659
 a greater reputation for using tools 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:50.069
 for example a lot of documentaries and 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.199
 having the chimpanzees a social life 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:54.449
 much more developed because they live in 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.969
 large groups and their groups are very 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.870
 humans 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.669
 Unfortunately especially in terms of 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.069
 the aggressiveness they show a bit like 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.870
 we, it seems that the seven 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.789
 Chimpanzees have been a little 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.539
 considered smart but the 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.460
 orangutans 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.279
 I would say that they go beyond maybe the 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.259
 Chimpanzees are smarter or more alive not 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.729
 q then seems to prove wrong the 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.199
 who know that maybe we're going to vote that 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.770
 much more karma or not clear but 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:22.800
 lately the latest research 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:26.100
 it's amazing and really the use of 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.470
 tools that were thought to be the 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.270
 chimpanzees were the only ones that did 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.760
 to catch termites and all this coming out 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.520
 in documentaries as orangutans 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.290
 they really do what happens is that of 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.060
 a slightly more discreet way does not 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:43.290
 they give both the mayor and the chimpanzees 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.550
 rojense because many thanks has been 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.350
 a pleasure to talk to you and us 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.780
 talking about pleasure what we are going to do 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.430
 is to give us a walk and good record 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.410
 some of the animals that are around here 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.540
 So for you to see what there is 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.540
 everything and also that they are like at home
