00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.660
 let's make the mass of drunk 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 for the ingredients are 350 grams of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.700
 150 butter flour 2 eggs one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 teaspoon of salt 35 grams of yeast 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.940
 as we see already the sponge is made and 75 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.280
 cubic centimeters of milk now let's go 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.920
 to move to the bowl of the mixer we place 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.350
 the dry ingredients and we're going to do 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.690
 nir we mix all the ingredients 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.329
 dry first and then we will add the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.300
 ingredients like butter yeast 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 the wet ingredients we make the hole 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.210
 in the center in which we dump the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 yeast the salt always around 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 then add the butter that should 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 be at room temperature neither cold nor 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.640
 warm the eggs and finally the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.089
 milk that should be cold or warm neither 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 very hot now then we will proceed 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.239
 to work with the mixer or blender 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 in this case it's kneader we start 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.809
 gently see you guys to start 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.210
 mix in a soft way a little more 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.580
 Quick 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 we are increasing the speed as 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.920
 that we see that I need more 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 speed to mix because it's a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.940
 mass that will be absorbing a lot 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.990
 flour will have to be a very dough 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.159
 soft although it seems that no 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.069
 this was a room temperature 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.170
 then in a warmer place the 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.119
 we will place for your leavened observe 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.380
 you who have already given more speed 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.869
 to the machine 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.789
 see how the mass is taking 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.640
 consistency and here we have the mass 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.920
 list and we remove in this way should not 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 to be a bread-type dough remember that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.990
 it has butter and egg this is the texture 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.990
 you have to have this mass of glitters 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.820
 it does not matter if you peel a little this is 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.820
 its texture 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.119
 Now let's put it in a bowl and the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.490
 we let rest approximately 15 o 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.600
 20 minutes in a warm place and she 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.600
 it has to double its size
