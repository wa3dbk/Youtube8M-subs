goes well with the chicken there's not a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.699 
goes well with the chicken there's not a
lot<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.670> other<00:02:31.970> extra<00:02:32.750> bits<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> pieces<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
lot of other extra bits and pieces to

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.770 
lot of other extra bits and pieces to
this<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.070> no<00:02:34.220> cheese<00:02:34.550> no<00:02:34.580> lettuce<00:02:35.209> no<00:02:35.390> tomato

this so no cheese no lettuce no tomato

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.110 
this so no cheese no lettuce no tomato
which<00:02:36.530> I'm<00:02:36.709> sure<00:02:36.920> would<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.550> some<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.970> their

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
which I'm sure would be in some of their

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.810 
which I'm sure would be in some of their
other<00:02:38.270> roles<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.770> wasn't<00:02:40.100> expecting<00:02:40.580> any<00:02:40.790> of

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
other roles so I wasn't expecting any of

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.650 
other roles so I wasn't expecting any of
that<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.240> for<00:02:41.570> what<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.500> advertised<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.660> and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that so for what it is advertised as and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.290 
that so for what it is advertised as and
especially<00:02:45.020> how<00:02:45.320> much<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.770> costing<00:02:46.300> being

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
especially how much it's costing being

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.620 
especially how much it's costing being
two<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.870> $8<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:50.180> pretty<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.390> no
