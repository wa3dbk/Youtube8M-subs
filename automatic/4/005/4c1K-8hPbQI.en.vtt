00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.190 

the<00:01:45.980> selection<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.640> wrestlers<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.330> pretty

the selection of wrestlers is pretty

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.650 
the selection of wrestlers is pretty
much<00:01:48.530> laughable<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.430> mean<00:01:49.610> look<00:01:50.000> at<00:01:50.150> this<00:01:50.360> I

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
much laughable I mean look at this I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.050 
much laughable I mean look at this I
know<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.680> know<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:52.040> was<00:01:52.190> meant<00:01:52.400> for<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> arcade

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
know I know it was meant for the arcade

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.480 
know I know it was meant for the arcade
so<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.540> lacks<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.870> lot<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.050> depth<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:54.680> they

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
so it lacks a lot of depth but they

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.130 
so it lacks a lot of depth but they
could<00:01:55.700> have<00:01:55.820> added<00:01:56.000> maybe<00:01:56.360> just<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.750> few<00:01:56.990> more

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.780 
annoying at times there's also a cage
that<00:04:59.140> will<00:04:59.290> sometimes<00:04:59.950> appear<00:05:00.190> around<00:05:00.670> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
that will sometimes appear around the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.880 
that will sometimes appear around the
ring<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.720> doesn't<00:05:02.050> change<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.350> gameplay

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
ring but it doesn't change the gameplay

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.670 
ring but it doesn't change the gameplay
it's<00:05:03.160> not<00:05:03.550> even<00:05:03.790> interactive<00:05:04.420> at<00:05:04.510> all<00:05:04.690> it's

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
it's not even interactive at all it's

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.440 
it's not even interactive at all it's
already<00:05:05.890> like<00:05:06.250> you're<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.640> cage<00:05:06.850> regardless

as you can't even exit the ring in a
normal<00:05:09.520> match<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.240> cage<00:05:10.480> is<00:05:11.280> simply

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280
