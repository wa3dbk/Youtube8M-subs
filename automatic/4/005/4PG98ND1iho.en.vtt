00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 just a month ago they became 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.839
 presented the new nikon d3000 300 den 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.240
 Of course, there is a right test 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.710
 later today the look in the box 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 in and above all what with the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.770
 new 18 55 mm vr srg kit lens so 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 and let's go with the d 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.750
 3300 with the v r2 kit so curious 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.449
 what i changed there okay i think 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 but I still watch it that way 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 First up here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.730
 of course, like x2, I'm interested 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.219
 not really in the benefit of that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 warranty cards for lenses camera and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 a small manual only in German 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.870
 language beautifully illustrated so I think 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.540
 times who had the camera all the swr 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.629
 very nice, I think so we come 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 here first time to the battery charger and we 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.170
 than have to stowed differently that you know 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.640
 probably already from many others 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 nikon novice cameras has been around 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.149
 many years nothing changed here the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.820
 older tvs why you still 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.609
 no hdmi cable has no usb cable 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 after the computer connection of the 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.390
 power adapter for the charger is stupid 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.630
 with subsequent sand sockets and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.549
 if we again , of course, exactly 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
 the right battery with the little one behind 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.060
 So again with the version 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 a bit more capacity compared 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.610
 to the predecessors and of course the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.009
 shoulder strap in black and in the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 well-known nikon entry-level class 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.960
 quality yes feels at least so 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 so quickly set aside with the whole 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.840
 clutter because now come first to v 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.939
 r2x objectively that its pretty nice 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.380
 was packed again and again two 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.229
 plastic bags doing a pretty big job 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.820
 to crackle 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.470
 we already have it completely 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.329
 especially because this little one 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 lok switch so you can not do that 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.890
 only from 18 to 55 mm turn but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.590
 take your parking space when you go 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.720
 so want that's I guess quite 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.070
 nice of the compact camera else everything 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.439
 again very cheap in the execution 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.380
 the cap on the back so quickly on to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.850
 highlight the the 3,300 at the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.600
 technical specifications has changed 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.250
 not much done but look very comfortable 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.979
 you can also see here I think 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.100
 nice this slightly rounded design is 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.470
 have to round as 3200 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.200
 Rear of nec key arrangement 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.550
 pretty much identical to 3200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.280
 really is not really what 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.360
 done here this tax criss-so 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 that it's all very well 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.390
 remained 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.430
 also the recording button mode selection so 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.690
 There really was not much done 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.040
 the cam must look around here so 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.360
 really otherwise almost one on one 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.770
 comparable bommer still fast that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.510
 objectively 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.910
 then we have the friends impression 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.460
 like the 3300 would come to you though 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.930
 you because the kit brings this here so 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.970
 would be the absolute beginner version 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.640
 In any case, if you like, pretty much 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.650
 compact are not cheap now but are 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.980
 a lot of plastic connections on the sides 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.800
 So everything for microphone usb accessories 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.210
 connection and and and you can think so 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.450
 do not even complain at both 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.100
 accessories software other is so far 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.560
 good in the hand and as I said relatively 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.180
 compact the whole so me too 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.690
 guess you can be very excited 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.970
 the test of the 3.300 if you like that 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.230
 unboxing video to the nikon d3000 300 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.090
 liked it then just let it happen 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.860
 a thumbs up for this 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.360
 video like in the comments couple 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.400
 Excitations still see everything volt 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.670
 in the test to the 3,300 maybe one 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 compared to 3200 no idea where else 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.480
 you will find two more nice ones 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.740
 unboxing videos linked here and here 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.180

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.950
 in it 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.360
 what is this for now first 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.380

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.380
