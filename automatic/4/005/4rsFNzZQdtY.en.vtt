00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all my friends on my channel 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.299
 youtube and welcome to this new self 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.260
 today I will explain how to download and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.309
 install cinema 4d r15 then the last one 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.940
 4d cinema version available then 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.039
 first you have to go to the first one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 link that will release description that will be 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 that of bittorrent 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.340
 if you don't already have it I recommend you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 use this torrent client indeed 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.399
 without this last program it will be 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.649
 impossible to download the file as 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 we will exploit the peer to peer to peer network 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 so perfect then if there is not 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 you have clicked on the purple button here e 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 do download bittorrent and once that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 would have downloaded it install it will be 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.770
 a simple be hazelnut installer 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 not even much to understand if you have windows 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.649
 7 or lower you will also need to bring your own 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 damon stools light which is a program 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.640
 to mount the file iso the file of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140
 file back we will have to download 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.979
 published on frets that downloads 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 free once it arrives here it flows 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.979
 away until you click here on the download there 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.439
 will download this software that it creates 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.270
 of the virtual drives so 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 be able to mount the file if you have it instead 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.549
 windows 8 in my case windows 8.1 not 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.509
 it will be necessary that this step in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.140
 as much as windows 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.069
 version 8 up to the bus 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.549
 also integrates a software of 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.439
 viewing of files iso see reopen 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.560
 quietly without needing 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.929
 external software the last file it is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.500
 what is the most important is 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.380
 the torrent file of cinema 4d r15 with 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.329
 the update is the archigen then you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.700
 click here only the download button 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.429
 and the file download will start 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.530
 torrents are 6 gb if I'm not mistaken 15 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:04.270
 could put even a couple of hours me 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.099
 already put two and a half hours but still the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.239
 back banks fairly greenish not 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.410
 you should have problems 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.750
 once the download is complete 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.500
 you will find with this max tron folder 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.599
 cinema 4d r15 and with the three files that are 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.110
 the iso file then the installer of the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.299
 program update is the bus file 3 which 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.400
 it will be nothing but the crack file 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.340
 so in order and start with the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.000
 open the file twice if you to 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 this error 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.329
 click on ok it means nothing 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 and here you will have the dvd drive r15 file 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.090
 this law falls back to us here 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.139
 we will have the iso montalto file if instead 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.780
 be Jesus from his studies as he will do lim 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.760
 praise of the monstrum only iso image that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.049
 you click twice and you will get a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 image 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.970
 let's meditate on mark strong start that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.069
 will be salty than the executable of the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.389
 program in this case is available 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.919
 even an Italian language therefore has it 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:04.970
 set click on ok it will load 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.760
 will start the installers 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.350
 of the software and here we are welcome 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.680
 in the stables 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.230
 we are on continue here you will have to enter i 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.850
 your sides in this case I don't think it is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.720
 need to enter it but anyway 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.720
 write something 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:33.290
 just for safety it was then gone 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.710
 in the downloaded folder then 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.350
 the one where you have your file 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.840
 4d cinema and open the mousse folder 3 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.550
 often cyclical and double-click 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:52.040
 even on an iso me image is blood 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.350
 usually and here you will have the mc4 application 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.870
 of r15 for security we will go to 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.830
 disable our antivirus that in 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.840
 this case the bill area installed but 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.640
 however it should be the stefan one 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.880
 we have when you line if you have windows 8 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:13.180
 default windows defender now 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.180
 that doesn't move you don't know where to look for it 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.130
 here we are and we have one on settings 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.230
 administrator of thin autumn the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.220
 defender 6 change 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.770
 and this because it is a file of chigi 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.720
 could detect it as malware though 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.390
 it is not because I have already tested it and therefore 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.300
 eliminate it because sometimes you do 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.940
 will open this very simple interface 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.090
 we should incense and standard here 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.840
 produced by us we say so purchased 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.820
 that will be cinema 4d genres ec era 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.430
 written that we have that software will have 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.020
 then copied the serial to the clipboard 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.180
 we do not return to the installer 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.310
 unfortunately this program will not be possible 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.390
 to close 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.060
 just give us a rate now and yes 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.670
 it will close the program better third 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.360
 right and we paste the serial that will be 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.650
 this christ 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.130
 we click on continue and we put the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.290
 4d cinema board continues we put 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.930
 always file this file here that you don't 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.470
 will be nothing but our software e 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.990
 install we read and accepted from 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.030
 a need installs now and here it will come 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.480
 written where we need to where it should 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.400
 put it in I leave the directory 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.440
 the default one and I click on create 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
 shortcuts in the desktop that could 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.610
 come back we find on install now by 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.550
 new or an installation we allow to 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.370
 make changes to the computer e 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.050
 an installation will start 115 8 minutes 7 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.060
 but also because I'm recording then 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.690
 I will pause again when we find ourselves at 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.920
 completed a perfect installation 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.110
 time the installation will be 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.960
 completed as we would have if he would 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.820
 set on the desktop will appear on 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.990
 4d cinema connection and we will have the 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.990
 the information that the installation 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.360
 as a result we start by clicking on 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.790
 end indeed we come up for safety and 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.280
 click on end it will end 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:24.450
 the installer we can also unmount i 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.520
 various various iso files we need to reassemble 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.540
 and proceed with the reactivation of the 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.210
 our antivirus 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.210
 in my case unfortunately windows defender 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:45.060
 ok let's hide it, the bee is 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.980
 ok now it should perfect reactivate 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.880
 so it defends I obviously have the antivirus 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.620
 kemboi of your possession then 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.780
 at this point we click the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.530
 times on the link file on the 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.940
 desktop 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.180
 the first one could take a while 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.530
 more time I warn you and as you see 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.400
 we have our 4d r15 cinema 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.770
 installed successfully 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.080
 now here will ask us for updates or 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.100
 in this case I do n't do them because I don't 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.040
 they also interest him because they are 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.220
 language reasoning 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.050
 need for now so our do the 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.670

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.490
 installed correctly so now 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.200
 you can easily use it 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.240
