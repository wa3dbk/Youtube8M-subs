00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.580
 to play bar that is a way to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.679
 carpets the box is tight coffee 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.259
 this sound so funny and good inside 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.759
 we will have a rules manual in a 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.219
 lots of languages ​​but the regulation 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.619
 basic is just a face this game what 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.000
 pillo nor nephew of seven years in five 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.640
 or ten minutes or you should not 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.070
 have no problem 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.130
 advertising a sachet 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.869
 where we will find hasan our 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.260
 doll that will accompany us in this 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.660
 adventure and a bag with coins 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.950
 values ​​of 1 and 5 also founder 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.800
 numbered from 1 to 4 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.290
 we also find this box with 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.570
 rugs of different colors like 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.570
 you can see and a tiny board 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.440
 the goal of marrakech is to be the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.190
 Player with the most carpets at the end 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 of the shift well as they went first 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.379
 what we have to do is distribute 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 we take the side obviously and we distribute 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.330
 30 coins to each player 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.060
 dejected we have our 30 controversies 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 down here 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.210
 the following according to the number of 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.460
 players that we will be sharing the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.560
 carpets to four players each 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.049
 You will receive twelve carpets of a color 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.719
 three players will receive three tacos 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.450
 complete and two players will receive 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:32.270
 two colors a total of 24 hours 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.729
 let's say I take for this example the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.680
 marine and the young woman as she gets more 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990
 house then well then we have to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.509
 place to hunt here in the center the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.770
 turn in marrakech is very simple what 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.280
 first thing we would have to do would be 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.110
 hunt war front or turn it on 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.229
 either side never give you the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.810
 return is worth in this case for example what 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.010
 we leave front and let's say our side 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.730
 move a box 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.450
 and to move you we take our 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.030
 carpets and we put one always playing 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 home in any direction forward if 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.850
 so behind always touching him one of the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.220
 halves of the carpet we can never 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.220
 put for example in diagonal vale 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.510
 then in this case it would happen to the player 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 next I could say at the end 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.599
 do the front loading directions 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.980
 we let him answer 412 what happens 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.970
 when Hassan arrives at one of our 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.340
 keep then as you can see all the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.110
 grids have a small symbol 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.650
 to make the turn that does not cost action 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.680
 then we will arrive here for example 12 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.209
 turns and 3 thousand 4 and in this case the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.760
 blue player would put another of the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.319
 rugs for example well 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.540
 the rules of placement of 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.390
 carpets tell us we can put it 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.000
 on empty squares or covering halves 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.310
 of another player's carpets for example 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.370
 imagine that we are here the player 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.519
 blue 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.940
 and says let's put this carpet like this 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.379
 plugging half yellow carpet this 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.360
 It is never allowed what is 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.360
 allowed would be to cover it completely 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.609
 although we can cover two halves 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.099
 imagine that yellow has this way 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.530
 and in this case by covering two halves 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.870
 different is totally allowed 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.939
 we can make the carpet towers 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.680
 all that we want although I arrived 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.629
 to have up to ten rugs in one 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 same almost what happens when hassan 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.439
 It falls on the carpet of another player as 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.450
 imagine that we are the yellow player 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.280
 and here we see in this player box 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.920
 blue that we will have to pay to the 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.530
 blue player a number of coins the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.959
 Amount to pay is given by the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.970
 number of adjacent squares that there is a 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.129
 same color for example let's imagine that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.739
 it's like this the diagonals we said 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.219
 they tell it so we would pay 1 2 3 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.910
 and 4 we will pay you 4 coins of our 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:05.340
 reserve the blue player for what 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.860
 if at any time a player stays 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.140
 no coins is removed and your carpets 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.990
 They are considered blank boxes 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.210
 game will continue this way by putting 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.310
 rugs left and right until 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.170
 that all players have been 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.269
 eliminated or the carpets are finished 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.250
 but the key to this game is to try 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.200
 to our adversary to surround him with 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.280
 our carpets we imagine that we are 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.920
 a blue player and we have achieved 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.390
 put us like this in this way the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.520
 next player would have it very difficult 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.470
 since you can only go front or turn 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 the arms would have it very difficult to 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.530
 do not fall into one of our rugs is 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.970
 say we have to increase the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.350
 possibilities that another player that 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.330
 there are some that are have all 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.910
 carpets the shift is over and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.070
 we proceed to the counting as the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.920
 count 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.480
 simple count all 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.180
 coins that we have 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.860
 and they add to the number of carpets 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.900
 visible that we have in this case the 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.330
 player would make two rugs visible 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.060
 for your coins and the blue player 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.310
 would have six visible rugs plus their 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.290
 currencies the one that has more points is the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600
 who wins in case of a tie wins the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.240
 player that has more coins and that's 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.120
 all marrakech a fast game very 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.650
 simple for all audiences and that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.060
 I assure you that it can be an authentic 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.210
 broke friends 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.210
 highly recommended but much later
