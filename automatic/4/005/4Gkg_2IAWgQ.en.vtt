00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
wouldn't really call it extreme like the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
wouldn't really call it extreme like the
package<00:01:24.930> says<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> does<00:01:26.040> work<00:01:26.220> pretty

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
ears flipping out a little more than

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770

to<00:02:01.020> him<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.829> calm<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to him really calm I like that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.350

although<00:02:03.220> maybe<00:02:03.430> when<00:02:03.640> he's<00:02:03.759> racing<00:02:04.210> you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
although maybe when he's racing you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.140 
although maybe when he's racing you
think<00:02:04.600> he'd<00:02:04.720> be<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> little<00:02:05.200> more<00:02:05.350> extreme<00:02:06.150> also

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
think he'd be a little more extreme also

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.270 
think he'd be a little more extreme also
like<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.509> red<00:02:07.780> tribal<00:02:08.349> triangle<00:02:08.950> on<00:02:09.099> his

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
like the red tribal triangle on his

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.330 
like the red tribal triangle on his
forehead<00:02:09.700> that's<00:02:10.179> cool<00:02:11.040> like<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.220> would

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
forehead that's cool like you would

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.309 
forehead that's cool like you would
expect<00:02:12.459> there<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.180> still<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> riding<00:02:13.900> Pig<00:02:14.110> on

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
expect there is still a riding Pig on

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.920 
expect there is still a riding Pig on
top<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.890> toothless's<00:02:15.370> saddle<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.720> works

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
top of toothless's saddle and it works

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.170

pretty well we've got hiccup here from

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.449 
pretty well we've got hiccup here from
the<00:02:19.330> new<00:02:19.510> line<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.959> course<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.410> well<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
the new line of course as well and it

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.250 
the new line of course as well and it
looks<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.940> writing<00:02:22.390> Pig<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.780> nice<00:02:23.020> and

looks like the writing Pig is nice and
thick<00:02:23.650> which<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.069> like<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.400> he's<00:02:24.790> not<00:02:24.940> going<00:02:25.060> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
thick which I like so he's not going to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
thick which I like so he's not going to
fall<00:02:25.390> off<00:02:25.630> there

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
