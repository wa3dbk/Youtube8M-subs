00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.150
 missing 14 turns the conclusion of the grand prix mica schumacher is always 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.240
 ahead avon pablo montoya the detachment of the Colombian radio according to 2 now 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.070
 montoia just before the variant ascari vote problem with waves 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.780
 voiced should have lost 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.360
 and in fact we see something in the counting of the second sector has lost straight 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 a second 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.270
 wow pablo montoya for this problem the dubbing from a breath of oxygen to 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.430
 micheal schumacher and that he had only a second and two advantage of the partner 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.260
 the completed dish will be missing 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 and will pass on the straight old arrival and after that we will be able to see the new one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.420
 advantage in regards to motor that in fact 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 it went up 2 seconds and 3 thanks to this dubbed 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.609
 breath of fresh air for mica schumacher who has two seconds 3d mantage 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.539
 glycoproteins montoia when there are 13 laps at the end of the grand prix of 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.149
 monza behind schumacher and montoia barrichello detached of 15 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.630
 seconds is resisting the attacks of kimi raikkonen is that the other pilot 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.060
 running for the world title r core de is looking in all ways of 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.710
 attack 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.140
 the red number 2 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.310
 we are in the course of the 44th lap so there are just under nine laps 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 to the conclusion chumacher own advantage in comparison to montorio of 3 seconds 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.299
 pes 6 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.460
 one advantage that in the last two three rounds is 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 is stabilized so this means that at this time of the race there 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.990
 ferrari and the same performances of Puglia if therefore and should not suffer 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.930
 more than that micheal schumacher to take home 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.360
 his and fifth win of the season but we wait for me to say why 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.070
 missing we repeat 8 laps to the conclusion what matters that after having 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.270
 suffered so much as performance finally schumacher seems to be 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.290
 freed of 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.159
 and the threat of montorio is that he can no longer approach even now 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.000
 the advantage rose to 5 seconds to 8, so let go of the grip 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.260
 montoia i will give her green light her will fail 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.190
 that we repeat Roman tagio of almost 6 seconds against the Colombian in the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.780
 Meanwhile 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 barrichello always manages to keep at a distance 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 raikkonen is that occupies the fourth position I miss in a barrel of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.150
 iron although now he is raising his hand from the wheel to rt invite pilot 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.310
 that precedes him a dubbed to get out of the way because michele schumacher o 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 7-second hold against montoia 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.310
 reassuring advantage but cannot have single-seaters that annoy you in front 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 to himself also because they could influence the hey soul raising of the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.010
 temperature for the engine, however, three laps are missing 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.189
 this moment to the conclusion monza hair 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.249
 3 will turn schumacher's conclusion commands with 7 and a half seconds against 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.580
 guam pablo montoya 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930
 meanwhile barrichello continues resisting attempts to attacks from 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.090
 part of kimi raikkonen and would be important for is the pilot of the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.480
 ferrari pilot number 2 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.930
 defend this position because it would take away valuable array points with n 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 A little later, for Schumacher's arrival, his life is ever closer 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 grand prix of soccer but that the last round of the great ones had begun 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.280
 monza's prize is less than a minute the arrival of this grand prize would be 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.140
 That skin is a very important victory 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.469
 for example, a German note is not remembered for 5 grand prizes 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.629
 mica schumacher at the curve of the pedobear menagerie resisted 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.569
 montoia attacks in the first lap there was a really exciting start 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.319
 with montoia 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.849
 fairy tale brought schumacher the flanked seems to have overtaken him with chumacher ha 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.659
 resisted 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.680
 then there was speck a fight of nerves on the edge of tenths of a second ne 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.169
 infischio I did but a great prize dissolved on the razor's edge 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.349
 photo mica schumacher ca gritted his teeth he resisted squeezing his ferrari 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.719
 up to the init 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.569
 and then montoia 5 6 laps ago he gave up he realized that there was nothing left from 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.239
 do now is retaining the second position here it is mica schumacher e 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.279
 sure you pull that brings the last parabolic thermal curve to schumacher and then 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.090
 it will be the triumph in front of 90,000 spectators who are already crazy here 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.069
 in front of the stands 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.439
 picasso but that is about to cross the finish line 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.569
 wins the grand prize of Italy and maintains the cabin of the championship of 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.150
 world 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.220
 increasing by two points of advantage against montorio now from +1 the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.159
 advantage triumphs to +3 psychologically very important this triumph of 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.459
 schumacher and polposition to victory the fast turn for the German kiln and one 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.540
 a setback to montorio is that by now he seemed to have overcome it I like myself but yes 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.129
 wins 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.169
 because in short Italy also good rubens barrichello because it keeps the 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.540
 third position defending against tac or viral
