00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
experienced a team they've got a student
squad<00:01:40.799> young<00:01:41.040> players<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.820> has<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> lot<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
squad young players that has a lot of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
squad young players that has a lot of
cap<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.750> far<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.590> i<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.400> be<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
cap so far so i think it's going to be a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.000 
cap so far so i think it's going to be a
vehicle<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.150> physical<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.140> physical<00:01:46.979> game

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
vehicle very physical very physical game

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.880 
vehicle very physical very physical game
fast<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.710> hard

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
fast and then and it's going to be hard

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730 
fast and then and it's going to be hard
one<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.250> us<00:01:50.450> our<00:01:51.450> defenses<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> last

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
one for us our defenses up to the last

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.640 
one for us our defenses up to the last
game<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.479> not<00:01:54.479> too<00:01:54.630> bad<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.080> just<00:01:55.290> considered

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
game was not too bad we just considered

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.730 
game was not too bad we just considered
over<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.070> try<00:01:56.340> /<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.909> test<00:01:57.180> match<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.619> see

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
over one try / the test match we can see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.200 
over one try / the test match we can see
that<00:01:58.860> five<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.460> dogs<00:01:59.610> also<00:01:59.759> considered

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that five or the or dogs also considered

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
that five or the or dogs also considered
for<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.439> not<00:02:01.979> happy<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.090> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
for so not happy of that I think if we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.700 
for so not happy of that I think if we
defend<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.720> bit<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.619> know

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
defend it be a bit of one that you know

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.679 
defend it be a bit of one that you know
the<00:02:04.829> championship<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.600> had

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the championship and because we had

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.240 
the championship and because we had
enough<00:02:06.900> chances<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.380> attacks<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.890> David<00:02:08.099> not

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
enough chances and attacks are David not

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.339 
enough chances and attacks are David not
that<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.149> defense<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.140> probably

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
that if the the defense that's probably

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.280 
that if the the defense that's probably
job<00:02:10.799> will<00:02:11.129> make<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> huge<00:02:11.459> difference<00:02:12.050> we<00:02:13.050> need

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
job will make a huge difference we need

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.630 
job will make a huge difference we need
to<00:02:13.410> keep<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.800> improving<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> defense

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
to keep on improving on the defense

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.920 
to keep on improving on the defense
that's<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.090> thing<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.690> look<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's one thing and if you look at the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.130 
that's one thing and if you look at the
World<00:02:16.110> Cups

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
World Cups

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.020 
World Cups
and<00:02:17.490> championships<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.610> traffic<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.000> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and championships and traffic so that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.550

matches is always the best team
defensively<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.430> advance<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.240> that's<00:02:22.720> one

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
defensively not advance so that's one
