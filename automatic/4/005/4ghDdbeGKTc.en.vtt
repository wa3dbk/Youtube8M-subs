 mother who I refreshed several times up 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 when it started to double by 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.740
 25 30 degrees 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.990

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.940
 leavened I remove the basin e 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.940

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.970
 [Music] 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.700
 with the cut from the part mentioned above 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.700
 from the other flour and cover it 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.960
 they will leave them to rise again until 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.520
