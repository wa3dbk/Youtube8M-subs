 how we live by fire 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.710
 and live zagun it every day to think about 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.969
 beautiful and rock and roll 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.259

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:05.779
 in terms of perception and conduct I when 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:10.039

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:12.619
 love both music and organs photography 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 because the people who do it 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:19.219
 burning fire 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:22.669

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:31.729

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:59.110
 different styles

 but starting from dark hardcore and ending 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.319
 frank sinatra in general i think that 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:09.589
 classic is what goes with her 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:12.229

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:20.180
 there will always be a classic frag and butterflies this 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:22.430

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.270
 so that people believe in their dream 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.260
 living by fire means living once 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.620
