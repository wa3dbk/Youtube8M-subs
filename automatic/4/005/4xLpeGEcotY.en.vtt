pictures<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> i<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.670> saw<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.149> what

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pictures of this and i just saw at what

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
pictures of this and i just saw at what
I<00:00:54.539> saw<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.989> website<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> thought<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I saw it on a website and I thought it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
I saw it on a website and I thought it
was<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:55.920> cool<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.399> was<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.789> right

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
was really cool and I was like all right

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
was really cool and I was like all right
this<00:00:57.660> shouldn't<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:57.989> too<00:00:58.079> difficult<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.770> build

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this shouldn't be too difficult to build

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
this shouldn't be too difficult to build
i<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.219> i'll<00:00:59.309> build<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
i think i'll build it and it is going to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
i think i'll build it and it is going to
be<00:01:01.379> huge<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:03.149> doesn't<00:01:03.449> even<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
be huge it doesn't even really look that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
be huge it doesn't even really look that
big<00:01:04.379> yet<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.070> hasn't<00:01:05.309> been<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
big yet because that hasn't been the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
big yet because that hasn't been the
walls<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> been<00:01:06.299> made<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.710> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
walls have been made up but even now you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
walls have been made up but even now you
know<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> looks<00:01:08.220> massive<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.990> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
know it looks massive and this is going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.580 
know it looks massive and this is going
to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:11.070> big<00:01:11.220> building<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to be a really big building it it is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.870 
to be a really big building it it is
basically<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> straight<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.460> someone<00:01:14.820> who

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
basically to straight up someone who

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
basically to straight up someone who
building<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.600> 50<00:01:15.990> blocks<00:01:16.170> high<00:01:16.470> if

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
building this probably 50 blocks high if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.260 
building this probably 50 blocks high if
not<00:01:16.770> higher<00:01:16.950> basically<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.880> high<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.090> i<00:01:18.240> can

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
not higher basically as high as i can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.410 
not higher basically as high as i can
build<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.549> talking<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> burning<00:01:21.270> he

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
build up and I was talking to burning he

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.429 
build up and I was talking to burning he
said<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.020> interested<00:01:22.350> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
said that he would be interested in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
said that he would be interested in
helping<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.280> i<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.670> i'll<00:01:23.790> prob

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
helping with this i think i'll prob

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
helping with this i think i'll prob
probably<00:01:24.360> end<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.689> being<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> co<00:01:25.140> built<00:01:25.350> between

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
probably end up being a co built between

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
probably end up being a co built between
me<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.920> him<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> maybe<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.570> people

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
thing and it's it that's probably good

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
thing and it's it that's probably good
because<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
because this is going to take a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
because this is going to take a
ridiculous<00:01:37.049> amount<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.380> cobblestone<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
ridiculous amount of cobblestone as you

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.219 
ridiculous amount of cobblestone as you
can<00:01:38.700> already<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.240> taken<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.750> ton<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can already see it's taken up a ton and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
can already see it's taken up a ton and
I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.770> taken<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.189> three<00:01:41.340> full

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
I think it's taken about three full
chest<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> cobblestone<00:01:42.990> already<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> do

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

because<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.070> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> be

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
because this is just going to be

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.750 
because this is just going to be
ridiculously<00:02:36.660> huge<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.280> said<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.640> going

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
ridiculously huge like I said it's going

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
ridiculously huge like I said it's going
to<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.060> 50<00:02:39.390> blocks<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.260> all

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
to be like 50 blocks up and then all

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
to be like 50 blocks up and then all
these<00:02:41.310> towers<00:02:41.850> end<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.209> being<00:02:42.480> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> like

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
these towers end up being kind of like

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.180 
these towers end up being kind of like
you<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.380> castle<00:02:43.709> turrets<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
you know the castle turrets and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.670 
you know the castle turrets and
basically<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.150> plan<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.720> since<00:02:46.560> it's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
basically the plan is that since it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.110 
basically the plan is that since it's
it's<00:02:46.980> built<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> water<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:47.940> just

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's built on the water here just

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.759 
it's built on the water here just
because<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.300> nice<00:02:48.570> flat<00:02:48.870> surface<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.290> build<00:02:49.590> on

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
because a nice flat surface to build on

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.470 
because a nice flat surface to build on
because<00:02:50.070> if<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.400> had<00:02:50.519> tried<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.820> flatten<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
because if I had tried to flatten out a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.540 
because if I had tried to flatten out a
window<00:02:51.810> area<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.739> line<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.130> big<00:02:53.340> would<00:02:53.459> have

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
window area of line this big would have

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.120 
window area of line this big would have
been<00:02:53.640> impossible<00:02:53.870> but<00:02:54.870> basically<00:02:55.560> what<00:02:56.010> I'm

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
been impossible but basically what I'm

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.830 
been impossible but basically what I'm
going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.370> doing<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.790> making<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.390> area

building<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.410> reason<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:14.070> decided

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
building and the reason that I decided

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.069 
building and the reason that I decided
to<00:03:14.940> build<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:15.780> own

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
to build this is kind of my own

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.590 
to build this is kind of my own
iteration<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.829> building<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:18.060> on

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
iteration of the building is because on

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.800 
iteration of the building is because on
the<00:03:18.780> actual<00:03:19.110> building<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.739> entrance<00:03:20.280> is

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the actual building the entrance is

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.270 
the actual building the entrance is
located<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> skinny<00:03:23.160> side

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400 
located down there on the skinny side
and<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.870> didn't<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:24.959> think<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.230> that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
and I didn't really think that that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.440 
and I didn't really think that that
looks<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:25.799> good<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.730> was<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:27.239> like

one hour on sunday night and depending

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.090 
one hour on sunday night and depending
on<00:05:00.840> how<00:05:00.990> long<00:05:01.230> i<00:05:01.440> end<00:05:01.560> up<00:05:01.620> having<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.950> live

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
on how long i end up having to live

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.950 
on how long i end up having to live
stream<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.640> will<00:05:03.120> determine<00:05:03.570> really<00:05:03.780> when<00:05:03.930> I

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
stream for will determine really when I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.480 
stream for will determine really when I
will<00:05:04.200> start<00:05:04.410> live<00:05:04.560> streaming<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.010> put<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.220> but

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
will start live streaming to put it but

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.070 
will start live streaming to put it but
you<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.760> pretty<00:05:05.970> much<00:05:06.060> guess<00:05:06.390> that<00:05:06.600> do<00:05:06.690> i<00:05:06.720> will

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
you can pretty much guess that do i will

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.010 
you can pretty much guess that do i will
start<00:05:07.290> between<00:05:07.940> five<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:08.970> seven<00:05:09.510> maybe<00:05:09.720> even

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
start between five and seven maybe even

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.820 
start between five and seven maybe even
4<00:05:10.470> p.m.<00:05:10.940> that's<00:05:11.940> 5<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.330> 7<00:05:12.630> p.m.<00:05:13.320> eastern<00:05:13.800> time

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
4 p.m. that's 5 to 7 p.m. eastern time

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.500 
4 p.m. that's 5 to 7 p.m. eastern time
and<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.820> i<00:05:14.910> said<00:05:14.970> maybe<00:05:15.180> use<00:05:15.390> before

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
and like i said maybe use before

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.240 
and like i said maybe use before
depending<00:05:15.990> on<00:05:16.080> how<00:05:16.230> long<00:05:16.440> after<00:05:16.620> live<00:05:16.980> stream

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250

y at 12pm i'll cut off the likes and
then<00:05:35.970> i'll<00:05:36.120> probably<00:05:36.360> just<00:05:36.510> round<00:05:36.810> up<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.200> the

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
then i'll probably just round up to the

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.500 
then i'll probably just round up to the
nearest<00:05:37.470> hour<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.950> half<00:05:38.160> hour<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.240> know<00:05:39.450> if

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
nearest hour a half hour so you know if

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.450 
nearest hour a half hour so you know if
we<00:05:39.630> get<00:05:39.780> like<00:05:39.870> 150<00:05:40.530> likes<00:05:40.740> I'm<00:05:40.919> that<00:05:41.070> round<00:05:41.280> up

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
we get like 150 likes I'm that round up

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.880 
we get like 150 likes I'm that round up
to<00:05:41.640> like<00:05:41.820> what<00:05:42.390> is<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:42.510> three<00:05:42.840> hours<00:05:43.140> so

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
to like what is that three hours so

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.360 
to like what is that three hours so
maybe<00:05:44.700> or<00:05:44.910> maybe<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.150> think<00:05:45.479> that<00:05:45.630> if<00:05:45.720> it's<00:05:45.870> over

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
maybe or maybe I think that if it's over

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.650 
maybe or maybe I think that if it's over
I'll<00:05:47.370> basically<00:05:47.610> go<00:05:47.880> in<00:05:47.970> 15<00:05:48.360> minute<00:05:48.570> intervals

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
I'll basically go in 15 minute intervals
