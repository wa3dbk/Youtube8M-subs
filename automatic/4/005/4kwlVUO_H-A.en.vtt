also has a rocket legs that allowed him

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.289 
also has a rocket legs that allowed him
allow<00:01:25.350> him<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:26.340> charged<00:01:26.670> attacks<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
allow him to have charged attacks and so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.350 
allow him to have charged attacks and so
forth<00:01:27.600> what's<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.470> cool<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.680> these

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
forth what's really cool about these

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
forth what's really cool about these
swap<00:01:30.360> force<00:01:30.570> characters<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
swap force characters is because you can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920 
swap force characters is because you can
mix<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.610> match<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> top<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> bottom

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
mix and match the top and the bottom

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.710 
mix and match the top and the bottom
half<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:35.250> create<00:01:35.490> new<00:01:36.090> combinations

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
half you can create new combinations

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.910 
half you can create new combinations
like<00:01:37.130> Magnezone<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.930> Magnum<00:01:39.930> buckler<00:01:40.290> oh<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
like Magnezone and Magnum buckler oh I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
like Magnezone and Magnum buckler oh I
see<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.640> named<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
see and so they named in that way so

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
see and so they named in that way so
that<00:01:43.020> each<00:01:43.380> each<00:01:43.799> character<00:01:44.100> has<00:01:44.130> two<00:01:44.430> parts

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that each each character has two parts

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
that each each character has two parts
of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> name<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.390> exactly<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.350> each

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
