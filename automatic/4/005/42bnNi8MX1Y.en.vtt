 something to do with you in it 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.840
 In his eyes, royally, you are dead to 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.180
 no time he cared to know 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.460
 need of under he abandoned you ben good 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.360
 tip of the nose look 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.760
 Allo Remy told them never got anything 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.850
 had to do with you you thought you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.210
 was his friend but you dreamed not dream 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.100
 my guy you were nothing to him 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.260
 were the first one what you 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.190
 would accompany him in his journey that you 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.960
 would live great adventure with him 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.270
 but what are you naive 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.760
 you really believed that stuff 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.580
 be careful huh I'm not saying that to be 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.370
 naughty I just want to make sure you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.280
 understand and that it fits well in your 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.740
 little brain kfw miller said 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.480
 laughed at you all the way 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.150
 you were not his friend you were just 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.790
 how could we say that a shield 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.760
 alive how yeah that's what you 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.190
 was a simple shield pouy 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.660
 they knew very well that you are weak 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.640
 that you were going to slow him down 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.560
 but if he still accepted that kevin 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.080
 with him it was because he had said to himself 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 that you could be useful to him 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.460
 taking the shots in his place 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.600
 no you want a proof the first fight 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.670
 that you did together 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.620
 what happened was he that 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.410
 send to fight first and you're 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.350
 blow up the mouth I knew how to go 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.750
 I'm mulled if we went willingly and 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.760
 why tell me why you went there 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.530
 you wanted to prove anything was 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.990

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.030

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.130

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.560

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 given reason that's why he has 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.440
 let you die because it was 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.500
 even more useful as a shield 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.680
