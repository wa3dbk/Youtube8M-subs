00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
 Brother is liking channels, so when you see 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.619
 in the video you have now debated I do not know 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.760
 why I created here but anyway guys 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.350
 the debate is about bergman comes up and roll 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 I remember that I did a talking debate 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 bighman endress factor pink legal era 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.820
 has history's choices for whom 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.280
 accompanies the king but at last I made a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 video talking of the big factor mou he 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.570
 Bighman died but at last I did the saying. 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.740
 a little of what I thought happened 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.659
 with the saints but I see that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.369
 especially not many people 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 keep asking me what I think the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 sam has happened to the angels where 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 he was 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 and the mother of the dishes will have to give up will be 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.520
 That they were allied to the glass. Come on. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 The next I do not have much idea of ​​what 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.640
 can happen if an alliance rolls 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.070
 or not between abc mozzo I believe 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.200
 yes abinee the mother of the squid but I do not know 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.049
 If she's going to get in josa 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.479
 Because then I think it's yours and 11 to 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.190
 government power and I think the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.149
 The world's time bank needs to get out of this 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 alone 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.720
 even being in full 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.810
 It's good I think at first 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.660
 will not roll an alliance even student 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.080
 knowing from the abg release that they are 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.570
 friends of her daughter of course stay clear 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.160
 war gives up so has this is to be 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.960
 My daughter's friend declared war on 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.600
 I'm worth that first contact 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.480
 between the victim's bank and bunch of 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.400
 real estate will not be at all friendly what 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.110
 I think it happened, he was 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.260
 going prasow if I'm not mistaken it 's the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.270
 The rest of the party back is me. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 thinking that two things can happen 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.710
 This they have managed to go there and there. 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.690
 the next landmark will roll in zoo 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.700
 or the angels were captured by the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.630
 the big morning gang and then the guys who're 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.120
 will have to rescue the angels and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.060
 no demerit is any character after all 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.480
 is facing her mother and her pack and 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.090
 clear old and the anj i think ufc 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 I already thought it would be kind of them 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.050
 I won the big blue I think it's a 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.910
 thing you need a lot of effort 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.610
 need to have something more centralized 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.290
 in history you see the power of 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.910
 characters in her flock do not pass the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.770
 played so a win against lyon 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.560
 told then I think he was caught 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.000
 he managed to flee but as he asks 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.730
 permission for the group to attack the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.800
 ship I think rolled an athlete and he went 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.350
 captured together with the other crew of the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.000
 Good old bunch guys, more or less. 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.330
 This I think I think he does not 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 go back pink and I would like it too 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.930
 to know your opinion will be much 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.209
 People are asking the questions, but I know. 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 that you have your theories here too 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.800
 it's not a debate, people make it clear 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.510
 a drunk on tel aviv both parties 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.060
 but it's really cool that we theorize 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.380
 also clear one thing as sure I 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.300
 I really like to hear your opinion 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.800
 you have to say and I would like to 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.820
 your opinion on all these 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.220
 factors 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.959
 you believe that the magnet is actually the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.750
 long sleeve think it has a great chance 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.060
 but I still have not mastered the old certainty 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.100
 I think it might be even another character 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.260
 All of a sudden, but I 'm betting on my 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.790
 chips in the middle brawl, that's it guys 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.610
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.790
 my thoughts on this confrontation or 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.760
 not that it could have happened there is between 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.410
 the angels and my sister's band and that's it 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760
 Who are you? Okay, well, I'm good with this. 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.760
