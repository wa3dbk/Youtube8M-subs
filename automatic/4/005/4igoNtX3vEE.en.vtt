00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
they were very informative and I think a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
they were very informative and I think a
lot<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> players<00:01:51.329> needed<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.979> like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
lot of players needed that or would like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.469
