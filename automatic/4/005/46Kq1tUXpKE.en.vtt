is<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.590> through<00:02:19.620> some<00:02:20.040> very<00:02:20.280> simple

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
is go through some very simple

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.309 
is go through some very simple
procedures<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.409> try<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.920> correct<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.480> mal

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
procedures to try to correct this mal

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.210 
procedures to try to correct this mal
position<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.000> head<00:02:27.209> being<00:02:27.569> held<00:02:27.840> back

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
position with the head being held back

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.430 
position with the head being held back
so<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.700> first<00:02:29.970> thing<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.299> must<00:02:30.840> take<00:02:30.959> place

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so the first thing that must take place

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
so the first thing that must take place
is<00:02:31.799> after<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.400> complete<00:02:32.879> your<00:02:33.090> physical

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
is after you complete your physical

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.100 
is after you complete your physical
examination<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:35.610> must<00:02:35.879> make<00:02:36.150> sure<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
examination is you must make sure that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.130 
examination is you must make sure that
you<00:02:37.530> relieve<00:02:37.920> pressure<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.420> calf<00:02:39.690> being

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you relieve pressure of the calf being

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.160 
you relieve pressure of the calf being
pushed<00:02:40.560> into<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.519> birth<00:02:41.700> canal<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.390> that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pushed into the birth canal and that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.890 
pushed into the birth canal and that
will<00:02:43.349> give<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> chance<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.489> actually

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
will give you a chance to actually

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.470 
will give you a chance to actually
assist<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.170> correcting<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> head<00:02:47.400> back<00:02:47.670> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
assist in correcting the head back so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390 
assist in correcting the head back so
the<00:02:48.930> first<00:02:49.200> thing<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.620> would<00:02:49.739> want<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.160> is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the first thing you would want to do is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.910 
the first thing you would want to do is
once<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.700> enter<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> birth<00:02:51.299> canal<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.959> repel

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
once you enter the birth canal is repel

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.809 
once you enter the birth canal is repel
the<00:02:53.160> calf<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:54.359> into<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.890> uterus<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.609> cow

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the calf back into the uterus of the cow

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.360 
the calf back into the uterus of the cow
so<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.690> would<00:02:57.989> push<00:02:58.379> back<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:59.609> the<00:03:00.209> calf<00:03:00.450> just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
so you would push back on the calf just

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.190 
so you would push back on the calf just
enough<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.670> give<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:03.870> more

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
enough to give you a little bit more

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.180 
enough to give you a little bit more
room<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.549> investigate<00:03:06.769> how<00:03:07.769> things

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
room so you can investigate how things

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.789 
room so you can investigate how things
are<00:03:08.690> where<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> position<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> calf's

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
are where the position of the calf's

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.069 
are where the position of the calf's
head<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.700> whether<00:03:12.359> or<00:03:12.480> not<00:03:12.569> you're<00:03:12.810> able

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
head is and whether or not you're able

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.460 
head is and whether or not you're able
to<00:03:13.109> correct<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:14.329> position<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.290> can

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
to correct this position so that you can

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.349 
to correct this position so that you can
deliver<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.950> calf<00:03:17.160> per<00:03:17.519> vagina

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
deliver the calf per vagina

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.699 
deliver the calf per vagina
so<00:03:19.109> once<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.769> calf<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.310> repelled<00:03:20.849> back<00:03:21.709> again

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
so once the calf is repelled back again

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.890 
so once the calf is repelled back again
you<00:03:22.859> probably<00:03:23.250> will<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:23.970> working<00:03:24.359> against<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
you probably will be working against the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
you probably will be working against the
cow<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.680> kind<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.069> have<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.280> work<00:03:26.609> with<00:03:26.819> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
cow so you kind of have to work with the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.970 
cow so you kind of have to work with the
cows<00:03:27.180> uterine<00:03:27.750> contractions<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.470> abdominal

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
cows uterine contractions and abdominal

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.379 
cows uterine contractions and abdominal
contractions<00:03:29.579> but<00:03:29.790> once<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.209> feel<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.349> have

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
contractions but once you feel you have

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.300 
contractions but once you feel you have
enough<00:03:33.389> room<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.200> make<00:03:34.349> an<00:03:34.500> assessment<00:03:35.099> as<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
enough room to make an assessment as to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.789 
enough room to make an assessment as to
what<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.700> problem<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.200> find<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
what the problem is you can find that

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.289 
what the problem is you can find that
this<00:03:38.579> calf<00:03:38.910> has<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.989> simple<00:03:40.650> head<00:03:40.950> back<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.910> I

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
this calf has a simple head back and I

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.780 
this calf has a simple head back and I
use<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.690> word<00:03:42.720> simple<00:03:43.349> lightly<00:03:43.859> because<00:03:44.220> this

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
use the word simple lightly because this

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.420 
use the word simple lightly because this
may<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.389> of<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.569> most<00:03:45.810> difficult

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
may be one of the most difficult

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.210 
may be one of the most difficult
dystocia<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.910> correct<00:03:48.359> in<00:03:49.349> order<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.799> correct

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
dystocia to correct in order to correct

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.449 
dystocia to correct in order to correct
this<00:03:50.370> dystocia<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.389> have<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.840> find<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:53.010> method

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
this dystocia you have to find a method

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.420 
this dystocia you have to find a method
by<00:03:53.639> which<00:03:53.669> to<00:03:54.239> bring<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.690> calf's<00:03:54.959> head<00:03:55.799> back

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
by which to bring the calf's head back

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.020 
by which to bring the calf's head back
into<00:03:57.030> alignment<00:03:57.530> between<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.769> front<00:03:59.040> legs<00:03:59.310> so

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
able to identify that and it may be very

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.550 
able to identify that and it may be very
difficult<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.850> correct<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.990> head<00:05:17.320> back

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
difficult to correct this head back

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.220 
difficult to correct this head back
without<00:05:17.860> identifying<00:05:18.700> one<00:05:19.510> or<00:05:19.630> two<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:20.020> those

positions

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
positions

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.230 
positions
I<00:05:21.280> mean<00:05:22.270> places<00:05:23.140> so<00:05:23.920> what<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.340> can<00:05:24.610> do<00:05:24.850> is<00:05:25.060> if

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
I mean places so what you can do is if

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.540 
I mean places so what you can do is if
the<00:05:25.390> calf<00:05:25.630> if<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.050> repel<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.590> calf<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:27.160> four

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
the calf if you repel the calf to four

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.570 
the calf if you repel the calf to four
what<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.330> can<00:05:28.600> do<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:28.960> actually<00:05:29.260> have<00:05:30.130> some

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
what you can do is actually have some

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.910 
what you can do is actually have some
assistance<00:05:31.270> maybe<00:05:31.750> pull<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.350> calf<00:05:32.590> just

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
assistance maybe pull the calf just

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.850 
assistance maybe pull the calf just
gently<00:05:33.760> a<00:05:34.000> little<00:05:34.510> bit<00:05:34.630> closer<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.590> by

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
gently a little bit closer to you by

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.920 
gently a little bit closer to you by
putting<00:05:36.100> tractions<00:05:36.820> on<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.240> lamp<00:05:37.420> traction

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
putting tractions on the lamp traction

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.990 
putting tractions on the lamp traction
on<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.140> limb<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.530> bringing<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.250> calf<00:05:39.490> closer

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
on the limb and bringing the calf closer

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.110 
on the limb and bringing the calf closer
to<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:40.750> then<00:05:41.350> what<00:05:41.560> you<00:05:41.680> can<00:05:41.860> do<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.370> work

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
to you and then what you can do is work

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
to you and then what you can do is work
again<00:05:43.600> as<00:05:43.900> it's<00:05:44.230> closer<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.130> identify

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
again as it's closer to you to identify

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.230 
again as it's closer to you to identify
the<00:05:47.140> Commish<00:05:47.560> or<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.160> calf's<00:05:48.430> mouth<00:05:48.850> and

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
the Commish or of the calf's mouth and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.630 
the Commish or of the calf's mouth and
once<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.080> identify<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.770> Commish<00:05:51.280> or<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
once you identify the Commish or of the

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.480 
once you identify the Commish or of the
calves<00:05:51.850> mouth<00:05:52.210> like<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.690> have<00:05:52.870> right<00:05:53.110> here<00:05:53.490> then

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
calves mouth like I have right here then

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.380 
calves mouth like I have right here then
what<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.120> can<00:05:55.330> do<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.840> actually<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:57.210> little<00:05:58.210> bit

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
what you can do is actually a little bit

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.000 
what you can do is actually a little bit
difficult<00:05:58.630> but<00:05:59.080> you're<00:05:59.230> gonna<00:05:59.350> have<00:05:59.560> to<00:05:59.710> push

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
difficult but you're gonna have to push

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.950 
difficult but you're gonna have to push
the<00:06:00.220> calf<00:06:00.430> back<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.790> little<00:06:01.060> bit<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.540> then

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
the calf back a little bit and then

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.540 
the calf back a little bit and then
change<00:06:02.470> places<00:06:02.980> with<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.760> calf<00:06:03.970> shoulder<00:06:04.690> and

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
change places with the calf shoulder and

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.180 
change places with the calf shoulder and
with<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:07.090> calf's<00:06:07.360> neck<00:06:07.840> and<00:06:08.080> head<00:06:08.950> and

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
with the calf's neck and head and

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.880 
with the calf's neck and head and
bringing<00:06:09.910> it<00:06:10.030> in<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.360> its<00:06:10.990> normal<00:06:11.680> position

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
bringing it in to its normal position

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.280 
bringing it in to its normal position
and<00:06:12.550> then<00:06:13.180> once<00:06:13.480> it's<00:06:13.690> in<00:06:13.810> its<00:06:13.990> normal

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
and then once it's in its normal

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.150 
and then once it's in its normal
position<00:06:14.970> then<00:06:15.970> you<00:06:16.240> can<00:06:16.450> actually<00:06:16.690> start<00:06:17.620> to

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
position then you can actually start to

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.820 
position then you can actually start to
advance<00:06:18.670> the<00:06:19.030> calf<00:06:19.270> back<00:06:19.690> into<00:06:20.380> its<00:06:20.620> normal

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
advance the calf back into its normal

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.150 
advance the calf back into its normal
present<00:06:21.730> position<00:06:22.570> and<00:06:22.930> posture<00:06:23.560> for

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
present position and posture for

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.320 
present position and posture for
complete<00:06:24.700> delivery<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:26.080> calf
