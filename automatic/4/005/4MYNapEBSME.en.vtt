00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
and just wipe around the iPod
or<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.570> decide<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.170> doesn't<00:02:16.410> matter<00:02:16.590> which

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
or so I decide it doesn't matter which

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.970 
or so I decide it doesn't matter which
way<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.960> preferably<00:02:18.960> try<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.680> wipe

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
way you do it preferably try and wipe

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.170 
way you do it preferably try and wipe
all<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:21.140> tissue<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.800> came<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.460> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
all the like tissue off that came on to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
all the like tissue off that came on to
the<00:02:24.360> iPod<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> looking<00:02:26.970> about<00:02:27.630> done

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the iPod and that is looking about done

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.470 
the iPod and that is looking about done
then<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.040> grab<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.280> tunnel<00:02:29.640> flannel<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
then you grab your tunnel flannel and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.940 
then you grab your tunnel flannel and
just<00:02:31.200> give<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.560> quick<00:02:32.990> brush<00:02:33.990> off<00:02:34.230> again

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
just give it a quick brush off again

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.340 
just give it a quick brush off again
because<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.580> flannels<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.420> flaky

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
because the flannels have little flaky

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.310 
because the flannels have little flaky
bits<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.130> sort<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:39.170> brushes<00:02:40.170> all

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
bits on so it sort of just brushes all

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.630 
bits on so it sort of just brushes all
the<00:02:40.500> bits<00:02:40.860> off<00:02:42.410> okay<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.250> front<00:02:44.490> is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.990

so yeah just go round to the nice
circular<00:04:21.570> motion<00:04:23.840> until<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.170> think<00:04:25.350> it's

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
circular motion until you think it's

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:34.180 
circular motion until you think it's
about<00:04:25.710> dry

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.570 

and<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:35.480> looks<00:04:35.810> about<00:04:36.050> done<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.740> if<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.400> just

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and that looks about done so if I just

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.670 
and that looks about done so if I just
turn<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:38.000> round<00:04:39.700> wipe<00:04:40.700> any<00:04:40.910> extra<00:04:41.680> excess

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
turn it round wipe any extra excess

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:51.450 
turn it round wipe any extra excess
tissue<00:04:43.250> paper<00:04:43.730> off<00:04:46.840> take<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.050> away<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:50.290> done

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
tissue paper off take that away and done

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.530 
tissue paper off take that away and done
so<00:04:52.460> yeah<00:04:52.760> that's<00:04:53.060> pretty<00:04:53.180> much<00:04:53.450> how<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.870> do<00:04:54.230> it

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
so yeah that's pretty much how you do it
