 happy because I know that after 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 try these recipes are going to feel 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.290
 much better from the Asian now we're going to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.240
 make a salmon salad with 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.279
 avocado that is a beauty knows 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 delicious the mix is well sing well 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.529
 to write down the ingredients of this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 recipe for this recipe we will use 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 four loins of fresh salmon a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.779
 ripe avocado only the pulp and the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.120
 cut into small cubes 10 and tomatoes 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.790
 cherry matches in the middle half 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.800
 chopped onion a lemon only the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 juice a cup of coriander leaves 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 chopped 2 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.290
 Salt and pepper to taste for mayonnaise 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.379
 We are going to use two ripe avocados 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.039
 only the pulp 6 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.540
 olive three lemons just the juice and salt and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.810
 Pepper 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.550
 to taste and this fascinates me inside the 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.890
 salmon I think it's a fish 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.309
 delicious and good we have the security 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 that is rich in omega and these omega 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
 they will be beneficial to eliminate the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.940
 blood cholesterol and I explain them 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 why when cholesterol enters and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.960
 sticks in the arteries the cholesterol does not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.770
 has the ability to get out of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.080
 arteries then you need an omega that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.660
 arrive and as a magnet or as a magnet 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 pulls the cholesterol from the arteries and it 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.040
 it takes it from the bloodstream and what 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.160
 out of the body through this because of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.950
 the intestines then you have to take 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.790
 Salmon yeah yeah yeah well let's 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.570
 salpimentar the salmon 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.370
 this on both sides 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.340
 whenever they want to see if a salmon 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.530
 it's cool you have to smell and touch a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.570
 little bit and if the salmon returns to its 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.350
 place and does not stay for torrado is for 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.350
 that the salmon is fresh 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.360
 let's put a little oil 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.460
 olive in a pan we're already here 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 preheating a little bit because I already 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 we have our our pretty fats 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.440
 here in the salmon then we are going to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.680
 place 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.660
 in the pan the salmon as it is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.220
 sending in or before because then not 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.740
 is properly 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.980
 let's sound to solar what on the other 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.890
 side today this sounds down 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.319
 and then I will move on now to follow a 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.140
 technique so that the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.510
 salmon cited good also what we're going to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.450
 do is we 're going to make a mix 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.480
 what is going to be the salad in this case I 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 I'm a fan of the entrance avocado because 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.549
 It is a Mexican product and to follow is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.599
 because it's rich in vitamin D I'm going 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.760
 to say where they will find the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.989
 vitamins see in all the foods that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.060
 be green or yellow or carry 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.579
 find all types of vitamin d 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.910
 and the intake we need a day is 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.859
 of 20 micrograms so you really do not 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.470
 it's a lot if we take a ration 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.299
 of vegetables a day we can be sure 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.120
 that we are fulfilling that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:15.849
 good intake we're going to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.849
 place the avocado here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.550
 we are also going to add the tomato that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.430
 Tomato, I 'm going to tell you apart from 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.140
 that has a very beta carotene 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.090
 pleasant and friendly for the organism 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.620
 This also removes cancer from 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.230
 possibilities of suffering in fact 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.260
 grape checks studies that showed 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.010
 that the intake of tomato decreases in 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.560
 39 percent the chances of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.920
 get cancer this is very important 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.260
 because here what should be integrated 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.360
 this tomato in our daily life and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.250
 that can help us a lot to improve 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.810
 our health and what happens with 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.790
 beta carotene how to eliminate 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.820
 free radicals or use with the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.610
 beta carotene and the Asian how to eliminate 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.140
 the free radicals of the body is 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.760
 removing the uric acid that is 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.760
 causing nerve inflammation 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 sciatica then it is important to consume 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.830
 this type of beta-carotene I'm going to flip 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.010
 my salmon that is already 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.680
 Check how nice is cool 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.630
 beautiful 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.000
 let's add then to our 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.300
 salad the cherry tomatoes that to me 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.590
 I love its flavor is a little sweeter 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.560
 that the tomato than the one that the tomatoes 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.610
 Italians well we are also going to add 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.099
 a little onion 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.009
 I tell them the live onion the onion this 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.199
 is for 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.569
 and give it a boost immune system 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.039
 and we're also going to add parsley 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.169
 parsley what is going to serve is to make 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.309
 well the digestion and that all the 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.410
 elements that we are 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:51.419
 ingesting 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.580
 have an optimal organic utility is 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.650
 to say that they really stand up and pass 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.080
 through the wall of the intestine and reach 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.270
 our system and we can have 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 in our body all the vitamins and 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.880
 the minerals that we need 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.249
 let's also add some juice 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.869
 of lemon 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.869
 some olive oil 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.290
 let's pepper 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.290
 all 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.270
 and we are going to mix and right now they are 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.120
 touching if you can eat this 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.240
 pulled apart 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.669
 set aside in the unit 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.370
 let's mix and this we're going to 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.370
 Reserve the lemon can also help 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.310
 that is not oxidized so fast the 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.520
 avocado what does not become black now 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.660
 let's go to the salmon if they notice it is already in 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.660
 the average term 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.040
 if you look at me you know here in the middle 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.860
 term is already sealed by both parties 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.930
 and now it's time to remove it and let 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.760
 the cooking will take its course but 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.290
 tranquilito then let's check out the 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.060
 fire to since it's on I'm going to 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.120
 put here 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.340
 and we will cover we will use a 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.270
 tapita so that then 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.710
 cook in a circle, not cook 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.820
 same everywhere also 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.750
 we put out the fire 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.520
 ok now let's make a one bed 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.400
 let's make an avocado mix 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.320
 let's put more avocado here 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.990
 he is alive the avocado really is very 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.449
 good many people say that it fattens and 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.319
 this not 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.050
 in time it's a truth we're going 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.090
 to crush a little 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.680
 and this avocado what we are going to do is 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.680
 that we are going to add lemon 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.819
 a little more we will add also 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.819
 olive oil 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:59.030
 and we also go to that area so that 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:03.500
 It is very rich and we are going to crush it 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.320
 this is going to make our bed 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.950
 saucer and they will see how rich you are going to 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.510
 stay at our presentation table and 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.520
 while I finish doing here my 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:18.190
 puree quoted from avocado let's cut 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.190
 but do not go more
