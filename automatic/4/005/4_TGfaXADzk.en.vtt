there's these two towers or actually
four<00:02:55.940> towers<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:57.170> overlook<00:02:57.620> all<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.890> gates

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
four towers that overlook all the gates

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.260 
tag people I think it's up to like maybe
here<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.459> don't<00:03:07.459> think<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.730> tack<00:03:08.150> the

here I don't think you can tack the
portal<00:03:08.600> from<00:03:08.690> up<00:03:08.810> here<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.470> all<00:03:09.709> you

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
portal from up here but you can all you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.460 
portal from up here but you can all you
can<00:03:10.190> attack<00:03:10.400> all<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.640> monsters<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:12.320> going

can attack all the monsters so I'm going

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.560 
can attack all the monsters so I'm going
to<00:03:12.500> go<00:03:12.620> back<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:16.000> I'm<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.209> go<00:03:17.330> a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
to get some hit points up and then the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.630 
to get some hit points up and then the
