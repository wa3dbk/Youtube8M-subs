piece<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> craft<00:02:35.430> sheath<00:02:35.989> why<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> piece

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
piece of craft sheath why is it a piece

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.120 
piece of craft sheath why is it a piece
of<00:02:37.560> craft<00:02:37.799> sheath

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.559 

because<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:45.020> we<00:02:45.110> go

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
because it is so here we go

00:02:46.569 --> 00:03:03.900 
because it is so here we go
this<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:49.780> where<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:51.020> can<00:02:51.080> see<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:52.330> much<00:02:53.330> better

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.560 

there<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.720> go<00:03:05.940> doesn't<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.090> look<00:03:07.330> a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
there you go doesn't that look a

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.310 
there you go doesn't that look a
thousand<00:03:08.230> times<00:03:08.620> better<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.200> it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
thousand times better it is and it's

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.140 
thousand times better it is and it's
definitely<00:03:11.710> easier<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> get<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:12.850> to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
definitely easier to get in and out to

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.860 
definitely easier to get in and out to
this<00:03:13.960> one<00:03:14.170> doesn't<00:03:14.350> really<00:03:14.970> snap<00:03:15.970> into<00:03:16.450> well<00:03:16.750> I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
this one doesn't really snap into well I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.150 
this one doesn't really snap into well I
guess<00:03:17.020> it<00:03:17.140> does<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.320> little<00:03:17.470> bit<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.890> here<00:03:18.070> at

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
guess it does a little bit up here at

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.070 
guess it does a little bit up here at
the<00:03:18.250> handle<00:03:18.460> but<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.300> most<00:03:19.480> codecs<00:03:19.990> that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
the handle but like most codecs that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.870 
the handle but like most codecs that
kind<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.380> snap<00:03:20.710> lock<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.190> place<00:03:23.220> these<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.670> of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
kind of snap lock in place these kind of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.850 
kind of snap lock in place these kind of
you<00:03:25.360> know<00:03:25.510> blades<00:03:26.320> are<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.830> easiest
