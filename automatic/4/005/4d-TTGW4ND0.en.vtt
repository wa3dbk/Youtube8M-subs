server<00:00:37.770> host<00:00:38.040> though<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.260> almost<00:00:40.710> been<00:00:40.980> up

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
server host though it's almost been up

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.270 
server host though it's almost been up
like<00:00:42.030> three<00:00:42.540> months<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
like three months and that's how long I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
like three months and that's how long I
paid<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.500> enough

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
paid for it to be up but we have enough

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
paid for it to be up but we have enough
money<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.270> renew<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.340> server<00:00:51.410> hosting<00:00:53.059> but<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
money to renew the server hosting but I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
money to renew the server hosting but I
don't<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.469> server<00:00:55.829> host<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
don't think this server host is that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.670 
don't think this server host is that
good<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.390> probably<00:00:57.629> gonna<00:00:58.020> change<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
good so I'm probably gonna change the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
good so I'm probably gonna change the
server<00:00:58.920> host<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.520> means<00:00:59.760> we're<00:01:00.570> going

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
server host and that means we're going

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
server host and that means we're going
to<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> new<00:01:01.320> IP<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.280> stay<00:01:02.579> tuned<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to use a new IP so stay tuned for that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
to use a new IP so stay tuned for that
on<00:01:03.539> our<00:01:03.600> thread<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.049> moment<00:01:07.159> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
can find the server IP in the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.149 
can find the server IP in the
description<00:01:14.869> some<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.009> would

like to say before I show the things
that's<00:01:19.320> been<00:01:19.619> built<00:01:19.950> recently<00:01:21.080> I'm<00:01:22.080> thinking

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that's been built recently I'm thinking

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
that's been built recently I'm thinking
of<00:01:22.740> buying<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.189> new<00:01:23.430> headset<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.240> will

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
of buying a new headset which will

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.499 
of buying a new headset which will
improve<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.409> microphone<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:28.640> also<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.909> might

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
improve the microphone and also i might

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.890 
improve the microphone and also i might
make<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.890> updates<00:01:32.340> videos<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.060> frequently

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
make more updates videos more frequently

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.170 
make more updates videos more frequently
but<00:01:34.170> i'm<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.439> gonna<00:01:34.619> promise<00:01:34.860> anything

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
but i'm not gonna promise anything

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.260 
but i'm not gonna promise anything
because<00:01:37.070> yeah<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because yeah i just don't think it's a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.569 
because yeah i just don't think it's a
good<00:01:39.299> idea<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> promise<00:01:41.720> Hogwarts<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> also

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
good idea to promise Hogwarts is also

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.590 
good idea to promise Hogwarts is also

really close to finishing it's probably

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.399 
really close to finishing it's probably
