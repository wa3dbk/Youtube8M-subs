 verification 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.080
 he will check if it really is 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.620
 errors takes a little bit little 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.890
 But you give it to me, it's not that much. 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.810
 it is not long after searching 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.910
 on the internet you can not find any 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 solution 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:33.760
 This is the one after a long time, right? 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.000
 my pen drives from here is stopped a four 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.980
 months I had bought the other only 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.340
 I got lost right? 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.769
 so I thought I 'll find a way 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.260
 try to at least get sp 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.510
 stop that a long time ago so I had 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.049
 this option from there 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.500
 As you have seen here in the video lesson 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.500

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.850
 He will arrive at the end there will be 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.370
 Just figure out just wait a little bit longer 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.280
 When you get there at the end, you 're not 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.570
 spending a long time there 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.000
 good is learning to apologize for video 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.720
 video, right? 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.110
 the next ones to leave will have a resolution 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:34.130
 better because I'm using it for my 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:37.790

 find a lot but almost all do not 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:57.770
 solve the complicated problem people 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:02.150
 search files but unfortunately 99% eu 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.620
 I do not solve our case a 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.650

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:52.240

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.210
 You who try to format there too 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.020

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.419
 unprotected 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:07.010
 let's format stay here in the initial a 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.120
 vote will erase all data from the 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.110
 disco 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.710

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.260
 things like here 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.350

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:47.040
 There is no song to copy this 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:50.070
 Music plays copying when it is 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.960
 protected and you can not copy 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.170
 It's my class video.
