and<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:10.139> kind<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> looking<00:00:10.980> at<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and I think just kind of looking at it

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860 
and I think just kind of looking at it
from<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.269> looks<00:00:12.420> like<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.750> on

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
from here it looks like this is on

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.240 
from here it looks like this is on
persona<00:00:13.170> actually<00:00:13.650> didn't<00:00:13.860> get<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.070> check

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
persona actually didn't get to check

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
persona actually didn't get to check
what<00:00:14.429> map<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.030> I'm<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.900> assume

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
what map this is on I'm going to assume

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
what map this is on I'm going to assume
it's<00:00:16.199> persona<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> map

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
it's persona just out of the map

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.590 
it's persona just out of the map
selection<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:17.940> think<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.210> fantasy

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
selection I don't think this is fantasy

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.010 
selection I don't think this is fantasy
too<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.980> might<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.310> Katrina<00:00:20.820> we'll<00:00:21.689> find<00:00:21.900> out

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
too it might be Katrina we'll find out

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.320 
too it might be Katrina we'll find out
in<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> few<00:00:22.170> seconds<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
in a few seconds here but if this is in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.670 
in a few seconds here but if this is in
fact<00:00:24.359> persona<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> lean

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
fact persona which I'm going to lean

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.170 
fact persona which I'm going to lean
towards<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.310> those<00:00:26.430> neutral<00:00:26.789> darts<00:00:27.000> form

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
towards there's those neutral darts form

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
towards there's those neutral darts form
all<00:00:27.359> across<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> map<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.920> kind<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
all across the map and that kind of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
all across the map and that kind of
makes<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> hard<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.609> Terran<00:00:29.910> players<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.929> if

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
makes it hard on Terran players but if

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.330 
makes it hard on Terran players but if
there<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> Terran<00:00:31.650> player<00:00:31.769> who<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.099> could

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
there was a Terran player who I could

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120 
there was a Terran player who I could
think<00:00:32.669> who<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.719> who<00:00:34.050> could<00:00:34.380> pull<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
think who I think who could pull out one

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.370 
think who I think who could pull out one
of<00:00:35.160> those<00:00:35.370> key<00:00:35.670> matchups<00:00:36.120> against<00:00:36.989> top<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of those key matchups against top of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
of those key matchups against top of
zerg<00:00:37.590> player<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.280> map<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:38.879> say<00:00:39.030> it's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
zerg player on this map I would say it's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
zerg player on this map I would say it's
probably<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.840> magic<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.379> measures<00:00:40.620> extremely

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
more than that he just adapts well and I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.950 
more than that he just adapts well and I
think<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.180> why<00:00:51.300> he's<00:00:51.420> done<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.809> well

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
deserves to be in the Final Four and I I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.590 
deserves to be in the Final Four and I I
definitely<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.880> he<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> good

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
definitely think he could make a good

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
definitely think he could make a good
run<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.710> Abby<00:01:08.549> superstore<00:01:09.180> Jaedong

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
run out of out Abby superstore Jaedong

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
run out of out Abby superstore Jaedong
unfortunately<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.740> he<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:11.100> manage

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
unfortunately I think if he does manage

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
unfortunately I think if he does manage
to<00:01:11.400> win<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.939> don't<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.600> could

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to win this I don't know that he could

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
to win this I don't know that he could
win<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> final<00:01:13.880> maybe<00:01:14.880> he<00:01:15.060> could<00:01:15.210> beat

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
win in the final maybe he could beat

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.149 
win in the final maybe he could beat
store<00:01:15.630> cuz<00:01:15.840> stores<00:01:16.080> vs<00:01:16.470> zerg<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.920> very

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
store cuz stores vs zerg is not very

initially thought he might try to cancel
it<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.219> magic<00:02:05.659> also<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:06.990> early<00:02:07.170> gasps<00:02:07.290> I

we've<00:02:12.330> seen<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.540> couple

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we've seen a couple

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.410 
we've seen a couple
I'm<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.370> sure<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.730> saw<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:14.940> before<00:02:15.090> from

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I'm not sure if I saw this before from

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.300 
I'm not sure if I saw this before from
up<00:02:15.570> magic<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.260> saw<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> before<00:02:16.830> I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
up magic but I know I saw this before I

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.730 
up magic but I know I saw this before I
think<00:02:18.090> light<00:02:18.330> attempted<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.710> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
think light attempted this and now a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.370 
think light attempted this and now a
second<00:02:20.670> expansion<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.330> down<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.780> basically

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
second expansion going down so basically

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.820 
second expansion going down so basically
interesting<00:02:23.220> sort<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.520> pseudo<00:02:24.150> 12<00:02:24.630> hatch<00:02:24.840> kind

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
interesting sort of pseudo 12 hatch kind

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.450 
interesting sort of pseudo 12 hatch kind
of<00:02:25.890> tech<00:02:26.160> build<00:02:26.430> coming<00:02:26.790> from<00:02:26.970> from<00:02:27.660> jaedong

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
of tech build coming from from jaedong

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.320 
of tech build coming from from jaedong
definitely<00:02:29.460> interesting<00:02:29.820> here<00:02:30.030> comes<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
definitely interesting here comes the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.350 
definitely interesting here comes the
scout<00:02:30.600> from<00:02:31.340> from<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.640> magic<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.060> we'll<00:02:33.150> see

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
scout from from up magic and we'll see

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
scout from from up magic and we'll see
how<00:02:33.510> he<00:02:33.570> kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.960> counters<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.770> really

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
how he kind of counters that and really

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
how he kind of counters that and really
I<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> good<00:02:35.730> map<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:37.050> magics

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
I think this is a good map on up magics

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.600 
I think this is a good map on up magics
part<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.100> good<00:02:38.280> map<00:02:38.460> to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
part I think this would be a good map to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.360 
part I think this would be a good map to
go<00:02:38.700> mech<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.620> factory<00:02:41.040> build<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
go mech and really to factory build is

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
go mech and really to factory build is
kind<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> standard<00:02:41.850> build<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.300> feel<00:02:42.510> like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
kind of the standard build I feel like

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.010 
kind of the standard build I feel like
most<00:02:43.260> player<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.920> least<00:02:44.250> vs<00:02:44.700> protoss<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.900> were

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
most player at least vs protoss you were

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.150 
most player at least vs protoss you were
forced<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.830> say<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
forced to and just as I say that a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.760 
forced to and just as I say that a
factory<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.790> fact<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.380> magic

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
factory is in fact going up for up magic

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.190 
factory is in fact going up for up magic
and<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.340> saw<00:02:50.550> shutter<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> very<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.960> good

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
kind of a mech type build we'll see how

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.450 
kind of a mech type build we'll see how
this<00:02:56.460> works<00:02:56.640> out<00:02:57.950> excuse<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.040> we'll<00:02:59.190> see<00:02:59.340> how

this works out for up magic and really

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.140 
this works out for up magic and really
you<00:03:01.950> need<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.580> need<00:03:02.730> vultures

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
you need that because you need vultures

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.760 
you need that because you need vultures
and<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.540> need<00:03:03.690> more<00:03:03.960> specifically<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> need

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
and you need more specifically you need

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.320 
and you need more specifically you need
mines<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.370> eventually<00:03:06.090> you're<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.270> to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
mines and eventually you're going to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
mines and eventually you're going to
need<00:03:06.480> tanks<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:07.320> kind<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.590> siege<00:03:07.800> mode

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
need tanks with kind of siege mode

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.110 
need tanks with kind of siege mode
anyway<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:08.670> definitely<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
anyway but it's definitely going to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.250 
anyway but it's definitely going to
create<00:03:09.330> an<00:03:09.420> interesting<00:03:09.810> matchup<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.200> it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
create an interesting matchup and it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.030 
create an interesting matchup and it
looks<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.730> fast<00:03:12.180> tech<00:03:13.040> from

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
looks like a really fast tech from

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.280 
looks like a really fast tech from
jaedong<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.580> he<00:03:15.000> has<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> lot<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.330> options<00:03:15.750> mech

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
jaedong and he has a lot of options mech

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.700 
jaedong and he has a lot of options mech
is<00:03:16.470> very<00:03:16.800> very<00:03:17.070> very<00:03:17.280> vulnerable<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.990> fast

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
is very very very vulnerable to a fast

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.860 
is very very very vulnerable to a fast

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
magic would see this kind of fast tech

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400 
magic would see this kind of fast tech
build<00:03:33.150> coming<00:03:33.510> he<00:03:33.660> would<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:33.990> able<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.200> fend

off that mute elastic tack in my opinion

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.960 
off that mute elastic tack in my opinion
as<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:37.980> see<00:03:38.130> zerglings<00:03:38.490> coming<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.820> now

as you can see zerglings coming out now

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.790 
as you can see zerglings coming out now
and<00:03:39.120> that's<00:03:39.270> that's<00:03:40.020> very<00:03:40.290> important<00:03:40.770> for

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
and that's that's very important for

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.500 
and that's that's very important for
Jaden<00:03:41.190> i<00:03:41.220> think<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.850> push<00:03:42.030> those<00:03:42.150> zerglings

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
Jaden i think is to push those zerglings

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.450 
Jaden i think is to push those zerglings
up<00:03:42.660> make<00:03:42.840> sure<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.260> second<00:03:43.740> expansion<00:03:43.980> doesn't

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
up make sure a second expansion doesn't

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.520 
up make sure a second expansion doesn't
go<00:03:44.550> up<00:03:44.670> make<00:03:44.820> sure<00:03:44.850> up<00:03:45.150> magic<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.930> playing<00:03:46.380> kind

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
go up make sure up magic is playing kind

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.950 
go up make sure up magic is playing kind
of<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.770> seal<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.750> great

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
of that seal and it this is really great

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.780 
of that seal and it this is really great
prediction<00:03:49.320> i<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:49.740> on<00:03:49.860> jade<00:03:50.100> on<00:03:50.220> realizing

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
prediction i think on jade on realizing

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.310 
prediction i think on jade on realizing
that<00:03:50.910> up<00:03:51.090> magic<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.570> kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.840> forced<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> go

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
that up magic is kind of forced to go

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.780 
that up magic is kind of forced to go
kind<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.680> basically<00:03:53.220> things<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.640> deal<00:03:53.760> with

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
kind of basically things to deal with

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.270 
kind of basically things to deal with
dark<00:03:54.120> swarm<00:03:54.360> which<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.630> siege<00:03:54.810> tanks<00:03:55.280> vultures

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
dark swarm which is siege tanks vultures

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.190 
dark swarm which is siege tanks vultures
with<00:03:56.520> mines<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.540> he's<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:58.140> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
with mines and so he's just going to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.300 
with mines and so he's just going to
counter<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.620> absolutely<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.250> to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
counter that absolutely going to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.980 
counter that absolutely going to
blitzkrieg<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.060> with<00:04:00.210> a<00:04:00.240> muta<00:04:00.600> lyst<00:04:00.780> build

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
blitzkrieg that with a muta lyst build

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.540 
blitzkrieg that with a muta lyst build
and<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:01.260> he<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.650> fact<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:01.950> melo's<00:04:02.280> that's

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
and if he is in fact going melo's that's

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.740 
and if he is in fact going melo's that's
just<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> don't<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:03.120> there's<00:04:03.300> anything<00:04:03.480> up

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
just I don't think there's anything up

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.630 
just I don't think there's anything up
magic<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.380> about<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.740> he's<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.490> get

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
magic do about it he's just going to get

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.760 
magic do about it he's just going to get
absolutely<00:04:06.150> overrun<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.080> fact<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> spire<00:04:07.560> is

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
absolutely overrun in fact the spire is

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.980 
absolutely overrun in fact the spire is
going<00:04:08.130> up<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.820> up<00:04:09.300> magic<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.660> don't<00:04:09.780> think<00:04:09.930> is

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
going up so up magic I don't think is

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.030 
going up so up magic I don't think is
going<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.290> anything<00:04:10.500> out<00:04:10.710> as<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.950> can

and really if I was jaedong just to be

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.300 
and really if I was jaedong just to be
sure<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.380> would<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.620> block<00:04:29.889> that<00:04:30.070> entire

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310

that dark swarm make sure that up magic
doesn't<00:04:34.780> get<00:04:34.960> out<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.260> base<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.620> as<00:04:36.580> you

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
doesn't get out of the base and as you

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.610 
doesn't get out of the base and as you
can<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.180> really<00:04:37.479> he<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.050> expand<00:04:38.410> at<00:04:38.500> this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
can and really he can expand at this

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.750 
can and really he can expand at this
point<00:04:38.830> doesn't<00:04:38.979> look<00:04:39.130> like<00:04:39.250> he's<00:04:39.400> going<00:04:39.580> to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
point doesn't look like he's going to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.189 
point doesn't look like he's going to
might<00:04:40.000> get<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.240> second<00:04:40.479> gastown<00:04:40.810> almost

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.290 
might get that second gastown almost
losing<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.650> Overlord<00:04:42.040> but<00:04:42.790> managed<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.180> get

losing that Overlord but managed to get

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.640 
losing that Overlord but managed to get
it<00:04:43.419> out<00:04:43.510> as<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.960> see<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.169> double<00:04:44.410> upgrade

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
it out as you can see the double upgrade

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.200 
it out as you can see the double upgrade
for<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.800> machine<00:04:45.100> shop<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.520> vultures<00:04:45.970> going

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
for the machine shop so vultures going

for the machine shop so vultures going
down<00:04:46.360> for<00:04:47.229> up<00:04:47.380> magic<00:04:47.740> but<00:04:47.919> again<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:49.000> just

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
down for up magic but again that just

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.490 
down for up magic but again that just
really<00:04:49.479> i<00:04:49.540> think<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.870> spells<00:04:50.139> is<00:04:50.290> doomed

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
really i think that spells is doomed

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.080 
really i think that spells is doomed
because<00:04:50.680> i<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:50.889> a<00:04:51.250> single<00:04:51.430> sunken<00:04:51.790> colony

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
because i think a single sunken colony

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.790 
because i think a single sunken colony
let's<00:04:52.240> see<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:52.449> jaedong<00:04:53.110> does<00:04:53.320> in<00:04:53.410> fact<00:04:53.440> put

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
let's see if jaedong does in fact put

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.710 
let's see if jaedong does in fact put
down<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.040> single<00:04:54.400> sunken<00:04:54.669> colony<00:04:55.030> anywhere<00:04:55.660> in

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
down a single sunken colony anywhere in

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.210 
down a single sunken colony anywhere in
the<00:04:55.780> area<00:04:55.930> that'll<00:04:56.320> basically<00:04:56.500> protect<00:04:57.070> his

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
the area that'll basically protect his

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.060 
the area that'll basically protect his
his<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> supply<00:04:58.389> because<00:04:59.229> vultures<00:04:59.620> not<00:04:59.800> very

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
his a supply because vultures not very

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.029 
his a supply because vultures not very
good<00:05:00.310> against<00:05:00.970> sunken<00:05:01.900> colonies<00:05:02.260> for<00:05:02.889> sure

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
good against sunken colonies for sure

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.670 
good against sunken colonies for sure
and<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.210> meantime<00:05:04.389> he's<00:05:05.229> going<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.590> have

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
and the meantime he's going to have

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680 
and the meantime he's going to have
anything<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.130> stop<00:05:06.340> air<00:05:06.610> i'm<00:05:07.150> not<00:05:07.300> sure<00:05:07.360> what

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690

he<00:05:07.810> was<00:05:07.840> expecting<00:05:08.139> maybe<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.590> three<00:05:09.010> hatch

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
he was expecting maybe a three hatch

he was expecting maybe a three hatch
build<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:11.320> pounding<00:05:11.770> music<00:05:11.889> sore<00:05:12.310> something

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
build and pounding music sore something

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.129

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.080 
but he doesn't have anything for anti
air<00:05:14.289> so<00:05:14.440> he's<00:05:14.620> really<00:05:14.830> kind<00:05:14.949> of<00:05:15.039> gone<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.250> all

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
air so he's really kind of gone in all

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.640 
air so he's really kind of gone in all
in<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.690> lot<00:05:16.780> of<00:05:16.840> zerglings<00:05:17.080> down<00:05:17.440> me

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
in here and a lot of zerglings down me

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.810 
in here and a lot of zerglings down me
time<00:05:17.830> looks<00:05:17.979> like<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.190> zerglings<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.699> going

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
time looks like the zerglings it going

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.279 
time looks like the zerglings it going
to<00:05:18.880> in<00:05:18.970> fact<00:05:19.150> be<00:05:19.300> blocking<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.720> ramp<00:05:19.900> those

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
to in fact be blocking the ramp those

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.390 
to in fact be blocking the ramp those
vultures<00:05:20.500> are<00:05:20.740> going<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.919> be<00:05:20.979> able<00:05:21.039> to<00:05:21.190> get<00:05:21.280> by

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400

vultures are going to be able to get by
without<00:05:21.520> mine<00:05:21.880> so<00:05:22.030> they<00:05:22.120> will<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.360> fact<00:05:22.479> have

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
without mine so they will in fact have

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.600 
without mine so they will in fact have
mines<00:05:23.020> but<00:05:23.229> the<00:05:23.289> question<00:05:23.560> is<00:05:23.650> is<00:05:23.860> will<00:05:24.490> be

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
mines but the question is is will be

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.950 
mines but the question is is will be
will<00:05:24.910> they<00:05:25.030> be<00:05:25.120> able<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.360> plant<00:05:25.539> them<00:05:25.690> anywhere

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
will they be able to plant them anywhere

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.930 
will they be able to plant them anywhere

bit of a miscue I think on Jaden's part
but<00:06:07.360> he<00:06:07.419> met<00:06:07.539> does<00:06:07.720> manage<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:07.990> rush<00:06:08.229> up<00:06:08.410> and

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.170 
easily could be taken out by that Sun
colony<00:06:48.070> so<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.250> do<00:06:48.370> believe<00:06:48.669> that<00:06:48.880> this<00:06:48.970> match

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
colony so I do believe that this match

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.870 
colony so I do believe that this match
is<00:06:49.360> firmly<00:06:49.830> in<00:06:50.830> j<00:06:51.130> dongs<00:06:51.310> hands<00:06:51.580> as<00:06:51.700> you<00:06:51.760> can

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
is firmly in j dongs hands as you can

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.340 
is firmly in j dongs hands as you can
see<00:06:52.000> just<00:06:52.030> camping<00:06:52.540> over<00:06:52.720> that<00:06:52.840> a<00:06:52.870> single<00:06:53.050> life

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
see just camping over that a single life

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.659 
see just camping over that a single life
looks<00:06:53.860> like<00:06:53.980> to<00:06:54.130> ghal<00:06:54.280> ice<00:06:54.340> have<00:06:54.580> been

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
looks like to ghal ice have been

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.340 
looks like to ghal ice have been
produced<00:06:54.970> actually<00:06:55.360> so<00:06:55.840> this<00:06:56.050> could<00:06:56.169> actually

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
produced actually so this could actually
