all right here is my 335 as you can see
I<00:00:07.529> need<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.130> redo<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.389> bought

I need to redo this here and I bought

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.879 
I need to redo this here and I bought
some<00:00:09.809> hoses<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:12.559> but<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.830> can

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
some hoses to to do that but as you can

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.330 
some hoses to to do that but as you can
see<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> line<00:00:14.370> comes<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.260> goes<00:00:16.260> down<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
see the line comes in goes down to the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.080 
see the line comes in goes down to the
actuator<00:00:18.859> comes<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.400> word<00:00:20.760> swear<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
actuator comes up in this word swear I

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.179 
actuator comes up in this word swear I
have<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.449> teed<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:23.150> my<00:00:26.060> vacuum<00:00:27.060> gauge<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
have it teed in for my vacuum gauge and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.790 
have it teed in for my vacuum gauge and
then<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> comes<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.140> then<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.289> tees<00:00:31.560> off

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
then it comes down and then at tees off

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
then it comes down and then at tees off
and<00:00:32.099> goes<00:00:32.250> into<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> actuator<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.989> goes

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and goes into the actuator and then goes

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
and goes into the actuator and then goes
on<00:00:34.550> let<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.579> grab<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:35.969> laptop<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.700> I'll

I'll<00:02:03.020> give<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.229> some<00:02:03.500> throttle<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:07.539> push<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
I'll give it some throttle I push it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.170 
I'll give it some throttle I push it
slow<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.440> down<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:12.220> don't<00:02:13.220> really<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.760> much<00:02:13.970> of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
slow and down I don't really get much of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.890 
slow and down I don't really get much of
a<00:02:14.209> response

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:29.180 

if<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.349> quickly<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.390> get

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.339 

I'll<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.430> slow<00:02:30.760> again<00:02:30.879> I<00:02:33.900> hope<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.049> have<00:02:35.200> this

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
I'll do it slow again I hope I have this

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.550 
I'll do it slow again I hope I have this
hooked<00:02:35.590> up<00:02:35.739> correctly<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:37.690> had<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.319> act

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
hooked up correctly I have had this act

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
hooked up correctly I have had this act
a<00:02:38.680> little<00:02:38.799> differently<00:02:39.280> but<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.879> think<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.510> might

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
a little differently but I think I might

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.390 
a little differently but I think I might
have<00:02:40.840> pitched<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.349> whole<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.860> holes<00:02:42.099> in<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
have pitched the whole the holes in the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
have pitched the whole the holes in the
blood<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.540> hood<00:02:43.720> up

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
blood but right now I have the hood up

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.350 
blood but right now I have the hood up
there<00:02:44.920> shouldn't<00:02:45.190> be<00:02:45.250> anything<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.150> line

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
there shouldn't be anything to the line

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.730 
there shouldn't be anything to the line
so<00:02:46.890> hopeless<00:02:47.890> house<00:02:48.069> Thanks
