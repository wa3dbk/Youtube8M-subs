this segment we're gonna talk again

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.910 
this segment we're gonna talk again
about<00:00:23.390> line-of-sight<00:00:24.390> TTL<00:00:25.080> transmission<00:00:25.769> at

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
about line-of-sight TTL transmission at

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.269 
about line-of-sight TTL transmission at
a<00:00:26.160> distance<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> also<00:00:27.510> using<00:00:28.019> color<00:00:28.260> gels<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
a distance and also using color gels to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.730 
a distance and also using color gels to
alter<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:29.820> match<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.900> color<00:00:31.140> environment

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
alter or match the color environment

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.479 
alter or match the color environment
you're<00:00:31.859> shooting<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you're shooting it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
you're shooting it
I<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.239> shuttered<00:00:33.690> shops<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I like these shuttered shops there's a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.880 
I like these shuttered shops there's a
strong<00:00:35.190> graphic<00:00:35.820> line<00:00:36.170> okay<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.739> also

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
strong graphic line okay and I also

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.410 
strong graphic line okay and I also
picked<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> fact<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.239> some

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
picked up on the fact that there's some

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.830 
picked up on the fact that there's some
red<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> glint<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.579> ISO<00:00:42.030> 200<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
red kind of glint so at ISO 200 which is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
red kind of glint so at ISO 200 which is
good<00:00:43.410> ISO<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> stay<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> really

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
good ISO to stay at because it really

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.350 
good ISO to stay at because it really
means<00:00:45.360> quality<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.899> detail<00:00:46.050> I've<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> 30th

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
means quality and detail I've got a 30th

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
means quality and detail I've got a 30th
roughly<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.989> F<00:00:49.230> 2.8<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> glimmer<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
roughly at F 2.8 and just a glimmer of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.000 
roughly at F 2.8 and just a glimmer of
red<00:00:51.570> off<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.489> shuttered<00:00:54.329> shops

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
red off of all of these shuttered shops

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
red off of all of these shuttered shops
so<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> maintain<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.420> shutter<00:00:57.690> speed

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so how do I maintain that shutter speed

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.889 
so how do I maintain that shutter speed
and<00:00:58.140> augment<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> red<00:00:59.430> well<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.629> use

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and augment the red well I'm gonna use

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
and augment the red well I'm gonna use
angle<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> incidence<00:01:01.980> angle<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> reflection

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
angle of incidence angle of reflection

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.469 
angle of incidence angle of reflection
I'm<00:01:03.510> gonna<00:01:03.989> take<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> TTL<00:01:04.860> flash<00:01:05.240> it'll<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.330> my

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I'm gonna take a TTL flash it'll be my

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'm gonna take a TTL flash it'll be my
background<00:01:06.750> light<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> it'll<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.799> Group<00:01:08.040> C

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
background light so it'll be in Group C

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
background light so it'll be in Group C
I'm<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.840> flash<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> see

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I'm gonna put this flash as you see

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
I'm gonna put this flash as you see
there's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> red<00:01:11.729> gel<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> I've<00:01:13.290> also

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
there's a red gel on it and I've also

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.640 
there's a red gel on it and I've also
sealed<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.490> gel<00:01:14.760> over<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> flash<00:01:16.080> head<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.560> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
sealed the gel over the flash head so in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
sealed the gel over the flash head so in
other<00:01:16.770> words<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.460> no<00:01:17.549> white<00:01:18.150> light

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
other words there's no white light

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870 
other words there's no white light
bleeding<00:01:18.900> around<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:20.100> red<00:01:20.430> coming

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
bleeding around it it's all red coming

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
bleeding around it it's all red coming
out<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.710> down

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
out of here so I'm gonna put this down

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
out of here so I'm gonna put this down
the<00:01:23.159> block<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> try<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> make<00:01:24.479> sure<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the block and try to make sure that it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
the block and try to make sure that it
has<00:01:25.140> great<00:01:25.380> efficiency<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.400> matching<00:01:26.700> angle

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
has great efficiency by matching angle

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
has great efficiency by matching angle
of<00:01:27.600> incidence<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> angular<00:01:28.500> reflection<00:01:29.159> right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
of incidence to angular reflection right

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
of incidence to angular reflection right
into<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.329> camera<00:01:30.600> lens<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> other<00:01:31.799> words

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
into my camera lens so in other words

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
into my camera lens so in other words
this<00:01:32.790> light<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> block<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this light will be down the block and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
this light will be down the block and
it'll<00:01:35.100> hit<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> storefront<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> skip

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it'll hit the storefront and skip

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
it'll hit the storefront and skip
literally<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> lens<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
literally right into the lens of the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
literally right into the lens of the
camera<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.840> should<00:01:40.079> take<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.740> minimal

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
camera and it should take this minimal

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
camera and it should take this minimal
red<00:01:41.520> glow<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.420> seeing<00:01:42.750> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
red glow that I'm seeing that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
red glow that I'm seeing that's
inspiring<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> use<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.820> particular

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
inspiring the use of this particular

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600 
inspiring the use of this particular
location<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.619> augment<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.430> with

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
location and really augment it with

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.660 
location and really augment it with
artificial<00:01:48.600> flashlights<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.340> means<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
artificial flashlights so that means I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
artificial flashlights so that means I
don't<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> drag<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.899> shutter<00:01:52.200> or

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
don't have to drag my shutter or

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
don't have to drag my shutter or
lengthen<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.159> shutter<00:01:53.520> speed<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
lengthen my shutter speed out to kind of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
lengthen my shutter speed out to kind of
get<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> ambient<00:01:55.860> light<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.790> I'm

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
get the ambient light because then I'm

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
get the ambient light because then I'm
going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> situation<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:58.560> it'd

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
going to get into a situation where it'd

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.459 
going to get into a situation where it'd
be<00:01:58.799> tough<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.219> handhold<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.939> also<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.200> model

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
be tough to handhold and also the model

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.740 
be tough to handhold and also the model
may<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:02.159> sharp<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.450> shutter

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
may not be sharp because the shutter

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.649 
may not be sharp because the shutter
speed<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.770> lengthy<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:06.149> what's<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
speed is so lengthy so what's the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.440 
speed is so lengthy so what's the
problem<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> enemy<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.300> you're

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
problem or the enemy really when you're

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.360 
problem or the enemy really when you're
trying<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> create<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.319> saturated<00:02:11.039> color

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
trying to create a saturated color

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.420 
trying to create a saturated color
environment<00:02:12.260> lots<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.590> lots<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:14.010> white

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430

light<00:02:14.549> bouncing<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.209> over<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.450> place<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
light bouncing all over the place this

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.179 
light bouncing all over the place this
is<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.829> great<00:02:17.159> flash<00:02:17.780> light<00:02:18.780> shaper<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:19.950> what's

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
is a great flash light shaper but what's

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.030 
is a great flash light shaper but what's
the<00:02:20.430> situation<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.959> big<00:02:22.260> expanse<00:02:22.799> of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the situation here it's a big expanse of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
the situation here it's a big expanse of
white<00:02:23.280> area<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.359> flash<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.870> coming

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
white area that the flash is coming

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
white area that the flash is coming
through<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.549> spreading<00:02:26.969> all<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
through and it's spreading all over the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660 
through and it's spreading all over the
place<00:02:27.719> and<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.319> mitigating<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> effect<00:02:29.489> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
place and it's mitigating the effect of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.240 
place and it's mitigating the effect of
the<00:02:29.849> red<00:02:30.109> environment<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.290> red<00:02:31.530> gel<00:02:31.889> that<00:02:32.129> I'm

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the red environment the red gel that I'm

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.640 
the red environment the red gel that I'm
trying<00:02:32.609> to<00:02:32.700> create<00:02:32.969> so<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:34.079> I'm<00:02:34.170> gonna<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
trying to create so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
trying to create so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:34.769> going<00:02:34.889> to<00:02:34.950> use<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.519> very<00:02:35.969> simple<00:02:36.239> thing

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I'm going to use a very simple thing

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.839 
I'm going to use a very simple thing
called<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.109> fabric<00:02:37.739> grid<00:02:38.389> this<00:02:39.389> will<00:02:39.659> velcro

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
called a fabric grid this will velcro

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.119 
called a fabric grid this will velcro
right<00:02:41.849> into<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.840> front<00:02:43.139> of<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.560> light<00:02:43.739> shaper

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
right into the front of the light shaper

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.940 
right into the front of the light shaper
and<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.639> it<00:02:44.730> does<00:02:44.969> is<00:02:45.329> it<00:02:46.170> column<00:02:46.590> lates<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and what it does is it column lates the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.220 
and what it does is it column lates the
light<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.760> takes<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.299> just<00:02:48.569> like<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> honeycomb

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
light it takes it just like a honeycomb

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530 
light it takes it just like a honeycomb
grid<00:02:49.590> would<00:02:50.159> on<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> smaller<00:02:50.909> light<00:02:51.239> source

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
grid would on a smaller light source

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.500 
grid would on a smaller light source
these<00:02:52.139> fabric<00:02:52.739> grids<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.189> drop<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.700> over

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
these fabric grids will drop in over

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
these fabric grids will drop in over
softboxes<00:02:55.200> both<00:02:55.650> big<00:02:55.919> and<00:02:55.950> small<00:02:56.159> soft<00:02:56.639> boxes

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
softboxes both big and small soft boxes

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.390 
softboxes both big and small soft boxes
and<00:02:57.239> take<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.139> light<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.560> shape<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and take the light and shape it and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.860 
and take the light and shape it and
control<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.359> doesn't<00:03:00.540> spill

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
control it so it doesn't spill

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.959 
control it so it doesn't spill
everywhere<00:03:01.169> so<00:03:01.889> this<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> means<00:03:02.669> I'm

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
everywhere so this is the means I'm

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.569 
everywhere so this is the means I'm
going<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.329> use<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:04.560> make<00:03:04.739> sure<00:03:04.919> my<00:03:05.099> white<00:03:05.340> light

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
going to use to make sure my white light

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.940 
going to use to make sure my white light
doesn't<00:03:06.180> interfere<00:03:06.569> with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.500> red<00:03:07.709> light

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
doesn't interfere with the red light

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.009 
doesn't interfere with the red light
that<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:08.400> trying<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> create<00:03:09.090> for<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
that I'm trying to create for the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.170 
that I'm trying to create for the
environment<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.799> picture<00:03:11.129> so<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
environment of the picture so I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.089 
environment of the picture so I
positioned<00:03:12.719> my<00:03:12.840> red<00:03:13.079> light<00:03:13.290> down<00:03:13.469> the<00:03:13.680> block

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
positioned my red light down the block

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.949 
positioned my red light down the block
I've<00:03:14.370> tucked<00:03:14.669> it<00:03:14.849> up<00:03:14.969> against<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.480> telephone

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
I've tucked it up against a telephone

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.659 
I've tucked it up against a telephone
pole<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.650> kind<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.919> out<00:03:17.069> of<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.280> way<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
pole so it's kind of out of the way and

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.309 
pole so it's kind of out of the way and
doesn't<00:03:18.239> obstruct<00:03:18.449> pedestrian<00:03:19.109> traffic

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
doesn't obstruct pedestrian traffic

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.729 
doesn't obstruct pedestrian traffic
always<00:03:20.040> important<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.669> also<00:03:21.540> mentioned<00:03:22.139> that

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
always important I also mentioned that

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.530 
always important I also mentioned that
it<00:03:23.159> was<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> be<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.609> group<00:03:23.849> C<00:03:24.060> light<00:03:24.299> and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
it was going to be a group C light and

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.240 
it was going to be a group C light and
that's<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.199> way<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.319> usually<00:03:25.620> work<00:03:26.010> my

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
that's the way I usually work my

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.219 
that's the way I usually work my
background<00:03:26.849> lights<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.269> always<00:03:27.479> my<00:03:27.780> group<00:03:27.989> C

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
background lights are always my group C

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.439 
background lights are always my group C
light<00:03:28.409> but<00:03:29.159> I'm<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.639> try<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:29.939> do<00:03:30.239> this

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
light but I'm going to try to do this

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.960 
light but I'm going to try to do this
particular<00:03:30.840> set<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:31.439> you<00:03:32.010> can<00:03:32.189> see<00:03:32.400> or<00:03:32.699> you

particular set up you can see or you
will<00:03:33.239> see<00:03:33.449> in<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.659> shot<00:03:33.870> how<00:03:34.109> far<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.560> light

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
will see in the shot how far that light

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.050 
will see in the shot how far that light
is<00:03:34.889> away<00:03:35.129> but<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.549> try<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.790> work

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
is away but I'm going to try to work

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.719 
is away but I'm going to try to work
with<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.780> pop-up<00:03:37.290> or<00:03:37.500> built-in<00:03:38.129> flash<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.699> a

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
with the pop-up or built-in flash on a

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.240 
with the pop-up or built-in flash on a
d800<00:03:39.419> which<00:03:39.810> means<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.439> light<00:03:40.739> now<00:03:40.979> is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
d800 which means that that light now is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.309 
d800 which means that that light now is
my<00:03:41.609> background<00:03:42.090> light<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.629> cannot<00:03:42.989> put<00:03:43.229> it
