about an island like a hidden island

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.400 
about an island like a hidden island
somewhere<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.400> lake<00:00:29.640> evo<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.930> supposed<00:00:31.170> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700 

now<00:01:41.530> we're<00:01:41.710> gonna<00:01:41.830> do<00:01:42.510> saddle<00:01:43.510> roast<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:44.560> we're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
now we're gonna do saddle roast so we're

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.530 
now we're gonna do saddle roast so we're
gonna<00:01:44.860> try<00:01:45.400> out<00:01:45.640> some<00:01:46.170> some<00:01:47.170> roasting<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.420> the

gonna try out some some roasting so the
reason<00:01:49.720> we're<00:01:50.110> doing<00:01:50.230> this<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.730> actually<00:01:51.730> to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
reason we're doing this is actually to

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.760 
reason we're doing this is actually to
get<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.940> reference<00:01:52.210> point<00:01:52.510> where<00:01:53.170> if<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.440> know

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
get a reference point where if we know

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.550 
get a reference point where if we know
how<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.490> taste<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:55.210> roster<00:01:55.780> then<00:01:56.440> we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
how this will taste this roster then we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.750 
how this will taste this roster then we
have<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> good<00:01:56.890> reference<00:01:57.100> for<00:01:57.370> when<00:01:57.640> you're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
have a good reference for when you're

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
have a good reference for when you're
roasting<00:01:58.080> later<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> same<00:01:59.890> register

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.320 

it's<00:02:17.680> time<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> really<00:02:18.910> good<00:02:19.060> cup<00:02:19.300> of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it's time for a really good cup of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.870 
it's time for a really good cup of
coffee

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.340 

I'm<00:02:25.880> very<00:02:26.090> satisfied<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> good

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
I'm very satisfied this is a good

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.450 
I'm very satisfied this is a good
calibration<00:02:28.240> it's<00:02:29.240> lighter<00:02:29.660> than<00:02:30.460> expected

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
calibration it's lighter than expected

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.370 
calibration it's lighter than expected
so<00:02:32.030> we<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.300> boost<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.840> till<00:02:33.020> next<00:02:33.230> time

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
so we just boost it up till next time

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.580 
so we just boost it up till next time
this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.460> perfect<00:02:34.880> look<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:35.930> calibrated

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
this is perfect look we just calibrated

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.050 
this is perfect look we just calibrated
