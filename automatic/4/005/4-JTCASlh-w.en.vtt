you're going to be using right from the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.290 
you're going to be using right from the
start<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.650> hopefully<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:21.000> over<00:00:21.210> on

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300

this green section here we'll just

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.450 
this green section here we'll just
magically<00:00:23.730> appear<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.829> and<00:00:25.829> let's<00:00:26.279> say

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.710 
chord so the thing is that you need to
be<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> kind<00:00:31.079> of<00:00:31.140> aware<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.950> of<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
be a kind of aware of first of all the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.970 
be a kind of aware of first of all the
vertical<00:00:33.720> lines<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.320> one's<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.710> happen

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
vertical lines the one's going to happen

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910 
vertical lines the one's going to happen
down<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> way<00:00:35.570> represent<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.930> six<00:00:37.290> strings

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
down this way represent the six strings

down this way represent the six strings
and<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:41.130> hand<00:00:41.430> side<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and the one on the right hand side is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.830 
and the one on the right hand side is
the<00:00:42.960> thickest<00:00:43.530> string<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.270> the

the thickest string and the one on the
left<00:00:46.050> hand<00:00:46.320> side<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> thinnest<00:00:47.910> string

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
left hand side is the thinnest string

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.440 
left hand side is the thinnest string
now<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> lines<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.400> horizontally<00:00:51.150> by

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
now the lines going horizontally by

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.010 
now the lines going horizontally by
along<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.790> these<00:00:53.790> are<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.210> frets<00:00:54.720> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
along this way these are the frets and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.250 
along this way these are the frets and
the<00:00:55.890> two<00:00:56.160> two<00:00:56.820> lines<00:00:57.150> at<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> top<00:00:57.540> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the two two lines at the top that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.140 
the two two lines at the top that
represents<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> nut<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.820> talked<00:01:00.030> about

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
represents the nut which we talked about

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.880 
represents the nut which we talked about
earlier<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> plastic<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.290> metal<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.770> at

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
earlier is the plastic or metal thing at

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
earlier is the plastic or metal thing at
the<00:01:01.980> top<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.400> guitar<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.720> really

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the top of the guitar so it's really

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.179 
the top of the guitar so it's really
important<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.619> familiar<00:01:04.799> with

we<00:02:52.920> need<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.099> check<00:02:53.340> out<00:02:53.519> his<00:02:53.640> tab<00:02:53.970> which<00:02:54.540> we're

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
we need to check out his tab which we're

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.910 
we need to check out his tab which we're
not<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.959> be<00:02:55.080> using<00:02:55.410> straight<00:02:55.650> away<00:02:55.860> but

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
not going to be using straight away but

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.380 
not going to be using straight away but
it's<00:02:56.190> important<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.790> understand<00:02:57.239> what

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it's important that you understand what

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.809 
it's important that you understand what
the<00:02:57.510> idea<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:58.920> end<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.130> with<00:02:59.340> six

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the idea of it is so we end up with six

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.490 
the idea of it is so we end up with six
lines<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.420> tab<00:03:00.569> if<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:00.989> some<00:03:01.170> two<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.349> here

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500

here<00:03:02.390> okay<00:03:03.390> there's<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> little<00:03:03.989> bit<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.140> tab

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440

that you can write on tab but for now
you<00:03:31.410> only<00:03:31.709> need<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.250> understand<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you only need to really understand the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.080 
you only need to really understand the
basics<00:03:33.239> which<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.549> lowest<00:03:35.549> line<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.940> the

basics which is the lowest line is the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.809 
basics which is the lowest line is the
thickest<00:03:36.420> string<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.769> top<00:03:38.190> line<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
thickest string but the the top line is

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.150 
thickest string but the the top line is
the<00:03:38.880> thinnest<00:03:39.450> string<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.170> numbers<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.859> the

the thinnest string the numbers on the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.250 
the thinnest string the numbers on the
line<00:03:41.370> represent<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> fret<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.810> you'd<00:03:42.989> put<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
line represent the fret that you'd put a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.720 
line represent the fret that you'd put a
finger<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> doesn't<00:03:44.400> tell<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.700> what

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that you'd play it at the same time so

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.140 
that you'd play it at the same time so
if<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:18.959> looked<00:04:19.200> at<00:04:19.320> say<00:04:19.530> an<00:04:19.739> E<00:04:20.280> chord<00:04:20.310> you'd

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
if you looked at say an E chord you'd

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.839 
if you looked at say an E chord you'd
see<00:04:21.389> all<00:04:21.599> up<00:04:22.019> above<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.530> each<00:04:23.039> other<00:04:23.310> would<00:04:23.820> be

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
see all up above and each other would be

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.990 
see all up above and each other would be
from<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.660> thinnest<00:04:24.990> string<00:04:25.080> would<00:04:25.680> be<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.889> 0<00:04:26.490> 0

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
from the thinnest string would be a 0 0

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.440 
from the thinnest string would be a 0 0
1<00:04:27.539> 2<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.500> 0<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.700> would<00:04:29.849> be<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> same<00:04:30.300> as

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
1 2 to 0 and that would be the same as

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.210 
1 2 to 0 and that would be the same as
playing<00:04:30.690> an<00:04:30.810> open<00:04:31.020> E<00:04:31.440> chord<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:31.979> we're<00:04:32.099> going
