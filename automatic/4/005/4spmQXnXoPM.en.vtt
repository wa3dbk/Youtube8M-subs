 very well and then I left the bank and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.580
 I decided to throw myself into the world 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.039
 let's say officially with the bakery and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.039

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.869
 chocolate butter we will put in 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.869
 march the blender to make crumbs 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840
 once we've made crumbs with 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 our cake 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280
 let's add the amount of cream 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.079
 necessary this is not a recipe is of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.530
 everything depends on the consistency depends 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.729
 of the juiciness of the sponge cake and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.210
 consistency of our cream 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.210
 Butter 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.010
 this is already to its perfect consistency 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.970
 let's check it we take a piece 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.250
 and we can start making some balls 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.830
 we have to get a texture like 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.360
 a good thick truffle we already have all 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.640
 our balls are going to leave them 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 in the fridge 15 minutes half an hour and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.130
 melted white chocolate 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.260
 we have melted little by little 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 microwaves and I had them a pink color 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.000
 pale with specific coloring of 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.550
 chocolate now what we are going to do is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.340
 click on the lollipop stick in each 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.370
 of the balls 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 has gone from our lollipops a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 little time in the fridge about 15 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.069
 minutes then now let's move on to 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.629
 to bathe the chocolate we have given 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.180
 another little bit of heat to keep it going 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.060
 melted chocolate let's put it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.660
 upside down and drain the excess we go to 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.940
 flip the hand and not the stick 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.060
 and now we can decorate directly with 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.220
 the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.770
 a sprint is a few balls of color 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.440
 what we like 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.260
 the easiest thing is to turn the lollipop 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 while we throw away the decoration that we have 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.680
 chosen one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.890
 and we put it face up to dry 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.360
 and this we are going to arrive for example 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 little flowers 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.230

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.100
 generously how do you make a good 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.250

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.900

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.120

 previous work to start business 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.020
