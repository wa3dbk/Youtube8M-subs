00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 

okay<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.390> they're<00:00:45.660> both<00:00:45.809> pre-loaded<00:00:46.320> we're

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
okay so they're both pre-loaded we're

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.690 
okay so they're both pre-loaded we're
going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.649> over<00:00:46.800> Wi-Fi<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.370> we'll<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.430 

so<00:00:56.539> iphone<00:00:57.530> 4s<00:00:57.980> jumped<00:00:58.640> out<00:00:58.789> beat<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.989> iphone

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
so iphone 4s jumped out beat the iphone

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.030 
so iphone 4s jumped out beat the iphone
4<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:01.309> be<00:01:01.370> expected<00:01:02.230> let's<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.559> same<00:01:03.769> thing

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
4 to be expected let's do the same thing

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.969 
4 to be expected let's do the same thing
let's<00:01:04.970> turn<00:01:05.210> both<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.509> their<00:01:05.869> wifis<00:01:06.740> off<00:01:09.310> ok

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
let's turn both of their wifis off ok

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.530 
let's turn both of their wifis off ok
and<00:01:12.979> let's<00:01:13.040> do<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:14.180> both<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.930> yahoo<00:01:16.540> you

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
and let's do on both to yahoo you

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.590 
and let's do on both to yahoo you
actually<00:01:17.750> get<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:17.899> nice<00:01:18.110> speed<00:01:18.380> test<00:01:18.619> here<00:01:19.600> so

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
actually get a nice speed test here so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.359 
actually get a nice speed test here so
these<00:01:20.659> are<00:01:20.780> both<00:01:20.990> over<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.440> 3g<00:01:21.680> networks<00:01:22.130> of

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
these are both over the 3g networks of

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.520 
these are both over the 3g networks of
sprint<00:01:22.789> and<00:01:23.530> AT&amp;T<00:01:24.530> AT&amp;T<00:01:25.490> really<00:01:26.299> burned<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
sprint and AT&amp;T AT&amp;T really burned the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.380 
sprint and AT&amp;T AT&amp;T really burned the
sprint<00:01:27.890> network<00:01:27.950> there<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:28.970> that's<00:01:29.030> already

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
sprint network there so that's already

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.810 
sprint network there so that's already
loaded<00:01:29.780> sprint<00:01:30.619> still<00:01:31.190> taking<00:01:31.429> a<00:01:31.460> few<00:01:31.640> minutes

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
loaded sprint still taking a few minutes

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.600 
loaded sprint still taking a few minutes
seconds<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.909> still<00:01:37.909> loading<00:01:38.270> something<00:01:38.450> here

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
seconds and still loading something here

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.830 
seconds and still loading something here
and<00:01:41.289> finally<00:01:42.289> so<00:01:42.560> ATT<00:01:43.399> net<00:01:43.460> network<00:01:44.090> both<00:01:44.659> of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and finally so ATT net network both of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.290 
and finally so ATT net network both of
these<00:01:44.929> are<00:01:45.140> at<00:01:45.259> three<00:01:45.740> bars<00:01:46.009> if<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.670> can't<00:01:46.909> see

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
these are at three bars if you can't see

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.149 
these are at three bars if you can't see
that<00:01:47.509> I<00:01:49.929> think<00:01:50.929> this<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.319> little<00:01:51.560> too<00:01:51.649> bright

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
that I think this is a little too bright

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.190 
that I think this is a little too bright
so<00:01:52.940> let<00:01:53.090> me<00:01:53.179> turn<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.420> down<00:01:53.690> so<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:53.929> can<00:01:54.020> see

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
so let me turn that down so you can see

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.350 
so let me turn that down so you can see
it<00:01:54.289> better

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.970 

but<00:02:00.020> both<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.320> them<00:02:00.650> are<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:01.820> three<00:02:02.360> bars<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.560> 18

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
but both of them are at three bars so 18

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.210 
but both of them are at three bars so 18
t3g<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.090> phenomenally<00:02:05.780> faster<00:02:06.260> now<00:02:06.890> let's<00:02:07.070> go

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
t3g is phenomenally faster now let's go

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.700 
t3g is phenomenally faster now let's go
back<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.640> original<00:02:07.700> site<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.420> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.170> the
