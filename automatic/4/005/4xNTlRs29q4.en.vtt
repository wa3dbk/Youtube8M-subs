00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:09.750
 [music] 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.469
 I greet you dear lovers and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.990
 chess experts I returned again after 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.630
 long New Year holidays and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 spree time it's time again 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 enrich your brain to engage 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.550
 chess 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.080
 i'm actually starting a new batch 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 tell you scandinavian to turned out 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 and I do not like this option in my 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.170
 even in the blitz I wrote it down 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.230
 I like it so much that I didn’t understand how 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.750
 play 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.430
 right 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.430
 for 4 there is such a move it seems 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.300
 honestly I don’t remember anything wrong 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.000
 from the forest 4 communications and 4 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.420
 he somehow does not really like it 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 option 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.580
 I will honestly say 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.689
 let's take a risk 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 and ours 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.549
 wow approach 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.710
 creative mind queen 4 step 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.659
 consistently 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.190
 what my opponent played did not think 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.720
 that this should give you equality 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.720
 then speeding up just developing 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.740
 it is not worth wise 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.270
 I will play ferre now 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.090
 4 inherent in zizhikin 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 began then queen 403 seems to me 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 not bad trip 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.800
 or queen b3 don't even know which is better 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.440
 see b7 to hold the air 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.519
 for 4 with a threat of 2 5 3 then 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.519
 attack pawn 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.450
 fuck cleaned out just castling would 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.520
 fate followed bros 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.520
 we would not have received a rival 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.040
 with meaning 3 just in case pawn 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.069
 don't take first make useless 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.230
 tail 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.400
 maybe even a pawn on e5 and now I 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.360
 by the way 1 of 7 he's holding the right ones 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.360
 Please only true 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.459
 but what I what I 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.970
 it is said I will not watch a gift horse 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.000
 better teeth I will eat a pawn 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.660
 40 must be allowed to beat 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660
 once 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.960
 unique 7 freezes options 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.680
 in short all the guys hike rival just 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.680
 swam 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.609
 book 5 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.630
 attention mask tension from the center 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:38.520
 a little bit not harmonious figure standing at 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 opponent hb4 attacked the queen 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.350
 induced 5 let's play all the same 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.760
 pawns to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.760
 it is necessary to bring these movement 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.680
 pawn 7 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.470
 take aim 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.730
 now maybe play an elephant c4 even or 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.629
 yes ellison 6 is a good decision 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.629
 it seems to me 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.210
 now play up to 6 we will shut up strongly 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.210
 notified pass 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.890
 he now with us we have straight 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.070
 begs 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.800
 sorry sorry rival 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.800
 I did not want to tachograph immediately forced me 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.650
 window like 3 we suddenly became 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.440
 very stupid 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.440
 right there is nothing for people cells 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.090
 now follow the party I think 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.230
 rival powerful persistent fighter 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.900
 deserves respect for his heroism but 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.110
 I'm afraid one of heroism will be a little 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.110
 positions 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.729
 but after the exchange of queens for sure 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.879
 heroism do not boast 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.400
 so sopi but did not admit defeat well 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.520
