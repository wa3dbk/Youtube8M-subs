00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
cornrow so that way as you're braiding
the<00:01:38.939> loop<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:39.869> instead<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.320> underneath

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the loop is up top instead of underneath

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.649 
the loop is up top instead of underneath
because<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> signature<00:01:42.240> look<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
because that's the signature look of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.190 
because that's the signature look of
ghana<00:01:42.930> braids<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.600> gonna<00:01:48.720> braid<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
ghana braids so you're gonna braid for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
ghana braids so you're gonna braid for
just<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> couple<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.860> times<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.460> four<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
just a couple more times about four to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
just a couple more times about four to
five<00:01:50.850> times<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.649> free<00:01:53.009> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
five times so that way you can free your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.399 
five times so that way you can free your
finger<00:01:53.790> again<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.600> left<00:01:54.780> hand<00:01:55.079> you're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and then the other new leg to the outer

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
and then the other new leg to the outer
leg<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> cornrow<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.350> every<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.100> add

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.879 
easy all you have to do is cut the end
of<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.540> braid<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.019> then<00:03:19.109> finish<00:03:19.440> taking<00:03:19.680> it

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
of the braid and then finish taking it

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.979 
of the braid and then finish taking it
down<00:03:20.040> by<00:03:20.280> hand<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:21.209> you're<00:03:21.359> not<00:03:21.540> sure<00:03:21.780> as<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
down by hand if you're not sure as to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.659 
down by hand if you're not sure as to
where<00:03:22.139> your<00:03:22.260> hair<00:03:22.470> ends<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.010> highly<00:03:23.489> suggest

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
where your hair ends I highly suggest

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.220 
where your hair ends I highly suggest
that<00:03:23.909> you<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:24.480> cut<00:03:24.750> through<00:03:24.900> your<00:03:24.959> braid

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that you don't cut through your braid

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.710 
that you don't cut through your braid
but<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:25.980> unravel<00:03:26.519> from<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.819> very<00:03:27.060> end<00:03:27.359> and

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
but just unravel from the very end and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.479 
but just unravel from the very end and
work<00:03:27.989> your<00:03:28.169> way<00:03:28.319> up<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.739> take<00:03:28.949> your<00:03:29.099> hair<00:03:29.280> down

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
work your way up to take your hair down

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.159 
work your way up to take your hair down
so<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.209> don't<00:03:30.359> accidentally<00:03:30.780> cut<00:03:30.840> your

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
so that you don't accidentally cut your

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:38.479 
so that you don't accidentally cut your
real<00:03:31.379> hair<00:03:36.650> because<00:03:37.650> pieces<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.159> hair<00:03:38.340> were

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
real hair because pieces of hair were

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.369 
real hair because pieces of hair were
added<00:03:38.909> it's<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.359> important<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.260> you

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
added it's very important that you

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.319 
added it's very important that you
actually<00:03:40.409> smooth<00:03:41.190> your<00:03:41.489> real<00:03:41.729> hair<00:03:41.970> out<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
actually smooth your real hair out of

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.119 
actually smooth your real hair out of
the<00:03:42.449> extension<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.139> instead<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.799> pulling

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
the extension here instead of pulling

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.309 
the extension here instead of pulling
the<00:03:44.430> extension<00:03:45.000> hair<00:03:45.209> or<00:03:45.359> yanking<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.930> off<00:03:46.139> of

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
the extension hair or yanking it off of

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.770 
the extension hair or yanking it off of
your<00:03:46.500> real<00:03:46.650> hair<00:03:46.909> when<00:03:47.909> you<00:03:48.030> notice<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.449> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
braids are becoming a little bit more

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.589 
braids are becoming a little bit more
tighter<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.879> can<00:03:51.030> actually<00:03:51.359> see<00:03:51.479> where

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
tighter and you can actually see where

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.240 
tighter and you can actually see where
your<00:03:51.690> hair<00:03:51.840> ends<00:03:52.169> go<00:03:52.590> ahead<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:52.979> cut<00:03:53.129> if<00:03:53.220> you

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
your hair ends go ahead and cut if you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.009
