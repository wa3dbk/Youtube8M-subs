00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.820 
we want to do is we want to take the
harness<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.540> lot<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.870> times<00:01:09.080> people<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.590> get

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.680 
harness a lot of times people can get
confused<00:01:10.370> with<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.670> harness<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.210> there's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
confused with the harness and there's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.630 
confused with the harness and there's
two<00:01:11.900> key<00:01:12.200> points<00:01:12.740> about<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.130> harness

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
two key points about the harness

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.530 
two key points about the harness
I<00:01:13.670> suggest<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.500> do<00:01:15.680> first<00:01:16.010> is<00:01:16.540> set

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
I suggest that what you do first is set

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.480 
I suggest that what you do first is set
the<00:01:17.659> harness<00:01:17.990> up<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.380> hold<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.280> get

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
the harness up and hold it so you get

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.940 
the harness up and hold it so you get
oriented<00:01:19.970> with<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.080> front<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.800> what

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
the back is before you start trying to

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.660 
the back is before you start trying to
throw<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.229> your<00:01:24.380> dog<00:01:24.590> what<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.280> first<00:01:25.520> want

strap<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.110> we're<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> loop<00:01:55.250> it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
strap and we're going to loop it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.539 
strap and we're going to loop it
underneath<00:01:55.880> Sonny's<00:01:56.420> body<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:58.220> it's<00:01:58.369> really

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
underneath Sonny's body so it's really

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.219 
underneath Sonny's body so it's really
important<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.180> these<00:01:59.360> side<00:01:59.659> panels<00:02:00.080> are

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
important that these side panels are

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.770 
important that these side panels are
right<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.580> shoulder<00:02:01.820> blades<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.600> have

right on the shoulder blades like I have

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.250 
right on the shoulder blades like I have
them<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.110> Sonny<00:02:03.409> another<00:02:04.159> key<00:02:04.580> point<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.689> that

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
them on Sonny another key point is that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.279 
them on Sonny another key point is that
you<00:02:06.439> need<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.830> have<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.729> top<00:02:08.030> strap<00:02:08.479> pretty

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
tight and secure it's not so important

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
tight and secure it's not so important

make sure these straps are good and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.070 
make sure these straps are good and
tight<00:02:37.350> again<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.460> that<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.480> tight<00:02:39.870> as

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080

it<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.260> go<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.560> secure<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.570> be

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
it can go and secure as it is it can be

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
it can go and secure as it is it can be
on<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.020> top<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> lot<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.130> times<00:02:44.370> eventually

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
on the top now a lot of times eventually

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120 
on the top now a lot of times eventually
you'll<00:02:45.240> adjust<00:02:45.330> these<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.200> order<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.800> drop

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
you'll adjust these in order to drop

is that when you have the card adjusted
there's<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.700> play<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.900> cart<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
there's a little play in the cart that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.350 
there's a little play in the cart that
doesn't<00:03:10.920> affect<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.400> function<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> car

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
doesn't affect the function of the car

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.520 
doesn't affect the function of the car
but<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.020> can<00:03:13.640> stabilize<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.970> by<00:03:15.870> putting<00:03:16.380> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
but you can stabilize it by putting in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.400 
but you can stabilize it by putting in
the<00:03:16.650> set<00:03:16.920> screws<00:03:17.310> into<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.570> little<00:03:18.840> holes<00:03:19.110> in

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the set screws into the little holes in

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.229 
the set screws into the little holes in
the<00:03:19.440> back<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:24.090> will<00:03:24.330> secure<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.810> down<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:27.090> is

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the back this will secure it down it is

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.150 
the back this will secure it down it is
definitely<00:03:27.900> easier<00:03:27.930> initially<00:03:28.830> when<00:03:29.010> you're

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
definitely easier initially when you're

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.580 
definitely easier initially when you're
getting<00:03:29.310> used<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.269> cart<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:31.019> have<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> help
