00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
think the score is 824 maybe I'll put a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.390 
think the score is 824 maybe I'll put a
solid<00:02:01.030> maybe<00:02:01.180> 80<00:02:01.540> 85<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.160> doesn't

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
solid maybe 80 85 but that doesn't

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:31.050 
solid maybe 80 85 but that doesn't
matter<00:02:03.460> it's<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.730> other<00:02:03.880> squirtle<00:02:04.270> matters
