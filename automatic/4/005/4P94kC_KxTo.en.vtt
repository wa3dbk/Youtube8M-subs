which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> mouse<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.380> used<00:01:07.650> prior<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
which is the mouse I used prior to this

which is the mouse I used prior to this
one<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.090> fits<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> hand<00:01:09.689> well<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
one it fits in the hand well and the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
one it fits in the hand well and the
buttons<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.650> relatively<00:01:11.100> easy<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.580> access

the<00:01:12.450> only<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> bit<00:01:13.409> awkward<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the only one that is a bit awkward to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.859 
the only one that is a bit awkward to
hit<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> g11<00:01:14.580> button<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> top

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
hit is the g11 button that is on the top

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
hit is the g11 button that is on the top
on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.409> sides<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> mouse<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
on the sides of the mouse there is a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.850 
on the sides of the mouse there is a
texture<00:01:17.880> plastic<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> add<00:01:18.630> grip<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> feels

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
texture plastic to add grip but it feels

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
texture plastic to add grip but it feels
a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.159> bit<00:01:20.369> gritty<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> first<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.630> my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
a little bit gritty when I first put my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
a little bit gritty when I first put my
hand<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.530> thought<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.100> hand<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
hand on it actually thought my hand was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
hand on it actually thought my hand was
dirty<00:01:23.670> until<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.090> realized<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.840> actually

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
dirty until I realized that was actually

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
dirty until I realized that was actually
the<00:01:25.380> grip<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> mouse<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.250> wasn't<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> big<00:01:27.090> fan

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the grip on the mouse I wasn't a big fan

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
the grip on the mouse I wasn't a big fan
of<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.600> first<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.020> after<00:01:28.170> using<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.680> a
