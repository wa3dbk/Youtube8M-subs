is it's just straight line quilting but
it's<00:01:57.790> very<00:01:58.180> fast<00:01:58.570> because<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.380> walking<00:01:59.770> foot

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
it's very fast because the walking foot

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.190 
it's very fast because the walking foot
does<00:02:00.160> all<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.970> feeding<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.110> have
