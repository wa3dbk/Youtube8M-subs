00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 in this car that you are going to see 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.700
 how many people do you think will fit 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.470
 tied with and makeup documented 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.470
 these have some well documented 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:45.120
 and a fantastic wonderful that I 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.489
 It helped a lot with sight when it was very 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 Little girl the oldest she came from Peru 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.360
 and told me that she came in the suitcase 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.030
 of a bus some way from a 2 to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.210
 crossing the radio and telling me what it was but 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.359
 so is the position he tells me was this in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 this position gave many many hours and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.650
 after and now you like that and by giving life to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.740
 another person and many people like that all in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 one 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 super 6 and in a part that I do not remember 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.399
 this minute which they are already told below and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.220
 run but textual and that was strap 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.439
 months more darkness was absolute unity and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.460
 with whistles they guided them but one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460
 wild question 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 so I told it was in the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 most terrible feeling his life good me 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.820
 says that the position and the 12 hours of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:38.190
 be with the body contracted but 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.750
 when they tell you we did 20 of the 20 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 people when they reached a point in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.479
 that there was a person who brought them 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.840
 after I do not know how much time to have 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.840
 run instead of 20 count you to day 14 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 the best toy in the world which is the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 best in the world 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.869
 to change the opinion because this is 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 far but far the best toy of the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.870
 world that is a Japanese company that 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.880
 he developed an impressive transform 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:23.270
 it's a robot that turns into a car 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.290
 reverse but where better because only in 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:32.950
 this robot can walk a value can 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 run missile 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.080
 is the form again in the form of auto 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.520
 arrived a remote-controlled vehicle that like 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.800
 in the fortune 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.560
 now to give but we make a strong 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.390
 in bad news from a prototype and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.900
 It is not yet for sale but soon 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.900
