preparing something else also we went

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.270 
preparing something else also we went
for<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> really<00:05:14.700> fast<00:05:14.940> layer<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.169> um<00:05:16.409> you<00:05:16.979> might

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
for a really fast layer so um you might

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.250 
for a really fast layer so um you might

attack<00:05:19.650> into<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.700> base<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.180> mean<00:05:21.390> we<00:05:21.720> already

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
attack into the base I mean we already

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.800 
attack into the base I mean we already
discussed<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.590> them<00:05:22.950> this<00:05:23.750> distance<00:05:24.750> here

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
discussed that them this distance here

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.260 
discussed that them this distance here
the<00:05:25.080> air<00:05:25.289> distance<00:05:25.800> for<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.099> rush<00:05:26.310> fairly

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
the air distance for the rush fairly

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.050 
the air distance for the rush fairly
short<00:05:27.539> so<00:05:28.409> if<00:05:28.800> he's<00:05:28.979> going<00:05:29.220> for<00:05:29.370> ventral<00:05:29.789> sacks

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
short so if he's going for ventral sacks

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.339 
short so if he's going for ventral sacks
this<00:05:30.270> early<00:05:30.659> in<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.780> game<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.169> might<00:05:31.289> be
