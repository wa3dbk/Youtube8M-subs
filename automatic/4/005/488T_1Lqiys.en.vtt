for probably a month and a half now um
ok<00:00:30.539> I'll<00:00:30.660> start<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.170> basic<00:00:31.500> stuff<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ok I'll start with the basic stuff I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.540 
ok I'll start with the basic stuff I
believe<00:00:32.669> Mac<00:00:33.629> mascaras<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.500> twelve<00:00:34.949> dollars

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
believe Mac mascaras are twelve dollars

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
believe Mac mascaras are twelve dollars
i'm<00:00:35.940> pretty<00:00:36.810> sure<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.140> 12<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> could<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.770> 40

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
i'm pretty sure it's 12 it could be 40

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.389 
i'm pretty sure it's 12 it could be 40
but<00:00:38.280> i<00:00:38.310> think<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.640> 12<00:00:39.110> um<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.380> this<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.220> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
but i think it's 12 um and this one is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
but i think it's 12 um and this one is
just<00:00:41.430> called<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> colors<00:00:42.390> called<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.870> black

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just called the colors called all black

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
just called the colors called all black
and<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.760> 8<00:00:45.420> grams<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.290> point<00:00:46.739> 28<00:00:47.030> u.s.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and it is 8 grams or point 28 u.s.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
and it is 8 grams or point 28 u.s.
ounces<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.930> guessing<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.440> fluid

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
ounces which I'm guessing is fluid

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.280 
ounces which I'm guessing is fluid
ounces<00:00:50.219> um<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:53.219> brush<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.750> try<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
ounces um the brush I will try to take a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.840 
ounces um the brush I will try to take a
close<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.620> picture<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.700> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
close up picture so you can see this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
close up picture so you can see this
better<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.450> because<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.200> know<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.379> it'll

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
better so because I don't know if it'll

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.850 
better so because I don't know if it'll
focus<00:00:59.120> but<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> brush<00:01:01.469> looks

those lines and separation and length

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
those lines and separation and length
are<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.030> things<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.990> like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
are two things that I really really like

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
are two things that I really really like
in<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> mascara<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> ton<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
in a mascara I don't like a ton of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
in a mascara I don't like a ton of
volume<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> feel<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.650> makes<00:01:43.950> my

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
volume because I feel like it makes my

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.690 
volume because I feel like it makes my
lashes<00:01:44.430> look<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.939> little<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.240> too<00:01:45.450> fake<00:01:46.700> but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
lashes look a little bit too fake but

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340 
lashes look a little bit too fake but
this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.390> nice<00:01:48.509> job<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> looking

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this is a very nice job of looking

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.350 
this is a very nice job of looking
natural<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.400> um<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> formula<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
natural for me um the formula is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.380 
natural for me um the formula is
extremely<00:01:54.360> thick<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.220> was<00:01:56.220> very<00:01:56.579> very<00:01:56.939> very

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
extremely thick I was very very very

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
extremely thick I was very very very
shocked<00:01:57.900> when<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> opened<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.250> did

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
shocked when I opened this because I did

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.260 
shocked when I opened this because I did
not<00:01:59.520> expect<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.570> thick<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.149> you

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
not expect it to be so thick so if you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.719 
not expect it to be so thick so if you
don't<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.960> thick<00:02:04.350> mascaras<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.460> don't

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
don't like thick mascaras and you don't

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.660 
don't like thick mascaras and you don't
like<00:02:05.909> ones<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.259> terribly<00:02:08.159> easy<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
like ones that are a terribly easy to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
like ones that are a terribly easy to
layer<00:02:08.909> because<00:02:09.420> i<00:02:09.450> find<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.110> thicker<00:02:10.379> mascara

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
layer because i find the thicker mascara

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.180 
layer because i find the thicker mascara
is<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.610> harder<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.870> get

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is the harder it is to get

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.530 
is the harder it is to get
even<00:02:14.520> layers<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.880> don't<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.210> really

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
even layers so if you don't like really

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.370 
even layers so if you don't like really
thick<00:02:18.810> formulas<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.620> wouldn't<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.130> this

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
thick formulas I wouldn't go with this

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.290 
thick formulas I wouldn't go with this
it<00:02:22.380> does<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:23.040> does<00:02:23.100> everything<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.150> said

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
it does it does everything that it said

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.760 
it does it does everything that it said
in<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.450> description<00:02:24.990> does<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.470> very

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
in the description does that all very

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.210 
in the description does that all very
well<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:27.600> gives<00:02:27.780> me<00:02:28.020> very<00:02:28.170> very<00:02:28.290> nice<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.950> find

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
well it gives me very very nice to find

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.090 
well it gives me very very nice to find
lashes<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.240> they're<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.800> separated<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
lashes and they're very separated and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.370 
lashes and they're very separated and
lengthened<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.810> reason<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.140> call<00:02:34.260> this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
lengthened and the reason they call this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.820 
lengthened and the reason they call this
a<00:02:34.440> fiber-rich<00:02:35.270> mascara<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.750> has

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a fiber-rich mascara is because it has

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790 
a fiber-rich mascara is because it has
like<00:02:37.830> little<00:02:38.040> fibers<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> formula<00:02:39.800> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
like little fibers in the formula so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.100 
like little fibers in the formula so
like<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.520> wearing<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
like if I'm wearing this for like a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.190 
like if I'm wearing this for like a
super<00:02:43.710> super<00:02:44.010> super<00:02:44.160> long<00:02:44.490> time<00:02:45.200> sometimes

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
super super super long time sometimes

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.680 
super super super long time sometimes
there<00:02:46.980> will<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.670> if<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.270> gets<00:02:48.480> really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
there will be like if it gets really

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.240 
there will be like if it gets really
dried<00:02:49.020> out<00:02:49.050> or<00:02:49.380> something<00:02:49.740> there<00:02:49.950> will<00:02:50.070> be<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
dried out or something there will be a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.540 
dried out or something there will be a
little<00:02:50.580> bit<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:52.320> fibers<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.040> fall<00:02:53.340> out

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
little bit of the fibers that fall out

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.800 
little bit of the fibers that fall out
on<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:55.200> my<00:02:55.260> face<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.210> only

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
on my on my face but that it only

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.470 
on my on my face but that it only
happens<00:02:58.290> very<00:02:58.530> rarely<00:02:58.710> with<00:02:59.310> me<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.760> don't<00:03:00.030> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
happens very rarely with me I don't I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.970 
happens very rarely with me I don't I
haven't<00:03:00.660> quite<00:03:00.900> figured<00:03:01.080> out<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> reason<00:03:01.740> for

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
haven't quite figured out the reason for

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.110 
haven't quite figured out the reason for
it<00:03:02.100> um<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.590> overall<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.910> good

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it um but overall I think this is a good

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.250 
it um but overall I think this is a good
mascara<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.380> slightly<00:03:07.830> um<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:09.990> little

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
mascara it is slightly um it is a little

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.020 
mascara it is slightly um it is a little
bit<00:03:10.440> difficult<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.950> coat<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.670> your<00:03:11.790> lashes

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
bit difficult to coat all of your lashes

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.890 
bit difficult to coat all of your lashes
I<00:03:12.570> can<00:03:13.290> get<00:03:13.500> underneath<00:03:14.490> my<00:03:15.000> lashes<00:03:15.270> all<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
I can get underneath my lashes all the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.720 
I can get underneath my lashes all the
way<00:03:15.990> up<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.350> tip<00:03:16.650> very<00:03:16.950> very<00:03:17.130> easily<00:03:17.340> but

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
way up to the tip very very easily but

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.510 
way up to the tip very very easily but
it's<00:03:17.790> hard<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.390> me<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.720> go<00:03:18.870> over<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:20.220> top<00:03:20.489> of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
it's hard for me to go over the top of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.370 
it's hard for me to go over the top of
my<00:03:20.880> lashes<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> brush<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.170> think

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
my lashes with the brush but I think

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.080 
my lashes with the brush but I think
that's<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.620> me<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.160> i'm<00:03:23.430> paranoid<00:03:23.580> of

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
that's just me because i'm paranoid of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
that's just me because i'm paranoid of
messing<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:24.720> eye<00:03:24.750> makeup<00:03:25.050> um<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:28.800> does<00:03:29.190> have

messing on my eye makeup um it does have
a<00:03:29.430> slight<00:03:29.700> scent<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.930> kind<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:33.140> don't

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
a slight scent it's just kind of I don't

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.650 
a slight scent it's just kind of I don't
know<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.440> gone<00:03:34.620> smells<00:03:34.830> like<00:03:34.920> makeup<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.310> me

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
just like a very light generic sense

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.330 
just like a very light generic sense
it's<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:39.060> anything<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.660> bothers<00:03:40.200> me<00:03:40.500> it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it's not anything that bothers me it's

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.130 
it's not anything that bothers me it's
not<00:03:41.580> hypoallergenic<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.810> really
