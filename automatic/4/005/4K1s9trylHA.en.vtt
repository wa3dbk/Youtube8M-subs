00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.840
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.940
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.290
 goes nickel so today in this 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.150
 video as you can see i'm going 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.850
 present you a vehicle really what 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.110
 the fuck the tron ​​bike on gta 5 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.850
 really well done 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.420
 I will take you on a tour of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 vehicle with the character on the bike 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.750
 frankly it's really well done 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 aside it must therefore make a 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.100
 little a little manip we'll say for that 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.719
 the result is really beautiful 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.649
 put your character in invisible 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.960
 so look at you do not have the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.329
 character who is on the bike month 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.890
 dropped in invisible mode 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.489
 otherwise look it would not be super great 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.050
 so here I put on the bike normally 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.270
 and since it has been replaced so 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.739
 by a demon I think so it goes 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.570
 is placed as on the bike normally 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.489
 so put your character in mode 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 invisible like that there's no delusion 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.040
 really has a good result so that's 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.149
 we're going to go for a walk 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.519
 frankly that's pretty good role there 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.530
 does not have a change to level 2 at 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.450
 engine level or power 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.460
 really that aesthetics has been changed 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.280
 so the bike has the same behavior as 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 the demon and it runs quite well 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.909
 frankly if it goes 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.140
 so your comments do not hesitate to me 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.260
 tell what you think of two 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 vehicles at bn heard like here with 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.290
 the character in invisible is sure that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.400
 when we have michael's head 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.530
 exceeds above it is not terrible 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 but with that result with our 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220
 character in invisible frankly I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.690
 think it's really well done by 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.890
 against if you put yourself in plain sight at the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.380
 first person of the blow you have the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.490
 view above the character frankly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.730
 it can do well also it makes a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.740
 small view 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.509
 just above the guy's shoulders and that 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 frankly it does not hurt 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.969
 and so we come to the end of 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.539
 this video me i will leave you on 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.520
 its gameplay 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.289
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.759
 blue if the video you liked me I 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.289
 stole it's on these images I tell you to 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.289
 all good war and especially the world
