to<00:03:03.920> test<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.850> instant<00:03:05.270> streaming<00:03:05.450> don't

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
to test out the instant streaming don't

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.820 
to test out the instant streaming don't
ask<00:03:06.560> me<00:03:06.740> why<00:03:07.990> now<00:03:08.990> we<00:03:09.050> have<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> queued<00:03:09.590> up<00:03:09.650> and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
ask me why now we have it queued up and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.530 
ask me why now we have it queued up and
again<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.280> streaming<00:03:10.610> video<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.150> not<00:03:11.360> on

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
again it's a streaming video it's not on

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.660 
again it's a streaming video it's not on
my<00:03:11.660> hard<00:03:11.870> drive<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.410> hit<00:03:12.560> play<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.100> buffers

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
my hard drive so hit play and buffers

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:27.350 
my hard drive so hit play and buffers
for<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.270> few<00:03:14.420> seconds<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.080> there<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.590> goes

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.240 

so<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.510> didn't<00:03:28.750> take<00:03:28.870> long<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.410> start<00:03:29.800> at<00:03:30.040> all

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so it didn't take long to start at all

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.120 
so it didn't take long to start at all
so<00:03:30.849> let's<00:03:30.880> try<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.420> fast-forward<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.440> see<00:03:33.010> how

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
so let's try to fast-forward it see how

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.050 
so let's try to fast-forward it see how
that<00:03:33.340> works<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.010> actually<00:03:36.340> moves<00:03:36.550> forward

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
that works and it actually moves forward

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.250 
that works and it actually moves forward
instead<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.599> doing<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.989> sort<00:03:38.170> of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
instead of doing this sort of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.470 
instead of doing this sort of
frame-by-frame<00:03:38.739> thing<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.760> Netflix<00:03:40.239> does

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
frame-by-frame thing that Netflix does

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.120 
frame-by-frame thing that Netflix does
where<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.080> see<00:03:41.200> little<00:03:41.350> thumbnails<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
where you just see little thumbnails of

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.130 
where you just see little thumbnails of
it<00:03:42.220> going<00:03:42.430> by<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:43.209> whenever<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.540> hit<00:03:43.630> play<00:03:43.780> it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
it going by and whenever you hit play it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.960 
it going by and whenever you hit play it
just<00:03:44.200> starts<00:03:44.860> right<00:03:45.069> up<00:03:45.100> where<00:03:45.520> you<00:03:45.580> left<00:03:45.760> off

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
just starts right up where you left off

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.540 
just starts right up where you left off
so<00:03:46.930> let's<00:03:47.140> skip<00:03:47.680> forward<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:48.069> little<00:03:48.160> bit<00:03:48.280> more

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
so let's skip forward a little bit more

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.640 
so let's skip forward a little bit more
you<00:03:49.390> can<00:03:49.420> see<00:03:49.660> like<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:49.989> said<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.290> actually

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
you can see like I said it actually

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.710 
you can see like I said it actually
moves<00:03:50.890> as<00:03:51.160> if<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.400> were<00:03:51.580> fast-forwarding<00:03:52.510> say

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
moves as if you were fast-forwarding say

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.320 
moves as if you were fast-forwarding say
a<00:03:52.959> DVD<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.890> can<00:03:54.160> speed<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.400> up<00:03:54.580> once<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.209> hit

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
a DVD and you can speed it up once I hit

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.860 
a DVD and you can speed it up once I hit
play<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:56.440> starts<00:03:56.800> instantly<00:03:57.690> alright<00:03:58.690> so

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
play it starts instantly alright so

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.759 
play it starts instantly alright so
