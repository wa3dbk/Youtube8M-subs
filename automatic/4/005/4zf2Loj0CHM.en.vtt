00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
little bit in here and we're going to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.950 
little bit in here and we're going to
pry<00:02:02.760> between<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.440> pad<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.700> rotor

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
pry between the the pad and the rotor

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.750 
pry between the the pad and the rotor
pushing<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.380> Pistons<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.430> so<00:02:08.640> those

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
pushing the Pistons back in so those

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.210 
pushing the Pistons back in so those
Pistons<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.929> outboard<00:02:10.320> side<00:02:10.380> there's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
Pistons on on the outboard side there's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
Pistons on on the outboard side there's
pistons<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.820> inboard<00:02:12.060> side<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:13.080> I'm

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
pistons on the inboard side and I'm

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.320 
pistons on the inboard side and I'm
going<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.380> pry<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.670> bit<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.150> get

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
going to pry a little bit here so I get

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.400 
going to pry a little bit here so I get
a<00:02:15.360> little<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.690> room<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> maneuver<00:02:15.990> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
a little bit of room to maneuver and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.690 
a little bit of room to maneuver and
then<00:02:16.740> I'll<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:16.980> take<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> pair<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.490> pliers

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
then I'll just take a pair of pliers

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.780 
then I'll just take a pair of pliers
grab<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.750> brake<00:02:19.170> pads<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.650> pull<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.040> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
grab the brake pads and pull them out so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.570 
grab the brake pads and pull them out so
okay<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> loosened<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.070> how<00:02:23.130> nice

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
okay I loosened it you can see how nice

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
okay I loosened it you can see how nice
and<00:02:23.760> loose<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.090> found<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> best<00:02:24.630> technique<00:02:24.990> was

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and loose I found the best technique was

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.550 
and loose I found the best technique was
is<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:26.040> go<00:02:26.190> next<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> rotor<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.150> twist<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is to go next to the rotor and twist so

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
is to go next to the rotor and twist so
I<00:02:28.590> would<00:02:28.770> get<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.040> here<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.520> twist<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.270> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I would get go here and twist and then

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.750 
I would get go here and twist and then
and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.560> once<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.160> pried<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.550> there

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and then once I got it pried out there

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then once I got it pried out there
that<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.360> thing<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.190> do

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that I can get the thing in there and do

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.100 
that I can get the thing in there and do
some<00:02:35.370> prying<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.600> there's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> ton<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
some prying and now there's a ton of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.580 
some prying and now there's a ton of
room<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:39.000> here<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> actually<00:02:40.410> comes

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
room in here and it actually comes

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.810 
room in here and it actually comes
pretty<00:02:40.770> easily<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.550> things<00:02:41.700> just

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
pretty easily and now these things just

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.390 
pretty easily and now these things just
pull<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.239> one<00:02:42.630> pulls<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.010> them<00:02:44.160> pulls

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
pull out one pulls out the of them pulls

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.060 
pull out one pulls out the of them pulls
out<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.930> there's<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.020> little<00:02:46.709> metal<00:02:46.770> plate

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
out and there's a little metal plate

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.120 
out and there's a little metal plate
that<00:02:47.520> comes<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> each<00:02:48.330> one<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.070> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that comes in each one and that so is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
that comes in each one and that so is
what<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:50.700> here's<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.330> new<00:02:51.570> pads<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
what we got here here's the new pads and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.770 
what we got here here's the new pads and
they<00:02:52.440> can't<00:02:52.709> came<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.190> shims<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> way

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
they can't came with shims so the way

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
they can't came with shims so the way
these<00:02:54.900> shims<00:02:55.230> work<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.650> they<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> back

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
these shims work is they go on the back

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.840 
these shims work is they go on the back
here<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.360> peel<00:02:57.720> off<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.050> adhesive<00:02:58.520> strip

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.940 

carefully<00:03:03.110> line<00:03:04.110> up<00:03:04.140> there's<00:03:04.590> little<00:03:04.800> holes

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
carefully line up there's little holes

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.500 
carefully line up there's little holes
there<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.400> give<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> thing<00:03:05.820> they<00:03:05.970> push<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.360> there

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
there to give a thing they push on there

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.240 
there to give a thing they push on there
let<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.690> stuck<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.080> there

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.740 

that's<00:03:18.250> stuck<00:03:18.490> on<00:03:18.640> there<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.420> next<00:03:19.630> thing

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's stuck on there and the next thing

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.020 
that's stuck on there and the next thing
to<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:19.990> is<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.740> take<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.040> old<00:03:21.070> sensors<00:03:21.610> off<00:03:21.760> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
to do is to take the old sensors off I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.270 
to do is to take the old sensors off I
mean<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.690> saw<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> website<00:03:23.860> they<00:03:24.010> had<00:03:24.160> these

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
mean I saw a website they had these

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.530 
mean I saw a website they had these
sensors<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.940> dollar

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
sensors for a dollar

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750 
sensors for a dollar
so<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.050> in<00:03:26.380> if<00:03:26.680> you're<00:03:26.920> smart<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.550> buy<00:03:27.700> this

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
so you in if you're smart you buy this

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.730 
so you in if you're smart you buy this
stuff<00:03:28.090> mail-order<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.780> my<00:03:28.900> ceramic<00:03:29.530> brake

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
stuff mail-order you my ceramic brake

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.920 
stuff mail-order you my ceramic brake
pads<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.340> really<00:03:30.490> should<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.780> went

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
pads like you really should I just went

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
pads like you really should I just went
down<00:03:32.050> local<00:03:32.410> auto<00:03:32.590> parts<00:03:32.680> store<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.160> got<00:03:33.340> got

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
down local auto parts store and got got

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.270 
down local auto parts store and got got
these<00:03:33.820> things<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.050> $27<00:03:35.740> we're<00:03:36.070> kind<00:03:36.220> of

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
these things here for $27 we're kind of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.470 
these things here for $27 we're kind of
a<00:03:36.340> rusher<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.640> they<00:03:36.790> didn't<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.030> sensors

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
a rusher and they didn't have sensors

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.930 
a rusher and they didn't have sensors
but<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.260> old<00:03:38.410> sensors<00:03:38.770> are<00:03:38.890> fine<00:03:39.130> they<00:03:39.670> kind

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
but the old sensors are fine they kind

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.250 
but the old sensors are fine they kind
of<00:03:40.000> pry<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.420> okay<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.690> just<00:03:40.900> pulled<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.140> one

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
of pry out okay I just pulled the one

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.060 
of pry out okay I just pulled the one
sensor<00:03:41.620> out<00:03:42.300> pulled<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.690> other<00:03:44.590> sensor

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
sensor out pulled it the other sensor

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.260 
sensor out pulled it the other sensor
out<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.810> basically<00:03:47.170> kind<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> see<00:03:47.710> others<00:03:47.950> up

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
out and basically kind of see others up

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.970 
out and basically kind of see others up
you<00:03:49.270> know<00:03:49.390> if<00:03:49.570> your<00:03:49.900> pads<00:03:50.230> are<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:50.500> bad<00:03:50.680> lights

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you know if your pads are so bad lights

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.560 
you know if your pads are so bad lights
came<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.340> these<00:03:51.490> sensors<00:03:51.820> will<00:03:51.880> be<00:03:51.970> fried<00:03:52.300> but

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
came on these sensors will be fried but

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.960 
came on these sensors will be fried but
that's<00:03:52.990> these<00:03:53.440> are<00:03:53.620> still<00:03:53.830> good<00:03:54.010> shape<00:03:54.250> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
that's these are still good shape and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.760 
that's these are still good shape and
then<00:03:55.240> kind<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.510> see<00:03:55.720> they<00:03:55.900> there's<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.560> hole

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
then kind of see they there's a hole

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.530 
then kind of see they there's a hole
right<00:03:56.800> here<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.760> sensor<00:03:58.030> goes<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.420> hole

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
right here the sensor goes in the hole

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.600 
right here the sensor goes in the hole
push<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.320> here<00:03:59.620> I<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.940> backwards<00:04:04.090> okay

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
push in here I do that backwards okay

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.420 
push in here I do that backwards okay
push<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:06.850> here<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:08.740> now<00:04:08.890> we're<00:04:08.950> ready<00:04:09.280> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
push it in here and now we're ready to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.730 
push it in here and now we're ready to
put<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.610> brake<00:04:09.730> okay<00:04:09.820> uh<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.560> didn't

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
put the brake okay uh if you didn't

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.500 
put the brake okay uh if you didn't
really<00:04:11.920> push<00:04:12.100> too<00:04:12.280> hard<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.850> could<00:04:13.300> probably

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
really push too hard you could probably

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.850 
really push too hard you could probably
get<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.840> Pistons<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.350> all<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> way<00:04:14.680> at<00:04:14.770> the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
get the Pistons in all the way at the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.440 
get the Pistons in all the way at the
screwdriver<00:04:15.310> but<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:15.850> always<00:04:16.090> like<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.330> use<00:04:16.359> a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
screwdriver but I always like to use a

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.570 
screwdriver but I always like to use a
c-clamp<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.950> they<00:04:18.100> weren't<00:04:18.220> quite<00:04:18.400> in

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
c-clamp so that they weren't quite in

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.070 
c-clamp so that they weren't quite in
all<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.760> way<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:18.940> now<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> put<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.540> C<00:04:19.690> clamp<00:04:19.930> up

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
all the way so now I put the C clamp up

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.110 
all the way so now I put the C clamp up
here<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.799> we<00:04:21.040> don't<00:04:21.130> have<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.670> force<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.090> just

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
here and we don't have to force it just

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.270 
here and we don't have to force it just
do<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.600> nice<00:04:22.750> easy<00:04:22.990> I'm<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.010> one

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
do a nice easy I'm going to do this one

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.660 
do a nice easy I'm going to do this one
and<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.480> four<00:04:25.780> four<00:04:26.290> Pistons<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.920> see

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
and there's four four Pistons and see

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.790 
and there's four four Pistons and see
you<00:04:27.820> all<00:04:27.970> four<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.570> push<00:04:29.230> them<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.470> all<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
you all four and push them in all the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.610 
you all four and push them in all the
way<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.700> everything<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.120> fine<00:04:31.360> okay<00:04:32.140> now

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
way and then everything be fine okay now

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.290 
way and then everything be fine okay now
we're<00:04:32.860> ready<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.070> already<00:04:33.550> got<00:04:33.730> one<00:04:33.880> side<00:04:34.150> in

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
we're ready to already got one side in

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.610 
we're ready to already got one side in
that<00:04:34.419> one<00:04:34.540> pretty<00:04:34.690> easy<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.020> find<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.590> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
that one pretty easy I find this is a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.550 
that one pretty easy I find this is a
little<00:04:36.040> tricky<00:04:36.250> they<00:04:36.520> come<00:04:36.760> with<00:04:36.880> these<00:04:36.970> metal

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
little tricky they come with these metal

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.950 
little tricky they come with these metal
backing<00:04:38.560> plates<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:39.970> put<00:04:40.270> these<00:04:40.390> in<00:04:40.450> over

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
backing plates so I put these in over

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.280 
backing plates so I put these in over
the<00:04:41.310> Pistons<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.490> then<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:43.720> easier<00:04:44.260> to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
the Pistons and then that it's easier to

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.470 
the Pistons and then that it's easier to
slide<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.740> thing<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.250> there<00:04:45.910> we're<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.120> so

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
slide this thing and there we're in so

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.730 
slide this thing and there we're in so
now<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:47.380> just<00:04:47.410> have<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:48.419> put<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.620> put<00:04:50.620> this

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
now we just have to put the put this

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.120 
now we just have to put the put this
clip<00:04:51.280> in<00:04:51.430> here<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.880> then<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.990> two<00:04:53.410> pins<00:04:53.800> and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
clip in here and then the two pins and

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.150 
clip in here and then the two pins and
then<00:04:54.640> we'll<00:04:54.820> be<00:04:54.940> done<00:04:55.440> anyway<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:56.830> we're<00:04:56.980> put

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
then we'll be done anyway now we're put

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.110 
then we'll be done anyway now we're put
things<00:04:57.370> back<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.610> there

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
things back in there

screwdriver I I position the pan so all
the<00:05:02.710> holes<00:05:02.919> line<00:05:03.250> up<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.669> everything<00:05:03.970> looks

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.270 
the holes line up and everything looks
good<00:05:04.419> push<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.380> thing<00:05:05.620> in<00:05:05.740> there<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:06.070> kind

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
good push this thing in there it's kind

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.680 
good push this thing in there it's kind
of<00:05:06.340> most<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.730> way<00:05:06.850> in<00:05:06.970> here<00:05:07.180> but<00:05:07.300> not<00:05:07.390> all<00:05:07.570> the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
of most the way in here but not all the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.070 
of most the way in here but not all the
way<00:05:07.780> in<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.110> then<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:10.090> had<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.780> take<00:05:10.930> this

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
way in and then I had to take this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.590 
way in and then I had to take this
screwdriver<00:05:11.530> press<00:05:12.460> down<00:05:12.700> on<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:12.940> pad<00:05:13.270> and

to get everything straight I had a

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.219 
to get everything straight I had a
little<00:06:09.909> bit<00:06:10.059> misaligned<00:06:10.329> so<00:06:10.719> I<00:06:10.779> put<00:06:10.989> the<00:06:11.079> nail

back in there and once I put the nail in
there<00:06:13.089> I<00:06:13.119> guess<00:06:13.299> my<00:06:13.599> pin<00:06:13.809> was<00:06:13.959> too<00:06:14.079> low<00:06:14.259> so<00:06:14.469> I<00:06:14.529> I

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
there I guess my pin was too low so I I

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
there I guess my pin was too low so I I
raised<00:06:15.009> up<00:06:15.159> there<00:06:15.399> and<00:06:15.489> I<00:06:15.519> took<00:06:15.610> my

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
raised up there and I took my

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.999 
raised up there and I took my
screwdriver<00:06:16.149> moved<00:06:16.479> around<00:06:16.809> and<00:06:17.199> did<00:06:17.949> the

screwdriver moved around and did the

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.549 
screwdriver moved around and did the
sink<00:06:18.219> in<00:06:18.339> the<00:06:18.399> bottom<00:06:18.729> and<00:06:18.909> then<00:06:19.419> I<00:06:19.559> hammered
