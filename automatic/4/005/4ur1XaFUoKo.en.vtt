00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:56.059
 and so here's a pre shot 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:59.559
 how is she planned to be so far 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.559
 nothing is fixed yet 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:11.530
 here you can see that door and so 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 make it far away just put on 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:24.229
 bone for an approximate delivery 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:27.140
 level so here is the belt it is not 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:33.530
 strained so basically what are they 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:36.229
 so awry hang it just no wonder you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.119
 can see and that they are absolutely not 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:46.549
 strained well somehow about something 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:49.549
 a spout looms too 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.640
 at an angle they are perpendicular because 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:59.210
 in the direction of rotation of the matrix, everything will be 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:02.750
 fly out this way and so what was 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.640
 decided to do generally decided to mount 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.640
 to move with the help of such pieces 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.170
 how is it all done 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:28.220
 all this is so inserted with this 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.220
 hand drinks we tighten a little bit 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.850
 delaying hard enough 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:14.800
 and now we collapse in this place afterwards 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:24.099
 when everything will be okay 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:27.269
 that with the help of this round door 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.269
 will stand on the spot 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:29.850
 Well, something like this 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.630
 not going anywhere but all the same 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.090
 Equal weld also here and in principle so 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.340
 can not be done and it is very wrong then 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.190
 what am I here the flange engine attached 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.970
 like this, but not 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.930
 everything in our world lends itself to the logic of those 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:54.720
 look further 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:00.200
 shots granulator relatively even 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.460
 without belt tension and welded 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.510
 just put on two plates in 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.640
 which two holes and showed because 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.260
 what is there anything to show if that 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.169
 show here see it in my vlog it 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.600
 a piece of spring what it turned out to be very 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.450
 hardened by the poet could not drill it 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:29.520
 so just believes just cut out here 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:34.650
 hole here and there it is 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.280
 I'll show it from below like this 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.610
 just put cair wait a little 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.610
 until all the structures have cooled and pulled 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:03.879
 actually something like this, recalling if 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.129
 you liked the video turned 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:10.830
 useful subscribe put your 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.830
 big thumbs up bye
