the tool around the wire pull and the

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.170 
the tool around the wire pull and the
wire<00:01:04.050> insulation<00:01:04.710> comes<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.190> now<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> course

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
wire insulation comes off now of course

around the screws and get a really nice
tight<00:01:15.630> fit<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.440> important<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.070> don't

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
tight fit very important and don't

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.830 
tight fit very important and don't

need one of those to strip the
insulation<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> wire<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.870> sure<00:01:22.140> when

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
insulation off the wire make sure when

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
insulation off the wire make sure when
you<00:01:22.590> run<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.980> razor<00:01:23.160> knife<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.880> wire

just cuts lightly through the insulation

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.640 
just cuts lightly through the insulation
right<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.630> through<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> center<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.560> the
