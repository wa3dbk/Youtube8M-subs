00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
well you're using the mouse hey you

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.480 
well you're using the mouse hey you
don't<00:01:50.049> need<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.409> use<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.890> mouse<00:01:51.040> when<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.400> use

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
don't need to use the mouse when you use

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.810 
don't need to use the mouse when you use
Excel<00:01:51.790> I'm<00:01:52.600> like<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.950> right<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.610> don't

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
Excel I'm like you're right you don't

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.190 
Excel I'm like you're right you don't
need<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.090> use<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.330> mouse<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.630> music<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
need to use the mouse with music so and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.249 
need to use the mouse with music so and
you're<00:01:56.320> actually<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.650> lot<00:01:57.009> faster<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:58.090> there<00:01:58.479> it

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
you're actually a lot faster so there it

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.170 
you're actually a lot faster so there it
was<00:01:59.380> kind<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.710> playing<00:02:00.100> Dueling<00:02:00.729> Excel

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
was kind of like playing Dueling Excel

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660 
was kind of like playing Dueling Excel
right<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.140> they<00:02:02.439> said<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.250> don't<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.580> use

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
right so they said you don't have to use

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.520 
right so they said you don't have to use
the<00:02:03.790> mouse<00:02:03.909> at<00:02:04.090> all<00:02:04.180> equal<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.540> plus<00:02:05.049> two<00:02:05.290> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the mouse at all equal to plus two and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.830 
the mouse at all equal to plus two and
that<00:02:06.250> formula<00:02:06.520> here's<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.030> they<00:02:07.119> do<00:02:07.180> left

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
that formula here's what they do left

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.319 
that formula here's what they do left
end<00:02:08.159> down<00:02:09.159> right<00:02:09.759> X<00:02:10.239> or<00:02:10.720> anything<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.439> up

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
end down right X or anything and up

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.300 
end down right X or anything and up
control<00:02:13.329> C<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:14.349> control<00:02:14.829> shift<00:02:15.129> down

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
control C and then control shift down

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.670 
control C and then control shift down
arrow<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.540> put<00:02:16.689> the<00:02:16.720> X<00:02:16.900> there<00:02:17.170> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
arrow and because we put the X there we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.949 
arrow and because we put the X there we
select<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> whole<00:02:18.069> range<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.670> control<00:02:19.000> V<00:02:19.209> I'm

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
select the whole range and control V I'm

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.690 
select the whole range and control V I'm
using<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.409> mouse<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:21.040> know<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> would

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
using the mouse you know it would

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.860 
using the mouse you know it would
actually<00:02:21.819> be<00:02:22.030> interesting<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.450> see<00:02:22.569> which<00:02:22.720> is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
actually be interesting to see which is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.390 
actually be interesting to see which is
faster<00:02:23.230> double-click<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> fill<00:02:23.950> handle<00:02:24.069> or

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
faster double-click the fill handle or

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.670 
faster double-click the fill handle or
do<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.300> whole<00:02:25.450> keystrokes<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.349> did<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
do that whole keystrokes if you did the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.350 
do that whole keystrokes if you did the
keystrokes

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
keystrokes

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
keystrokes
time<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.960> time<00:02:28.140> again<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> bet<00:02:29.310> there'd<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
time and time again I bet there'd be a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.540 
time and time again I bet there'd be a
very<00:02:29.970> fast<00:02:30.360> way<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.930> okay<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.740> you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
very fast way to do that okay so you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.740 
very fast way to do that okay so you
know<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> had<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.940> come<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.180> some<00:02:33.540> other

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
know I had to come up with some other

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.960 
know I had to come up with some other
trick<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> didn't<00:02:35.010> involve<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.550> mouse<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
trick that didn't involve the mouse and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.030 
trick that didn't involve the mouse and
then<00:02:36.090> Dave<00:02:36.990> from<00:02:37.230> California<00:02:37.770> said<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.010> right

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
then Dave from California said all right

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560 
then Dave from California said all right
here's<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.790> how<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.300> convert<00:02:39.510> that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
here's one how do you convert that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.450 
here's one how do you convert that
formula<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.080> values<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.620> three<00:02:40.980> keystrokes

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
formula to values in three keystrokes

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.610 
formula to values in three keystrokes
now<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.850> had<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.690> about<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.260> second

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
now I had to think about it for a second

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.590 
now I had to think about it for a second
I<00:02:43.680> came<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:44.010> with<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.430> thought<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.300> was<00:02:45.390> an

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
I came up with it I thought it was an

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.270 
I came up with it I thought it was an
interesting<00:02:45.930> trick<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> did<00:02:46.890> put<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> on

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
interesting trick so I did put that on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
interesting trick so I did put that on
Facebook<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.790> next<00:02:47.820> day<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.780> know<00:02:48.870> here's

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
Facebook the next day you know here's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.410 
Facebook the next day you know here's
the<00:02:49.290> quiz<00:02:49.470> how<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:51.270> few

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420

the quiz how can you do this and a few
people<00:02:51.690> came<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.890> interesting<00:02:53.430> ideas<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
people came up with interesting ideas a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.080 
people came up with interesting ideas a
lot<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.660> them<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.280> although<00:02:56.280> what<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:56.970> do

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
lot of them had it although what I do

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.920 
lot of them had it although what I do
like<00:02:57.390> about<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.220> Greg<00:02:59.480> says<00:03:00.480> he<00:03:00.630> uses

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
like about this is a Greg says he uses

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.320 
like about this is a Greg says he uses
application<00:03:01.650> dot<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.010> key<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.550> do<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.000> one

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
application dot on key to do it in one

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.229 
application dot on key to do it in one
keystroke<00:03:03.980> hooray<00:03:04.980> -<00:03:05.040> Greg<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.910> let's<00:03:06.120> come

keystroke hooray - Greg now let's come

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.880 
keystroke hooray - Greg now let's come
back<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.420> take<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> look<00:03:06.750> at<00:03:07.020> Dave<00:03:07.380> solution

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
back and take a look at Dave solution

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.380 
back and take a look at Dave solution
and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.130> we'll<00:03:08.280> also<00:03:08.400> take<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.670> look<00:03:08.730> at<00:03:09.060> Greg

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and then we'll also take a look at Greg

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.060 
and then we'll also take a look at Greg
solution<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.380> here's<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:10.830> we're<00:03:10.920> going<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
solution so here's what we're going to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.220 
solution so here's what we're going to
do<00:03:11.190> we're<00:03:11.310> gonna<00:03:11.400> press<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> f2<00:03:12.390> key<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.900> f2

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
do we're gonna press the f2 key the f2

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.740 
do we're gonna press the f2 key the f2
key<00:03:13.260> puts<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.860> cell<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.280> edit<00:03:14.670> mode<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.060> then

key puts that cell in edit mode and then
once<00:03:15.959> we<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> cell<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.650> edit<00:03:16.950> mode<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.310> you

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
once we have a cell in edit mode if you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.930 
once we have a cell in edit mode if you
press<00:03:17.670> f9<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:19.290> converts<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> current

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
press f9 it converts it to the current

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.060 
press f9 it converts it to the current
value<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.600> press<00:03:21.840> Enter<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.920> will

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
value and then press Enter and it will

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.030 
value and then press Enter and it will
convert<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.760> cell<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.690> Magus<00:03:25.440> let's<00:03:25.890> take<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
convert that cell to Magus let's take a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
convert that cell to Magus let's take a
look<00:03:26.280> at<00:03:26.370> Greg's<00:03:26.670> method<00:03:27.090> which<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
look at Greg's method which you know is

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
look at Greg's method which you know is
actually<00:03:28.170> even<00:03:28.500> better<00:03:28.650> Greg<00:03:29.430> goes<00:03:29.730> into

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
actually even better Greg goes into

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.650 
actually even better Greg goes into
Visual<00:03:30.270> Basic<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:32.549> workbook<00:03:33.000> open<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
Visual Basic and in the workbook open of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.539 
Visual Basic and in the workbook open of
his<00:03:33.840> personal<00:03:34.320> macro<00:03:34.650> workbook<00:03:34.860> he<00:03:35.310> uses

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
his personal macro workbook he uses

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.449 
his personal macro workbook he uses
application<00:03:36.239> key<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.860> assigns<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.430> a

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
application key and it assigns it to a

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.800 
application key and it assigns it to a
key<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.480> used<00:03:39.720> here<00:03:39.989> control<00:03:40.500> shift<00:03:40.890> V<00:03:41.340> and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
key so I used here control shift V and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.970 
key so I used here control shift V and
said<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.959> when<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.680> we're<00:03:43.830> going<00:03:43.920> to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
said that when we do that we're going to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.280 
said that when we do that we're going to
run<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> procedure<00:03:44.880> called<00:03:45.180> paste<00:03:45.600> values<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
run a procedure called paste values and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.729 
run a procedure called paste values and
then<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:47.100> module<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.660> one<00:03:48.989> line<00:03:49.380> macro

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
then in module one it's a one line macro

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.460 
then in module one it's a one line macro
one<00:03:50.100> line<00:03:50.250> macro<00:03:50.459> right<00:03:50.700> here<00:03:50.820> paste<00:03:51.120> values

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
one line macro right here paste values

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
one line macro right here paste values
so<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.530> need<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.769> get<00:03:52.890> rid<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:54.530> it's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
so I need to get rid of that there it's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.020 
so I need to get rid of that there it's
a<00:03:55.590> one<00:03:55.739> line<00:03:55.920> macro<00:03:56.160> selection<00:03:56.670> dot<00:03:56.820> value

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
a one line macro selection dot value

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.660 
a one line macro selection dot value
equals<00:03:57.480> selection<00:03:57.840> dot<00:03:57.989> value<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.680> now<00:03:59.010> here

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
equals selection dot value so now here

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.820 
equals selection dot value so now here
we<00:03:59.700> will<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.080> formula<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.560> have<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
we will have this formula so I have the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.610 
we will have this formula so I have the
formula<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.340> press<00:04:02.940> control<00:04:03.299> shift<00:04:03.330> V<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.170> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
formula just press control shift V and I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.699 
formula just press control shift V and I
convert<00:04:04.980> those<00:04:05.220> formulas<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.480> values<00:04:06.870> so

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
convert those formulas to values so

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.750 
convert those formulas to values so
there<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.340> couple<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.640> different

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
there you have it a couple of different

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.300 
there you have it a couple of different
ways<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.810> very<00:04:10.049> quickly<00:04:10.260> convert<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> single

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
ways to very quickly convert a single

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.039 
ways to very quickly convert a single
cell<00:04:11.459> from<00:04:11.700> formulas<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> values<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.660> of

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
cell from formulas to values and of

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.210 
cell from formulas to values and of
course<00:04:13.080> let's<00:04:13.890> just<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:15.209> completeness<00:04:15.600> here

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
course let's just for completeness here

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.349
