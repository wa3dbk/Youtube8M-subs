a shop big one was Anna gaff but we

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.140 
a shop big one was Anna gaff but we
realized<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.330> couldn't<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:50.150> we

realized we couldn't do that and then we

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.060 
realized we couldn't do that and then we
just<00:01:51.510> settled<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> pit<00:01:52.320> crew<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.860> name

just settled in on pit crew the name
came<00:01:53.340> from<00:01:53.520> where<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> guess<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.090> were<00:01:54.180> both

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
came from where I guess we were both

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.150 
came from where I guess we were both
like<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> cars<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> same<00:01:55.500> time<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
like in the cars at the same time and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.380 
like in the cars at the same time and

right<00:02:51.360> off<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.599> bat<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.870> was<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.110> nothing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
right off the bat it was just nothing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.949

but kind of awkward growth business was
actually<00:02:55.049> really<00:02:55.380> good<00:02:56.090> because<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
actually really good because there was a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420 
actually really good because there was a
strong<00:02:57.840> skate<00:02:58.560> community<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.099> we<00:02:59.190> first

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
but somewhere along the line we realized

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.290 
but somewhere along the line we realized
that<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.320> was<00:04:10.440> occurring<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.270> to
