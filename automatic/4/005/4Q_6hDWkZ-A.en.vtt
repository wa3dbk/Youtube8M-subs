in this tutorial I will show you how to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
in this tutorial I will show you how to
create<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.160> rock<00:00:05.520> in<00:00:05.730> blender<00:00:06.240> by<00:00:06.359> using<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
create this rock in blender by using the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.160 
create this rock in blender by using the
cyclist<00:00:07.529> render<00:00:07.919> engine<00:00:08.450> start<00:00:09.450> by<00:00:09.750> adding<00:00:09.900> a

cube to your scene control left click
and<00:00:13.679> call<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.460> rock<00:00:15.500> now<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.560> will<00:00:16.949> add<00:00:17.160> some

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
and call it rock now we will add some

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.830 
and call it rock now we will add some

if a value of 2 the second value 4

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.070 
if a value of 2 the second value 4
you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.710> lower<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> few<00:00:26.519> value<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> 1<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
you can lower the few value of 1 but I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070 
you can lower the few value of 1 but I
won't<00:00:28.529> cause<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.609> machine<00:00:30.210> isn't<00:00:30.840> slowing

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
won't cause my machine isn't slowing

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.750 
won't cause my machine isn't slowing
down<00:00:31.489> then<00:00:32.489> add<00:00:32.759> 2<00:00:33.630> &amp;<00:00:34.170> 3

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
down then add 2 &amp; 3

down then add 2 &amp; 3
displacement<00:00:35.760> modifiers<00:00:37.640> switch<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
displacement modifiers switch to the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.619 
displacement modifiers switch to the
textures<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.629> Voronoi

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
textures the first will be a Voronoi

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.720 
textures the first will be a Voronoi
with<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> size<00:00:43.649> 1<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.420> second<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.730> cloud

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with a size 1 the second will be cloud

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.380 
with a size 1 the second will be cloud
texture<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> depth<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.890> 8<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.149> size

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
texture with a depth of 8 and the size

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.130 
texture with a depth of 8 and the size
of<00:00:51.660> 0.5<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:53.210> third<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> noise

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
of 0.5 and third will be just the noise

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040 
of 0.5 and third will be just the noise
right<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
right there now you can see that this is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.549 
right there now you can see that this is
looking<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> rock<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> play

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
looking like a rock so we have to play

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
looking like a rock so we have to play
with<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.949> strength<00:01:05.250> settings<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
with the strength settings in the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.539 
with the strength settings in the
displacement<00:01:06.600> modifier<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> first<00:01:08.159> strength

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
displacement modifier the first strength

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
displacement modifier the first strength
will<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.350> 0.5<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.280> second<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.060> 0.25<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
will be 0.5 the second will be 0.25 and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.440 
will be 0.5 the second will be 0.25 and
the<00:01:14.130> third<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.729> point<00:01:15.420> zero<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:16.380> okay

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the third will be point zero one okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.140 
the third will be point zero one okay
this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> looking<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.140> better<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.979> T<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:21.119> open

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
this is looking way better so T to open

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.890 
this is looking way better so T to open
up<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> toolbar<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.500> smooth<00:01:23.360> key<00:01:24.360> once<00:01:24.570> again

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
up the toolbar and smooth key once again

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
up the toolbar and smooth key once again
and<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:26.040> UV<00:01:26.729> unwrap<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.600> add

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and now we will UV unwrap it to add

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.819 
and now we will UV unwrap it to add
color<00:01:28.439> map<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.490> edge<00:01:29.729> select<00:01:30.240> mode<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
color map so edge select mode and just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
color map so edge select mode and just
select<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.729> edges<00:01:33.890> ctrl<00:01:34.890> e<00:01:35.130> mark<00:01:36.119> seam<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
select some edges ctrl e mark seam a to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.179 
select some edges ctrl e mark seam a to
deselect<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.140> once<00:01:40.140> again<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.650> select<00:01:40.920> all

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
deselect all a once again to select all

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.990 
deselect all a once again to select all
you<00:01:42.030> keep<00:01:42.899> rejection<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:44.189> open<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.820> your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you keep rejection now open up your

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.319 
you keep rejection now open up your
image<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.600> grabbed<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:46.860> C<00:01:47.369> textures<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
image I grabbed this from C textures and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.920 
image I grabbed this from C textures and
it's<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.970> now<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.270> switch<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's this one and now if we switch to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.370 
it's this one and now if we switch to
material<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.020> black

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
material you can see that it's black

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
material you can see that it's black
cause<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.340> any<00:01:56.670> material<00:01:56.790> applied

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
cause we don't have any material applied

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
cause we don't have any material applied
to<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.920> new<00:01:59.130> material

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to this so new material

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.620 
to this so new material
call<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> rock<00:02:00.950> now<00:02:01.950> add<00:02:02.219> an<00:02:02.610> input<00:02:02.759> texture

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
call it rock now add an input texture

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.740 
call it rock now add an input texture

the RGB and the displacement and well
your<00:02:37.540> point<00:02:37.990> five<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.830> okay<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:40.630> as<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.959> set<00:02:41.140> up

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
your point five is okay now as I set up

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.320 
your point five is okay now as I set up
to<00:02:41.350> see<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.740> polite<00:02:42.270> son<00:02:43.270> left<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:46.030> will

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
to see in the polite son left you will

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.089 
to see in the polite son left you will
see

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.589 

the<00:02:54.640> strength<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.409> 10<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:58.150> yellow<00:02:58.420> we

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
the strength of 10 and the yellow we

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.789 
the strength of 10 and the yellow we
tint<00:02:59.159> now<00:03:00.159> you<00:03:00.730> will<00:03:00.939> see<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:02.430> our<00:03:03.430> rock<00:03:04.799> is

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
tint now you will see that our rock is

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.160 
tint now you will see that our rock is
looking<00:03:06.249> pretty<00:03:06.730> nice<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.719> a<00:03:07.930> little

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
looking pretty nice but it's a little

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.369 
looking pretty nice but it's a little
bit<00:03:08.349> too<00:03:08.769> clean<00:03:09.159> so<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.269> will<00:03:10.480> add<00:03:10.629> a<00:03:10.659> third<00:03:11.109> map

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
bit too clean so I will add a third map

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.770 
bit too clean so I will add a third map
to<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:13.079> shift<00:03:14.079> D<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:15.400> duplicate<00:03:15.939> it<00:03:16.180> shifty<00:03:16.659> to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
to it shift D to duplicate it shifty to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.500 
to it shift D to duplicate it shifty to
duplicate<00:03:17.200> once<00:03:17.439> again<00:03:18.030> duplicate<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
duplicate once again duplicate the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.550 
duplicate once again duplicate the
diffuse<00:03:19.930> no<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.939> despair<00:03:21.939> and<00:03:22.150> first<00:03:23.109> texture

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
diffuse no to despair and first texture

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.940 
diffuse no to despair and first texture
will<00:03:23.889> be<00:03:23.919> matte<00:03:24.700> texture<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:26.560> second

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
will be matte texture and the second

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.800 
will be matte texture and the second
will<00:03:27.099> be<00:03:27.129> just<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> separate<00:03:27.909> that<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.359> black

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
will be just to separate that a black

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.250 
will be just to separate that a black
and<00:03:28.959> white<00:03:29.109> image<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.889> drew<00:03:30.219> inking<00:03:30.669> and<00:03:31.260> this

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and white image I drew inking and this

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.379 
and white image I drew inking and this
will<00:03:32.500> separate<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.909> mat<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.719> the<00:03:35.109> rock<00:03:36.150> ok<00:03:37.150> I

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
will separate the mat and the rock ok I

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.949 
will separate the mat and the rock ok I
want<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.019> mix<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.769> shader<00:03:39.159> mix<00:03:39.849> shader'<00:03:40.150> put

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
want to mix it so shader mix shader' put

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.099 
want to mix it so shader mix shader' put
it<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.290> there

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
it in there

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.189 
it in there
let<00:03:44.109> put<00:03:44.889> this<00:03:45.370> invert<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:46.180> not<00:03:46.569> in<00:03:46.689> fact<00:03:46.930> or

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
let put this invert to not in fact or

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.009 
let put this invert to not in fact or
and<00:03:47.500> now<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.069> will<00:03:48.400> duplicate<00:03:48.969> your<00:03:49.359> GP<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
and now we will duplicate your GP and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.830 
and now we will duplicate your GP and
put<00:03:50.919> it<00:03:51.040> there<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.849> convert<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:52.719> a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
put it there to convert this into a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.649 
put it there to convert this into a
black<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.199> white<00:03:53.319> image<00:03:53.620> put<00:03:54.609> this<00:03:54.879> in<00:03:55.180> there

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
black and white image put this in there

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.939 
black and white image put this in there
and<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:58.180> will<00:03:58.509> see<00:03:58.900> what<00:03:59.199> our<00:03:59.379> rock<00:03:59.709> is

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
and now you will see what our rock is

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.429 
and now you will see what our rock is
looking<00:04:00.430> pretty<00:04:00.759> nice<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.979> it's<00:04:02.979> muddy<00:04:03.370> and

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
looking pretty nice and it's muddy and

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.249 
looking pretty nice and it's muddy and
this<00:04:05.439> was<00:04:05.680> my<00:04:05.889> tutorial<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.879> hope<00:04:07.449> you<00:04:07.509> liked<00:04:08.019> it
