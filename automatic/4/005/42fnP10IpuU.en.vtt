00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello girls welcome to your channel jamie 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.550
 lyrics today I have this look 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.559
 Super simple is a smoky brown 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.540
 and black and a few color lips I hope 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.970
 that you like let's start with the 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.310
 routine of always spending a prime &amp; 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.770
 of shadow all over our eyelid the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.960
 fixed and mobile we are going to do it with a 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.960
 flat brush and I'm using a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.460
 first of the cake brand and it's a tone 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.550
 skin 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.550
 Y 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 the palette that I will be using today is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 this visa of the collection my land 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 a little treat for all my friends 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.720
 Mexican women and we will use two colors 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 the first one who will be this brown cited what 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.150
 let's locate all our eyelid 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 mobile and then let's move it up 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.620
 we are going to blur it until we take it to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.360
 fixed eyelid 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 and that we will do with the help of a 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.399
 more chubby brochita 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.399
 i 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.060
 Y 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.250
 little by little we are going to increase the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.990
 shadow to have the exact pigmentation 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.690
 if you are asking me about your 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.940
 brushes are a few economic ones of the brand 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.360
 or bani and some of them are also from 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.360
 sign 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.590
 right away let's take our second 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.290
 color that is a matte black let's 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.020
 locate it very well first in the singing 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.000
 externally we are going to do it as if it were a 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.430
 of line as if we would be delineating 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.399
 with shadow and then let's move on to 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.899
 blur it this would be a smoked 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.899
 but in angular form 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.510
 I will not take this economic palette 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.820
 let's take the color vanilla mate 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 also and we're going to place it below 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 our eyebrows let's blur it very 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.220
 well so that all our shadows 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.220
 be very well degraded 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.550
 then we are going to remove the tei that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.920
 we have in the external singing and we are going to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.920
 correct all that area with a concealer 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.110
 let's move on to color our 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.870
 water line using this pencil 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.240
 the brand I saw her we're also going to give a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.430
 little bit of transvestism soil can be 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.060
 the part of the lower eyelid with the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.410
 first brown tone cited that we use 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.910
 today we are not going to be delineated 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.560
 so let's apply our 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.200
 false eyelashes then I will use 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.830
 this gel to admit is called has 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.650
 eyes and this golden glitter of mesut 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.590
 also and we're going to put it on everything 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.140
 our inner corner that is the area 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.540
 of the lacrimal 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.459
 in this mask that many ask me 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.490
 is the brand of people is super 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.410
 delgadito the applicator and we're going to 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.330
 put a little on our eyelashes 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.020
 lower to give a little bit of 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.020
 dramatics 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.410

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.400
