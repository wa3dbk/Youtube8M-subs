00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you know they need to get all the ducks

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.880 
you know they need to get all the ducks
in<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.829> row<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:40.110> create<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> standard

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in a row and have to create a standard

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880 
in a row and have to create a standard
so<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.299> eventually<00:01:42.720> trial<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> Jason

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so that we can eventually trial it Jason

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
so that we can eventually trial it Jason
we<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> works<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.899> we

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we want to see if it works can we can we

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.460 
we want to see if it works can we can we
attach<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
attach it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
attach it
this<00:01:46.770> goes<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> Sadler's<00:01:47.700> explain<00:01:48.210> why

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
this goes on to the Sadler's explain why

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
this goes on to the Sadler's explain why
don't<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> attach<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.890> then

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
don't you attach it on and then and then

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
don't you attach it on and then and then
do<00:01:50.159> what's<00:01:50.340> necessary

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
do what's necessary

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
do what's necessary
it<00:01:52.620> takes<00:01:53.130> about<00:01:53.220> 25<00:01:53.700> pounds<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:54.090> pressure<00:01:54.300> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it takes about 25 pounds of pressure to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.940 
it takes about 25 pounds of pressure to
release<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.590> actually<00:01:55.800> do<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.100> myself

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.790 

okay<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.700> wonderful<00:02:06.180> now<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.260> we<00:02:07.590> want<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
okay that's wonderful now if we want to

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.330 
okay that's wonderful now if we want to
release<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.430> do<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:11.130> quite

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
release it we just do that it's quite

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.410 
release it we just do that it's quite
noisy<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:14.100> know<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.640> think<00:02:14.850> there's<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> lot<00:02:15.300> of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
noisy you know I think there's a lot of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.880 
noisy you know I think there's a lot of
other<00:02:15.540> things<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.900> horses<00:02:16.140> minds<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.650> jockeys

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
other things on horses minds and jockeys

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.490 
other things on horses minds and jockeys
minds<00:02:17.100> when<00:02:17.340> they're<00:02:17.490> falling<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:19.260> nose

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
minds when they're falling so my nose

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.810 
minds when they're falling so my nose
shouldn't<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> problem

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
shouldn't be a problem

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.310 
shouldn't be a problem
now<00:02:21.090> obviously<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.900> get<00:02:22.110> knocked

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
now obviously if you get knocked

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.050 
now obviously if you get knocked
sideways<00:02:22.560> round<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.340> canal<00:02:23.610> turn<00:02:23.820> or

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
sideways round the canal turn or

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
sideways round the canal turn or
something<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:25.050> easy<00:02:25.320> how<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.370> think

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
something and how easy how do we think

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.430 
something and how easy how do we think
can<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:27.570> off<00:02:27.720> my<00:02:27.840> mistake

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
can it go off my mistake

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.260 
can it go off my mistake
well<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> takes<00:02:29.100> about<00:02:29.250> 25<00:02:29.760> pounds<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
well it takes about 25 pounds of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.760 
well it takes about 25 pounds of
pressure<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.750> take<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.020> off<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.350> as<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.590> said

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
pressure to take it off and as I said

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.860 
pressure to take it off and as I said
it's<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.040> successful<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> eventing

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's very successful in the eventing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.150 
it's very successful in the eventing
world<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.170> been<00:02:34.290> around<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.770> about<00:02:34.800> 3<00:02:35.130> years

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
world it's been around for about 3 years

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.550 
world it's been around for about 3 years
now<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.720> there's<00:02:36.720> very<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.080> cases<00:02:37.350> of

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
now and there's very little cases of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
now and there's very little cases of
that<00:02:37.680> happening<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.130> what<00:02:38.400> we've<00:02:38.580> done<00:02:38.730> for

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that happening but what we've done for

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.790 
that happening but what we've done for
that<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.360> case<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.750> does<00:02:39.930> happen<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.560> put<00:02:40.740> an

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
that in case it does happen is we put an

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.010 
that in case it does happen is we put an
actual<00:02:40.920> dump<00:02:41.250> valve<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.640> there<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:41.970> will

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
actual dump valve in there which will

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.620 
actual dump valve in there which will
just<00:02:43.020> take<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> off<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.250> it'll<00:02:44.790> deflate<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
just take it off so it'll deflate in

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.230 
just take it off so it'll deflate in
about<00:02:45.900> two<00:02:46.110> seconds<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.060> current<00:02:48.060> body

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
about two seconds the current body

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.520 
about two seconds the current body
protector<00:02:48.720> underneath<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.260> it's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
protector underneath because it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
protector underneath because it's
sitting<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> house<00:02:50.280> racing<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:51.209> really

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
sitting on the house racing it's really

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.790 
sitting on the house racing it's really
impressive<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.020> how<00:02:52.110> did<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.290> feel<00:02:52.530> when<00:02:52.590> it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
impressive and how did it feel when it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.509 
impressive and how did it feel when it
was<00:02:52.890> being<00:02:53.040> burn<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:55.190> sort<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.430> this
