means it's full and of course it goes

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.789 
means it's full and of course it goes
down<00:01:49.289> as<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> uses<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.609> battery<00:01:50.909> life<00:01:51.590> weight<00:01:52.590> of

the morning so which is pretty nice i
was<00:03:55.220> bugged<00:03:55.640> down<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.090> about<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.080> know

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
was bugged down to about like you know

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.110 
was bugged down to about like you know
ten<00:03:57.650> percent<00:03:57.980> at<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.160> point<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.970> it's

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
ten percent at that point but it's

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.449 
ten percent at that point but it's
pretty<00:03:59.390> nice<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.500> pre<00:04:01.010> affordable

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
pretty nice and it's pre affordable

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.690 
pretty nice and it's pre affordable
thing<00:04:02.360> one<00:04:02.690> thing<00:04:02.720> i<00:04:02.870> don't<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
thing one thing i don't like is the

an additional time to talk now if your

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.030 
an additional time to talk now if your
bag<00:04:30.120> access<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.750> battery<00:04:31.050> fully<00:04:31.410> dies<00:04:31.740> it

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
bag access the battery fully dies it

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.890 
bag access the battery fully dies it
will<00:04:32.070> charge<00:04:32.640> this<00:04:33.000> they<00:04:33.420> will<00:04:33.540> charge<00:04:33.750> your

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
will charge this they will charge your

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.360 
will charge this they will charge your
battery<00:04:34.230> but<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.530> wouldn't<00:04:34.830> try<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.070> all<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
battery but it wouldn't try it all the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.220 
battery but it wouldn't try it all the
way<00:04:35.460> because<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> math<00:04:36.480> 1800

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
way because you just do the math 1800

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.560 
way because you just do the math 1800
this<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:38.100> believe<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.700> twenty<00:04:39.360> five

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
this is I believe this is twenty five

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.510 
this is I believe this is twenty five
hundred<00:04:39.600> milliamps<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.890> could<00:04:41.340> be<00:04:41.400> wrong

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
hundred milliamps so I could be wrong

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.480 
hundred milliamps so I could be wrong
when<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.760> was<00:04:41.910> over<00:04:42.210> 2000<00:04:42.750> by<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> apps<00:04:43.050> anyway

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
when I was over 2000 by the apps anyway

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.070 
when I was over 2000 by the apps anyway
so<00:04:44.490> basically<00:04:44.910> you're<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.660> know<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.930> will

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
so basically you're you know it will

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.540 
so basically you're you know it will
fully<00:04:46.230> charged<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.830> but<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.160> will<00:04:47.250> still<00:04:47.400> give

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
fully charged it but it will still give

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.030 
fully charged it but it will still give
you<00:04:47.580> enough<00:04:47.910> juice<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.210> go<00:04:48.450> along<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.500> way<00:04:49.620> all

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
you enough juice to go along the way all

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.860 
you enough juice to go along the way all
the<00:04:50.340> way<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.910> is<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.090> very<00:04:51.270> good<00:04:51.360> case<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.810> do

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
the way this is a very good case I do

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.420 
the way this is a very good case I do
