00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
for the bell to break in and it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.920 
for the bell to break in and it's
sometimes<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.509> hard<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
sometimes it's just a little hard to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.430 
sometimes it's just a little hard to
latch<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.640> stiff<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:10.050> sure

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
latch because it's so stiff but I'm sure

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
latch because it's so stiff but I'm sure
I'll<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.099> once<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.030> worn<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'll be all right once it's worn in a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.059 
I'll be all right once it's worn in a
little

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
little

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.280 
little
that<00:02:13.219> after<00:02:13.879> i<00:02:13.909> got<00:02:14.090> done<00:02:14.150> squating<00:02:14.689> my<00:02:15.019> legs

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
that after i got done squating my legs

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.399 
that after i got done squating my legs
were<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.799> dead<00:02:16.249> and<00:02:16.640> i<00:02:17.329> really<00:02:18.019> wanted<00:02:18.260> to

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
were just dead and i really wanted to

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.520 
were just dead and i really wanted to
get<00:02:18.560> some<00:02:18.799> cats<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.090> i<00:02:20.359> decided<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.379> do

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
get some cats and so i decided to do

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.739 
get some cats and so i decided to do
some<00:02:21.769> calf<00:02:22.010> raises<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.849> slide<00:02:23.450> press

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
some calf raises on a slide press

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.709 
some calf raises on a slide press
machine<00:02:24.189> but<00:02:25.189> after<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.730> i<00:02:26.030> was<00:02:26.329> just<00:02:26.540> like

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
machine but after this i was just like

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.809 
machine but after this i was just like
man<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:27.469> just<00:02:27.709> probably<00:02:28.099> going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.489> do<00:02:28.609> some

man I'm just probably going to do some

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.220 
man I'm just probably going to do some
plyos<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.750> some<00:02:30.319> abs<00:02:30.560> now<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.989> not<00:02:32.989> lift

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
plyos and some abs now and not lift

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.220 
plyos and some abs now and not lift
anything<00:02:33.500> heavy<00:02:33.879> since<00:02:34.879> my<00:02:35.689> legs<00:02:35.930> were<00:02:36.049> just

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
anything heavy since my legs were just

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.860 
anything heavy since my legs were just
done<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:36.769> even<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.159> playas<00:02:37.579> killed<00:02:37.939> me<00:02:38.120> but

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
done and even the playas killed me but

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.199 
done and even the playas killed me but
you<00:02:39.079> guys<00:02:39.230> should<00:02:39.290> try<00:02:39.859> this<00:02:39.980> plyo<00:02:40.700> circuit

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you guys should try this plyo circuit

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.199 
you guys should try this plyo circuit
and<00:02:41.389> let<00:02:41.510> me<00:02:41.629> know<00:02:41.659> how<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.049> goes<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:43.579> consists

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
and let me know how it goes it consists

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.929 
and let me know how it goes it consists
of<00:02:44.359> three<00:02:44.689> exercises<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.829> first<00:02:46.069> one<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.400> a

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
of three exercises the first one is a

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.000 
of three exercises the first one is a
single<00:02:47.359> leg<00:02:47.540> squat<00:02:47.900> my<00:02:48.349> gym<00:02:48.560> has<00:02:48.769> these

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
single leg squat my gym has these

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
single leg squat my gym has these
gliders<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.849> use<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.659> I<00:02:51.169> think<00:02:51.409> it's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
gliders that I use and I think it's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.399 
gliders that I use and I think it's
actually<00:02:51.739> for<00:02:52.280> moving<00:02:52.549> furniture<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.199> use

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
actually for moving furniture but I use

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.920 
actually for moving furniture but I use
those<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.829> glide<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.459> out<00:02:55.669> and<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.780> could

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
those to glide in and out and you could

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.099 
those to glide in and out and you could
even<00:02:56.959> use<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.439> towel<00:02:57.799> if<00:02:58.340> you're<00:02:58.669> at<00:02:58.790> home<00:02:59.109> but

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
even use a towel if you're at home but

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.020 
even use a towel if you're at home but
these<00:03:00.590> are<00:03:00.799> really<00:03:00.919> good<00:03:01.219> for<00:03:01.519> your<00:03:01.639> inner<00:03:01.849> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
these are really good for your inner and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.869 
these are really good for your inner and
outer<00:03:02.150> thighs<00:03:02.419> quads<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> glutes<00:03:04.099> then<00:03:04.760> I

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
outer thighs quads and glutes then I

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.789 
outer thighs quads and glutes then I
moved<00:03:05.090> on<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.389> jumping<00:03:05.750> squats<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.379> I<00:03:06.590> try<00:03:06.769> to

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
moved on to jumping squats and I try to

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.309 
moved on to jumping squats and I try to
be<00:03:06.949> very<00:03:06.980> explosive<00:03:07.760> with<00:03:08.449> this<00:03:08.629> movement<00:03:08.870> I

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
be very explosive with this movement I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.920 
be very explosive with this movement I
try<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.069> jump<00:03:10.400> as<00:03:10.549> high<00:03:10.609> as<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.719> I<00:03:11.870> know

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
try to jump as high as I can and I know

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.539 
try to jump as high as I can and I know
sometimes<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.620> really<00:03:12.739> hard<00:03:12.889> when<00:03:13.219> you're

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
sometimes it's really hard when you're

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.020 
sometimes it's really hard when you're
tired<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.290> lastly<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.709> did<00:03:16.340> alternating

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
tired and lastly I did alternating

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.210 
tired and lastly I did alternating
jumping<00:03:17.419> lunges<00:03:17.569> these<00:03:18.409> are<00:03:18.560> one<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.799> my

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
jumping lunges these are one of my

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.550 
jumping lunges these are one of my
favorite<00:03:19.699> workouts<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.569> it's<00:03:20.870> tricky<00:03:21.109> at

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
favorite workouts but it's tricky at

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.559 
favorite workouts but it's tricky at
first<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.250> get<00:03:22.370> used<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.269> requires

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
first to get used to because it requires

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.659 
first to get used to because it requires
a<00:03:23.689> lot<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.900> balance<00:03:24.379> and<00:03:24.590> coordination<00:03:24.739> but

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
a lot of balance and coordination but

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.999 
a lot of balance and coordination but
once<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:25.970> get<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.209> hang<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.509> it<00:03:26.659> it's<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.829> a

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
once you get the hang of it it's it's a

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.249 
once you get the hang of it it's it's a
really<00:03:28.310> good<00:03:28.669> exercise<00:03:29.509> to<00:03:29.659> do<00:03:29.810> because<00:03:29.989> it

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:30.259 
really good exercise to do because it

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.890 
really good exercise to do because it
gives<00:03:30.409> you<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> really<00:03:30.949> good<00:03:31.220> leg<00:03:31.459> burned<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.090> did

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
gives you a really good leg burned I did

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.830 
gives you a really good leg burned I did
10<00:03:33.169> to<00:03:33.319> 12<00:03:33.620> reps<00:03:33.979> each<00:03:34.250> exercise<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.479> three

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
10 to 12 reps each exercise and three

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.170 
10 to 12 reps each exercise and three
circuits<00:03:36.319> I<00:03:36.590> took<00:03:36.919> about<00:03:37.189> 30<00:03:37.459> seconds<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:38.030> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
circuits I took about 30 seconds to a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.619 
circuits I took about 30 seconds to a
minute<00:03:38.269> break<00:03:38.780> between<00:03:39.019> each<00:03:39.530> circuits<00:03:40.099> and

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
minute break between each circuits and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.490 
minute break between each circuits and
fellows<00:03:42.939> biometrics<00:03:43.939> are<00:03:44.150> not<00:03:44.810> only<00:03:45.290> for

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
fellows biometrics are not only for

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.589 
fellows biometrics are not only for
women<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.189> try<00:03:46.459> out<00:03:46.639> this<00:03:46.849> circuit<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.389> let<00:03:47.479> me

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
women so try out this circuit and let me

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.929 
women so try out this circuit and let me
know<00:03:47.750> if<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.019> can<00:03:48.169> hang<00:03:48.379> after<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.669> playa

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
know if you can hang after that playa

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.999 
know if you can hang after that playa
larga<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.509> was<00:03:50.689> just<00:03:50.870> done<00:03:51.439> I<00:03:51.470> didn't<00:03:51.859> want<00:03:51.979> to

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.009 
larga I was just done I didn't want to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.219 
larga I was just done I didn't want to
be<00:03:52.129> on<00:03:52.250> my<00:03:52.370> feet<00:03:52.519> anymore<00:03:52.699> so<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:53.629> decided<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.139> do
