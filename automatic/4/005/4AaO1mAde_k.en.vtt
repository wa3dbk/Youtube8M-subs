00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.040
 of mega good blond pokemon we keep 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.000
 capturing legendary and today we play 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.809
 capture to resist worth to go for 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.710
 king steel we have to fly to the route 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.670
 120 what to see what is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.390
 120 to see if I remember where it is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.910
 ok I think it's around here I feel 19 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.500
 ok this is this and we have to carry 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.149
 a pokémon with flight that our case 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 well, we carry arraiza 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.870
 that takes flight to open the cave goes 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.390
 far we need flight 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.040
 ok and king steel is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 let's put the bike 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.280
 and let's see and see how you see something 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 to bug good over here yes that 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.790
 I should have fought all 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.070
 trainers so this does not scare me 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.570
 this is the beautiful route at night that the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.900
 he did two and three the other day and you liked it 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.900
 much 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.750
 how do you look at an absurdity out there 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.520
 ok and now you have to go more than me 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.439
 own 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 now you have to go here for the 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.570
 left there will be a detour here 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.090
 ok and it will be above I say yes 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.340
 well, I had to leave something 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.229
 nothing happens I think against all those 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 coaches I have already fought but good 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.830
 I would not put my hand on fire either 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.009
 so if someone challenges us then nothing 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.460
 we will overcome quickly and it is already not happening 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.460
 nothing 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.530
 We have already fought, it is worth, we are here 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.350
 in front of the register cave I'm going to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.720
 get off the bikes 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 ok you have to read the inscription 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.200
 go to the center of the room that will be 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.730
 more or less this 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.849
 and here 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 use flight no, this is not the center 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.180
 From the living room 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.490
 it will be this same good one should look for the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.370
 Center of the room is worth 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.610
 and I had gone a little way towards 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.910
 down in your grandfather and the cave is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.910
 opens 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.130
 let's see here is record as 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.020
 we are always going to keep before him for 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.020
 so that we do not troll the game 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.379
 I'll just see if I get it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.020
 the power capture 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.680
 can capture at level 2 with another and with 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.680
 the other lira 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 is worth a capture power at level 2 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.020
 it takes me one arrives 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.640
 Well I do not know if it comes to me now it's worth it now 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.300
 that I have received a power capture level 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.300
 2 ok 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.910
 so that it does not make us so heavy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.480
 so now we are going to talk to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.480
 to resist 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 and here we have it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.920
 I like the three without liking that I do not 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.700
 I like it but good of the three is the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.700
 what I like the most 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.040
 let's see the first thing to smooth it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.510
 there is 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.110
 very well 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.810
 and well this is what we are going to throw 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.480
 some force 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.440
 because if not with false smack we can 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.440
 throw us until tomorrow 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.590
 well it is paralyzed and you can not 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.030
 move I will pull the other force that to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.540
 not be that the critical soul that I hope not 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.540
 do what 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.060
 do not kill uf 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.520
 I have seen restarting 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.919
 ok and now it is very weak but 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.970
 I want to leave it to a ps worth so 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.970
 let's make him false cakes 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.600
 and has stayed 1 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.410
 is 1 and paralyzed is the time to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.250
 start throwing a drink the 99 then 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.150
 if we get to 79 and no and it has not 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.740
 captured to be with the turns 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.320
 you may never get to use them 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.129
 turn it was already seemed to me a lot 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.309
 ask 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.839
 well this will show all the time but 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.839
 well nothing should happen 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.560
 let's add 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.380
 come mind 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.980
 it's good that I have these two 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.980
 little brothers and one is worth pure and no more 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.810
 I already have your two brothers record 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.520
 pack that then you will have to capture the 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.520
 older brother to the cousin of zumosol 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.270
 we go 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.270
 the mother has passed me 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.350
 I say I'm not going to hit you anymore 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.210
 I'm just going to capture 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.950
 as I always say by the good or by 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.950
 the bad ones get in why you're going 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.279
 come 1 2 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.780
 hello very easy 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.919
 well we have captured very easily 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.919
 to resist 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.400
 king 471 good yes 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.780

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.700
 pokémon iron 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.620
 no metal hardness that exceeds the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.360
 registration body that looks like 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.180
 be hollow nobody knows what is 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.900
 feed this pokemon from the air I do not want 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.400
 put a nickname that does not need it 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.729
 voucher has been transferred to box 3 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.350
 and let's see it to see how it has 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.849
 out surely worse than the 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.749
 demon but good 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.749

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.230

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.040
 best in the world to resist the pineapple 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.540

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.130
 that there is also how I am half bad 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.100
