00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.709
 so dear people today a small contribution 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.880
 on the topic lost places photography i 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.560
 you would be here with his 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.860
 camera on the tripod and then goes 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.860
 really going on 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.930
 so dominate as I said today on the subject 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.690
 post best off 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.240
 we are on a relatively large scale 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.440
 military complex also mallorca 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.480
 As you can see how should I be the first 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.239
 here have been awkward the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.739
 last one of my most important tips 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.010
 on the subject space and I know makes 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.200
 fun going to do the illegal opponent 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.450
 only the bus really half way 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.660
 obviously is allowed otherwise 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.129
 beginning of a peace process 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 and there is the possibility with 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.990
 Owners to talk to us ready me 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.910
 I want to give it that one then 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.100
 just a camera bag that needs 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.960
 one in each case bright 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.690
 bright lenses I have here 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.430
 my bag a 24 70 28 and I have 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.899
 also the rooms that she despises 200 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.680
 business does not have the whole day 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.690
 once needed 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.630
 at least not for the one the best 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.670
 from api for that many people are yes 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.610
 even from afar is the construction 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.940
 completely on a telezoom but just say 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.340
 No 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.580
 what should be needed every case is one 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.510
 Wide angle are always there because the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.240
 just seems bigger and deeper if you 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.590
 Whatever we see can be there 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.549
 and of course that's bad in the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.470
 camera a bit higher, why 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.750
 that's what it's like in buildings 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.780
 does not even smell like you can see 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 tripod is not there has just reason 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.200
 this is spacious here when you are there 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 Not 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.590
 how much does he have to run? 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 not behind and then I do 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.250
 I'm sure it's kind of like that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.799
 above and diverse lot today have with 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 1600 and 2002 works there as well 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.920
 was pitch black 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 if it is much too dark then 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 you can still use the following 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.530
 I have here as a small m7 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.550
 mediated but we know the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.769
 have lamp 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.060
 they made many ugly and therefore 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.250
 can one run out on eur 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.880
 especially the focus but help sharp 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.019
 if that naturally accompanies 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.220
 I would take the takeaway from the tripod 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.930
 not necessarily recommend 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.069
 but you can not start from it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 because otherwise, of course, is relative 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.450
 hard and I have the whole thing 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.440
 time with rum and the question is how much 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.150
 use south 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.470
 I often do that too 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.730
 Exposure series simply out of hand 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.319
 around the art strong contrast 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 to balance differences and 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.440
 especially of the misfortune cases is the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.940
 have much smaller rooms as well as 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.019
 Part of the case was in each case 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.019
 case engaged by a further 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.299
 orderly then just a lot of 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.730
 to clear the room and also one 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.049
 to achieve a proper perspective 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.350
 then you would always pay attention 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.170
 goes with the set if your son still 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.209
 places come in and you 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.150
 friend 's ankle or whatever 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.340
 who wants to start here from the world 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.569
 wanting to rotting 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.489
 nobody 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.639
 with two or four of a small group 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.480
 make it more fun and fun 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.099
 second 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.950
 if something happens so halfway 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.230
 secured and since these are the first please 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.900
 not reach of course but also 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.250
 me but I remember 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.200
 please leave these places as well as them 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.870
 found has thrown a munich 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 accept the people again with nevertheless 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.219
 others want to take pictures or just 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.930
 look at the part and do it 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.639
 It just makes sense if it looks like it 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.530
 I have not found any now 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.790
 nastier and tidy up but me 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.889
 did not throw so green what 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.549
 now remains here and posterity here 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:57.040
 The terrain will get that now 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.810
 come pictures here from the heart and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.409
 financed from other playstation 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.019
 I wish you much fun remark 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.389
 data of the sealing data the so on 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.219
 stand a picture and now not euro 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.219
 will be here once in the complex
