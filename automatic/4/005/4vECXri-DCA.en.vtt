now I'm gonna pull up my assignment

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.949 
now I'm gonna pull up my assignment
requirements<00:03:29.909> which<00:03:30.909> I<00:03:31.419> think<00:03:31.840> I

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
requirements which I think I

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.759 
requirements which I think I
accidentally<00:03:34.319> but<00:03:35.319> okay

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
accidentally but okay

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.399 
accidentally but okay
so<00:03:35.949> be<00:03:36.519> sure<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.790> check<00:03:36.909> your<00:03:37.479> size

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
so be sure to check your size

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.009 
so be sure to check your size
requirements<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.359> size<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.959> I

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
requirements what the size is and I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.229 
requirements what the size is and I
believe<00:03:41.379> I'm<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> little<00:03:42.069> bit<00:03:42.220> over<00:03:42.609> on<00:03:42.790> my<00:03:42.970> size

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
believe I'm a little bit over on my size

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.349 
believe I'm a little bit over on my size
12<00:03:43.900> 69<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.099> this<00:03:45.250> image<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.699> a<00:03:45.729> little<00:03:45.819> too

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
12 69 so this image is a little too

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.149 
12 69 so this image is a little too
large<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:47.049> should<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.849> think<00:03:49.389> just<00:03:50.199> 1200<00:03:50.919> I

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
large it should be I think just 1200 I

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.960 
large it should be I think just 1200 I
believe<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.209> 750<00:03:53.139> by<00:03:53.409> 1200<00:03:54.189> for<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.549> short

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
believe it's 750 by 1200 for the short

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.770 
believe it's 750 by 1200 for the short
side<00:03:55.299> um<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.849> is<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> bit<00:03:58.329> little<00:03:58.569> bit

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
side um so this is a bit little bit

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.610 
side um so this is a bit little bit
large<00:03:59.169> so<00:03:59.969> what<00:04:00.969> you<00:04:01.060> want<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.329> do<00:04:01.509> then<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:02.259> you

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
large so what you want to do then if you

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.670 
large so what you want to do then if you
have<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.799> really<00:04:03.159> large<00:04:03.370> image<00:04:03.729> is<00:04:07.379> come<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.590> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
have a really large image is come to the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.069 
have a really large image is come to the
DPI<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.609> little<00:04:12.909> bit<00:04:13.030> bigger<00:04:13.299> than

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
DPI and this is a little bit bigger than

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.589 
DPI and this is a little bit bigger than
4x6<00:04:14.949> so<00:04:15.159> I<00:04:15.189> come<00:04:15.639> in<00:04:15.669> here<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.030> maybe<00:04:16.299> make

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
4x6 so I come in here and maybe make

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.689 
4x6 so I come in here and maybe make
this<00:04:17.009> um<00:04:20.579> 200

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
this um 200

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:46.980 
this um 200
and<00:04:22.849> then<00:04:23.240> hitscan

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.720 

okay<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.350> now<00:04:48.500> this<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.710> now<00:04:49.040> within<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.550> size

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
okay so now this is now within the size

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.490 
okay so now this is now within the size
requirements<00:04:50.570> um<00:04:51.790> we<00:04:52.790> have<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.180> here

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500
