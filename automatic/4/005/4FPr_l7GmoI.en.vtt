00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
first place well obviously that was

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.660 
first place well obviously that was
never<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.530> happen

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

you<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.149> we're<00:00:48.360> obviously<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.200> lose

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

every<00:00:49.680> game<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.070> Newcastle<00:00:50.340> win<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.449> down

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
every game and Newcastle win all so down

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.360 
every game and Newcastle win all so down
mind<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> meant<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.190> game

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
mind and that meant that in this game

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.229 
mind and that meant that in this game
against<00:00:53.640> Spurs

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
against Spurs

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.549 
against Spurs
even<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.660> would<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.840> lost<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
even if we would have lost really we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
even if we would have lost really we
probably<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.219> leave<00:00:56.430> title<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.030> one

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
probably would one leave title but one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
probably would one leave title but one
point<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:58.050> four<00:00:58.440> games<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.699> would

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
point from four games was all we would

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700 
point from four games was all we would
have<00:00:59.969> needed<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.510> even<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.350> didn't<00:01:01.590> get

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have needed and even if we didn't get

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.080 
have needed and even if we didn't get
that<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:02.070> results<00:01:02.550> minute<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.879> could<00:01:03.000> have

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that other results minute we could have

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.390

even so with that in mind it would mean

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.539

it a chance for my year my young players
to<00:03:53.819> step<00:03:54.150> up<00:03:54.329> really<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.900> show<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.799> they<00:03:56.250> can

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
to step up really and show that they can

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800
