00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670 
looks like in the box when you receive
it<00:00:14.540> first<00:00:15.540> thing<00:00:15.690> you'll<00:00:15.839> notice<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it first thing you'll notice is that it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.099 
it first thing you'll notice is that it
is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> two-tone<00:00:17.460> case<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> also<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.449> two-piece

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
is a two-tone case and also a two-piece

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.590 
is a two-tone case and also a two-piece
case<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.680> part<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.970> metal

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
case this part right here this metal

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.679 
case this part right here this metal
part<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.890> comes<00:00:23.279> off<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.970> most<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
part is actually comes off so most of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.960 
part is actually comes off so most of
the<00:00:24.750> cases<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.320> spigen<00:00:25.769> has<00:00:25.920> our<00:00:26.250> two<00:00:26.580> pieces

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the cases that spigen has our two pieces

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.570 
the cases that spigen has our two pieces
as<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:28.199> case<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.740> Neo<00:00:29.099> Hybrid<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
as you see this case the Neo Hybrid that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
as you see this case the Neo Hybrid that
argued<00:00:30.029> few<00:00:30.539> weeks<00:00:30.720> ago<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.500> sure<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> check

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
argued few weeks ago be sure to check

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.350 
argued few weeks ago be sure to check
that<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> haven't<00:00:32.430> already<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:33.180> was

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
that out if you haven't already it was

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
that out if you haven't already it was
also<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> pieces<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.260> most<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> their<00:00:34.860> cases

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
also to pieces and most of their cases

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.030 
also to pieces and most of their cases
are<00:00:35.510> two<00:00:36.510> piece<00:00:36.750> cases<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.770> like

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
are two piece cases which I really like

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.069 
are two piece cases which I really like
because<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.640> always<00:00:38.790> means<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.809> it's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
because that always means that it's

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
because that always means that it's
going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> hard<00:00:40.950> shell<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> soft

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
going to be a hard shell with a soft

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to be a hard shell with a soft
shell<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> inside<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> mean<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
shell on the inside what I mean is that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
shell on the inside what I mean is that
it<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.250> protect<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.730> phone<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> inside

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it will protect your phone on the inside

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
it will protect your phone on the inside
this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> soft<00:00:46.170> rubber<00:00:46.579> shell<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:47.850> soft

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this is a soft rubber shell or soft

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
this is a soft rubber shell or soft
rubber<00:00:48.620> finish<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.190> also

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
rubber finish right there and you also

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.040 
rubber finish right there and you also
have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> hard<00:00:50.969> shell<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> outside<00:00:51.570> which

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
have a hard shell on the outside which

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
have a hard shell on the outside which
protects<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> from<00:00:52.590> falls<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.309> damage<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
protects it from falls and damage and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.209 
protects it from falls and damage and
things<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.440> comes<00:00:55.680> off<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
things like that so this comes off but I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
things like that so this comes off but I
really<00:00:56.579> don't<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.420> taking<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really don't see a need and taking it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
really don't see a need and taking it
off<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.789> easy<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
off at all because it's really easy to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
off at all because it's really easy to
put<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.420> without<00:01:01.410> taking<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> off<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.579> just

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
put on without taking it off so I'm just

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.860 
put on without taking it off so I'm just
go<00:01:02.850> ahead<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.030> show<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> looks<00:01:03.600> like

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
go ahead and show you what it looks like

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.140 
go ahead and show you what it looks like
when<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.250> fact<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:07.850> make<00:01:08.850> sure<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.060> get

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
when it is in fact off make sure you get

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
when it is in fact off make sure you get
the<00:01:09.299> buttons<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> only<00:01:10.490> tough

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the buttons out of this the only tough

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.080 
the buttons out of this the only tough
part<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.970> from

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
part about that and then just go from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
part about that and then just go from
the<00:01:15.240> bottom<00:01:15.710> there<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.159> sounded<00:01:17.400> like

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the bottom there you go it sounded like

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
the bottom there you go it sounded like
a<00:01:17.549> ripped<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> didn't<00:01:18.659> just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
a ripped right there but it didn't just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
a ripped right there but it didn't just
sounds<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
sounds like that all the time so as you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
sounds like that all the time so as you
see<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.450> two<00:01:21.630> buttons<00:01:21.930> right

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
see there are actually two buttons right

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
see there are actually two buttons right
there<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.439> never<00:01:22.470> figured<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.130> why<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
there which I never figured out why and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
there which I never figured out why and
they<00:01:23.850> never<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.270> stated<00:01:25.200> why<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they never actually stated why that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
they never actually stated why that
second<00:01:25.890> buttons<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:27.240> maybe<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
second buttons there but maybe I just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
second buttons there but maybe I just
had<00:01:27.810> something<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> design<00:01:28.740> now

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
had something to do with the design now

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
had something to do with the design now
on<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> inside<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.990> slim

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on the inside you will have your slim

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.859 
on the inside you will have your slim
armor<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> I'll<00:01:32.009> show<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.869> authentication

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

okay<00:03:03.350> there<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.530> go<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.250> there<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.330> case

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
okay there we go and there is the case

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.890 
okay there we go and there is the case
on<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.650> very<00:03:07.250> well<00:03:07.550> design<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> really<00:03:08.270> liked<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
on a very well design I really liked the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.540 
on a very well design I really liked the
design<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:09.980> case<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.430> actually

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
design of this case and it actually

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.479 
design of this case and it actually
protects<00:03:11.030> very<00:03:11.480> well<00:03:11.780> from<00:03:12.590> Falls<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.250> dust

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
protects very well from Falls and dust

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.370 
protects very well from Falls and dust
and<00:03:13.790> things<00:03:13.910> like<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.090> one<00:03:14.720> thing<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.020> did<00:03:15.170> not

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and things like that one thing I did not

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.440 
and things like that one thing I did not
like<00:03:15.680> though<00:03:15.920> about<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.370> was<00:03:16.940> as<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.299> see

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
like though about this was as you see

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.820 
like though about this was as you see
you<00:03:17.540> can<00:03:17.690> kind<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.989> see<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.380> bottom<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
you can kind of see the bottom of the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.710 
you can kind of see the bottom of the
phone<00:03:19.040> from<00:03:19.220> there<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:20.360> doesn't<00:03:20.630> actually

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
phone from there it doesn't actually

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.420 
phone from there it doesn't actually
cover<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.350> bezel<00:03:21.650> as<00:03:21.769> much<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.190> would<00:03:22.250> like

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
cover the bezel as much as I would like

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.710 
cover the bezel as much as I would like
it<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.940> only<00:03:23.090> reason<00:03:23.299> i<00:03:23.360> say<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
it to the only reason i say that is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.930 
it to the only reason i say that is
because<00:03:23.810> sometimes<00:03:24.350> lint<00:03:24.709> from<00:03:24.980> your<00:03:25.190> from

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
because sometimes lint from your from

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.370 
because sometimes lint from your from
your<00:03:25.970> pockets<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.630> gets<00:03:26.750> down<00:03:26.959> into<00:03:27.170> those

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
your pockets it gets down into those

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.259 
your pockets it gets down into those
cracks<00:03:27.769> right<00:03:28.070> there<00:03:28.310> which<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.180> had

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
cracks right there which I just had

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.150 
cracks right there which I just had
recently<00:03:29.630> had<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.870> clean<00:03:30.049> out<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.799> as<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.980> see

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
recently had to clean out so as you see

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.670 
recently had to clean out so as you see
Oh<00:03:31.400> long<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.810> gives<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.140> mean<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.470> gives<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
Oh long it gives you I mean it gives you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.039 
Oh long it gives you I mean it gives you
fool<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.610> mean<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.180> fully<00:03:35.360> exposed<00:03:35.720> screen

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
fool I mean it's fully exposed screen

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.180 
fool I mean it's fully exposed screen
fully<00:03:36.320> exposed<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.799> everything<00:03:37.100> but

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
fully exposed and everything but

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.710 
fully exposed and everything but
sometimes<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.670> don't<00:03:37.820> like<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.209> as<00:03:38.330> much<00:03:38.480> as<00:03:38.510> i

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
sometimes I don't like that as much as i

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.229 
sometimes I don't like that as much as i
would<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.950> have<00:03:40.100> just<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.209> it

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
would just to have just to have it

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.729 
would just to have just to have it
covered<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:41.989> when<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.290> doesn't<00:03:42.470> get<00:03:42.650> in

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
covered so that when it doesn't get in

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.690 
covered so that when it doesn't get in
there<00:03:42.860> but<00:03:43.010> that's<00:03:43.070> my<00:03:43.250> personal<00:03:43.610> opinion

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
there but that's my personal opinion

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.190 
there but that's my personal opinion
again<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.360> probably<00:03:44.600> not<00:03:44.750> going<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.019> make

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
again that's probably not going to make

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.690 
again that's probably not going to make
you<00:03:45.440> say<00:03:45.709> i'm<00:03:45.829> not<00:03:45.980> going<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> buy<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.340> case

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
you say i'm not going to buy this case

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300 
you say i'm not going to buy this case
just<00:03:46.730> because<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:48.290> as<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.769> see<00:03:48.920> it

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just because of that but as you see it

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.210 
just because of that but as you see it
does<00:03:49.790> leave<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.690> fully<00:03:51.079> exposed<00:03:51.500> all<00:03:51.829> around

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
does leave that fully exposed all around

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.500 
does leave that fully exposed all around
so<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.519> kind<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.700> looks<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:52.940> your<00:03:53.120> cases<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
so it kind of looks like your cases and

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.810 
so it kind of looks like your cases and
even<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.019> all<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> way<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.640> case

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
even in all the way it's not in the case

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.180 
even in all the way it's not in the case
all<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.060> way<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.450> actually<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:57.829> let's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
all the way but it actually is so let's

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.890 
all the way but it actually is so let's
go<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.489> take<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.760> look<00:03:58.790> around<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.420> case<00:03:59.630> of

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
go and take a look around the case of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.560 
go and take a look around the case of
course<00:04:00.140> we<00:04:00.290> have<00:04:00.500> our<00:04:01.090> we<00:04:02.090> have<00:04:02.209> our<00:04:02.329> volume

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
course we have our we have our volume

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.530 
course we have our we have our volume

whatever<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.900> use<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.560> that's<00:04:07.370> a

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
whatever you use it for and that's a

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.150 
whatever you use it for and that's a

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
really get to see the gunmetal color way

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.130 
really get to see the gunmetal color way
of<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.120> really<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.390> cool<00:04:38.480> two-tone

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
of this and it's really a cool two-tone

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.050 
of this and it's really a cool two-tone
case<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.560> really<00:04:39.800> like<00:04:39.950> two<00:04:40.130> tone<00:04:40.340> cases<00:04:40.760> I

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
case I really like two tone cases I

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.940 
case I really like two tone cases I
don't<00:04:41.570> like<00:04:41.600> cases<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.170> are<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.740> color

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
don't like cases that are just one color

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.340 
don't like cases that are just one color
it's<00:04:43.280> really<00:04:43.670> boring<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.060> me<00:04:44.210> hum<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.140> says

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
it's really boring to me hum but it says

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.500 
it's really boring to me hum but it says
slim<00:04:45.650> armor<00:04:45.830> right<00:04:46.130> there<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.580> course<00:04:46.850> your

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
slim armor right there of course your

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.170 
slim armor right there of course your
camera<00:04:48.110> cut<00:04:49.040> out<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.400> perfect<00:04:49.820> cutouts

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
camera cut out for that perfect cutouts

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.700 
camera cut out for that perfect cutouts
for<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.480> no<00:04:50.690> issue<00:04:50.900> there<00:04:51.080> another<00:04:51.500> thing

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
for that no issue there another thing

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.500 
for that no issue there another thing
about<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:51.920> case<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:53.150> probably

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
about this case is that it is probably

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.960 
about this case is that it is probably
the<00:04:53.720> easiest<00:04:54.200> case<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.920> take<00:04:55.130> off<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.700> put<00:04:55.850> on

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
the easiest case to take off and put on

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.510 
the easiest case to take off and put on
that<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.780> have<00:04:56.960> ever<00:04:57.140> used<00:04:57.260> so<00:04:57.770> let<00:04:58.160> me<00:04:58.250> show<00:04:58.490> you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
that I have ever used so let me show you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.890 
that I have ever used so let me show you
i'm<00:04:58.640> going<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:58.820> try<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.940> make<00:04:59.360> this<00:04:59.480> simple

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
i'm going to try to make this simple

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.660 
i'm going to try to make this simple
look<00:05:00.320> at<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.510> really<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:02.990> easy<00:05:03.670> to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
look at that this is really that easy to

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.670 
look at that this is really that easy to
come<00:05:04.790> out<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.060> case<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.570> that's<00:05:06.380> not<00:05:06.620> a

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
come out of the case and that's not a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.380 
come out of the case and that's not a
bad<00:05:06.950> thing<00:05:06.980> either<00:05:07.220> because<00:05:07.730> some<00:05:08.150> people

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
bad thing either because some people

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.000 
bad thing either because some people
will<00:05:08.480> probably<00:05:08.600> say<00:05:08.930> well<00:05:09.230> it's<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.560> easy<00:05:09.860> to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
will probably say well it's that easy to

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.260 
will probably say well it's that easy to
come<00:05:10.190> out<00:05:10.340> then<00:05:10.520> when<00:05:10.730> you're<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:10.970> trying<00:05:11.180> to

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
come out then when you're just trying to

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.540 
come out then when you're just trying to
pull<00:05:11.420> it<00:05:11.510> out<00:05:11.600> of<00:05:11.840> your<00:05:12.410> of<00:05:12.920> your<00:05:13.070> pocket<00:05:13.430> and

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
pull it out of your of your pocket and

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.070 
pull it out of your of your pocket and
that's<00:05:13.940> not<00:05:14.150> actually<00:05:14.330> true<00:05:14.510> i<00:05:14.660> haven't<00:05:14.990> had

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
that's not actually true i haven't had

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.810 
that's not actually true i haven't had
it<00:05:15.200> i<00:05:15.230> haven't<00:05:15.680> had<00:05:15.740> an<00:05:15.890> issue<00:05:15.980> with<00:05:16.130> that<00:05:16.400> at

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
it i haven't had an issue with that at

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.140 
it i haven't had an issue with that at
all<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:18.740> mean<00:05:19.220> just<00:05:19.460> have<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.700> force<00:05:20.000> it

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
all so I mean just have to force it

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.730 
all so I mean just have to force it
really<00:05:20.420> it's<00:05:20.630> not<00:05:20.780> really<00:05:20.840> it's<00:05:21.080> not<00:05:21.260> forcing

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
really it's not really it's not forcing

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.990 
really it's not really it's not forcing
it<00:05:21.800> but<00:05:21.980> it's<00:05:22.100> like<00:05:22.130> it's<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.580> at<00:05:22.700> a<00:05:22.730> perfect

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
it but it's like it's just at a perfect

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.310 
it but it's like it's just at a perfect
point<00:05:23.360> right<00:05:23.570> here<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:23.990> when<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.140> pull

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
point right here so that when you pull

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.870 
point right here so that when you pull
it<00:05:24.380> out<00:05:24.470> of<00:05:24.530> your<00:05:24.590> pocket<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:25.460> won't<00:05:25.700> actually

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
it out of your pocket it won't actually

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.060 
it out of your pocket it won't actually
come<00:05:26.870> off<00:05:26.990> at<00:05:27.170> least<00:05:27.320> not<00:05:27.500> for<00:05:27.650> me<00:05:27.770> i<00:05:27.800> mean

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
come off at least not for me i mean

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.170 
come off at least not for me i mean
there's<00:05:28.280> people<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.550> have<00:05:28.730> issues<00:05:29.030> like

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
there's people that have issues like

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.180 
there's people that have issues like
that<00:05:29.390> with<00:05:29.870> every<00:05:30.170> case<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:30.740> i'm<00:05:30.860> not<00:05:30.980> going<00:05:31.130> to

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
that with every case so i'm not going to

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.010 
that with every case so i'm not going to
say<00:05:31.310> it's<00:05:31.430> not<00:05:31.550> going<00:05:31.670> to<00:05:31.760> happen<00:05:31.930> but<00:05:32.930> it

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
say it's not going to happen but it

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.020 
say it's not going to happen but it
definitely<00:05:33.170> has<00:05:33.440> not<00:05:33.590> happened<00:05:33.710> for<00:05:34.130> me<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:34.820> it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
definitely has not happened for me so it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.510 
definitely has not happened for me so it
is<00:05:35.150> very<00:05:35.450> very<00:05:35.900> simple<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.380> take<00:05:36.560> off<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:37.010> put

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
is very very simple to take off and put

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.310 
is very very simple to take off and put
back<00:05:37.670> on<00:05:37.910> as<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.390> saw<00:05:38.570> i<00:05:38.600> did<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:38.990> within<00:05:39.140> a

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
back on as you saw i did it within a

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.090 
back on as you saw i did it within a
matter<00:05:39.500> of<00:05:39.620> seconds<00:05:41.080> okay<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.350> then<00:05:42.680> just<00:05:42.710> put

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
matter of seconds okay and then just put

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.970 
matter of seconds okay and then just put
it<00:05:43.190> right<00:05:43.220> back<00:05:43.490> on<00:05:43.669> there<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.780> got<00:05:44.930> done<00:05:45.290> and

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
it right back on there you got done and

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.190 
it right back on there you got done and
it's<00:05:46.160> fully<00:05:46.669> protected<00:05:47.210> nothing<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:48.050> worry

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
it's fully protected nothing to worry

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.659 
it's fully protected nothing to worry
about<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.470> probably<00:05:48.860> thinking<00:05:49.100> yourself<00:05:49.460> man

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
about a probably thinking yourself man

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.070 
about a probably thinking yourself man
i'd<00:05:50.000> like<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.330> have<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.570> case<00:05:50.750> but<00:05:50.960> it's

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
i'd like to have the case but it's

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.570 
i'd like to have the case but it's
probably<00:05:51.320> another<00:05:51.440> 30<00:05:51.710> dollar<00:05:52.010> case<00:05:52.280> just

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
probably another 30 dollar case just

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.060 
probably another 30 dollar case just
like<00:05:52.640> speck<00:05:53.150> cases<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.110> no<00:05:54.620> shots<00:05:54.860> that

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
like speck cases and and no shots that

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.909 
like speck cases and and no shots that
speck<00:05:55.310> or<00:05:55.430> anything<00:05:55.730> i'm<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:55.940> say<00:05:56.090> most<00:05:56.330> people

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
speck or anything i'm to say most people

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.050 
speck or anything i'm to say most people
you<00:05:57.919> know<00:05:58.040> what<00:05:58.280> they<00:05:58.370> think<00:05:58.610> when<00:05:58.760> they<00:05:58.790> see<00:05:58.880> a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
you know what they think when they see a

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.190 
you know what they think when they see a
nice<00:05:59.240> case<00:05:59.510> is<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.840> it's<00:05:59.930> going<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.110> be

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
nice case is that it's going to be

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.130

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 
iphone 4 and the 3gs but this is

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.180 
iphone 4 and the 3gs but this is
definitely<00:07:14.870> one<00:07:15.200> of<00:07:15.230> my<00:07:15.350> favorite<00:07:15.740> ones<00:07:15.920> and

the whole objective of a bumper case is

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.980 
the whole objective of a bumper case is
just<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.340> be<00:07:19.460> lightweight<00:07:19.790> and<00:07:20.300> like

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
just to be lightweight and like

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.750 
just to be lightweight and like
nothing's<00:07:21.410> there<00:07:21.620> in<00:07:21.860> this<00:07:21.980> case<00:07:22.190> does<00:07:22.490> that

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
nothing's there in this case does that

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.360 
nothing's there in this case does that
perfectly
