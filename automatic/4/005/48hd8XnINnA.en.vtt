00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 fifth generation I tell you this is a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 ipod of fifth generation and is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.490
 running to young 6 who is already coming 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 defect installed already key 6 already has 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 siri in Spanish so what are we going 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 to do is a demo to say and in Spanish 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 has Spanish from Spanish Mexico 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 Spain and Spanish from the USA and I've been 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 using these days and the truth that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 it works very well siri and good so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 let's try let's have a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 conversation when opening the interface say 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 and we just have to put pressure 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.699
 the home button for three seconds and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.560
 the application is automatically launched 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 We can ask you several things and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.739
 well here they will see more or less how it is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 that works like this and in Spanish on the ipod 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.980
 5th generation hello touch siri 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.240
 how are you 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 thanks for asking what is the weather 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 for today 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.810
 it seems that today will be good weather until 24 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.070
 degrees and partially sunny as it was 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.070
 Real Madrid match 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 They defeated the 6 of de vido with a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 result of 12 to 0 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.360
 How many goals does Cristiano Ronaldo have? 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.270
 cristian 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.740
 Another option that you have to go is that you 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 You can say send a message to me 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.490
 wife telling him that I'm going to get five 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.259
 minutes late and it will be automatically 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.539
 Message formulas to get it right 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.310
 but in the case of the ipad touch 5g that does not 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.200
 they can send messages or make calls 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 can you say for example make a face 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.039
 time with paco and it will automatically be 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.569
 the call via facetime or also you 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.859
 can you say that you post on facebook or 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:45.429
 on twitter for example here we are going to 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.429
 say tweeting by recording a new video 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.229
 klich 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.549
 As you can see, it does not tweet but here we 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.050
 says recording a new video here what 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.040
 let's cancel 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.930
 another thing that you have that you can use 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.910
 as your secretary can tell you 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.260
 make an event for such now I get 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.750
 events for today so that's what 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.550
 let's see let's create an event 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.550
 create an event for today at 5 pm 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.180
 I created an event to cancel 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.570
 well here are all the options that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.340
 you can do I got tested several 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.380
 of these here is to publish in 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.090
 twitter post on facebook ask 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.310
 about sports events ask 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.750
 about movie restaurants here 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.190
 can you tell where is a sim and you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.410
 send the address and send you the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.210
 Map application and you can see how 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.920
 get there you can go reproduce a 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.230
 song that logically you have in your 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 library you can send emails about 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.130
 of time see how the bag is 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.200
 set a contact alarm 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.340
 add notes or search for things on the internet 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.080
 which is one of the main functions 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.180
 for example here we are going to look for something in 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.180
 internet ipod touch 5g 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.520
 but I can search 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.500
 of 5 g 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.330
 if you have 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.520
 and here we simply give in search in 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.110
 internet and here already opens us on safari 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.280
 so this was the one we should say and I think 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 that works pretty well in what 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.820
 I really liked the staff. 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.590
 comments that other ipod videos 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.880
 touch 5g want to see 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.320
 Check the other videos that you uploaded to 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.610

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.410
 video is going to have a menu for them to see 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.480
