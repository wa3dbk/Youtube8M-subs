look at the mechanical advance on your

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.870 
look at the mechanical advance on your
local<00:00:07.140> distributor<00:00:07.400> now<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.580> we've<00:00:08.730> got

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
local distributor now what we've got

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.720 
local distributor now what we've got
here<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.690> Lucas<00:00:10.200> style<00:00:10.469> 25<00:00:10.950> B<00:00:11.130> distributor

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
here is a Lucas style 25 B distributor

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.280 
here is a Lucas style 25 B distributor
and<00:00:12.120> most<00:00:12.480> distributors<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and most distributors are going to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.980 
and most distributors are going to
follow<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.679> same<00:00:13.920> sort<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> design<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:15.750> first

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
follow the same sort of design so first

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
follow the same sort of design so first
thing<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.680> pop<00:00:16.859> off<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> cap

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
thing we do is pop off a cap

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
thing we do is pop off a cap
now<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.449> one's<00:00:18.630> already<00:00:18.810> fitted<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.230> an

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
now this one's already fitted with an

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.640 
now this one's already fitted with an
active<00:00:19.560> spoke<00:00:19.770> module<00:00:20.869> if<00:00:21.869> you've<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.230> points

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
active spoke module if you've got points

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.960 
active spoke module if you've got points
what<00:00:22.920> you'll<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> take<00:00:23.519> them<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.820> now

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
what you'll do to take them out now

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
what you'll do to take them out now
discard<00:00:24.510> those<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> fit<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> module<00:00:25.590> later

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
discard those and fit the module later

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.419 
discard those and fit the module later
on<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.080> thing<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.010> undo<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
on the first thing we do is we undo the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:54.580 
on the first thing we do is we undo the
screws<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:48.649> pull<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> trigger<00:00:50.070> wheel

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.799 

now<00:00:56.120> inside<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> advanced

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
now inside there you see the advanced

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.280 
now inside there you see the advanced
Springs<00:01:02.510> okay<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
Springs okay now it's going to be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.750 
Springs okay now it's going to be
necessary<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.860> those<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.309> wire<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
necessary to take those out and wire it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
necessary to take those out and wire it
out<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.510> although<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.439> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
out now although you could do it like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.060 
out now although you could do it like
that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
that
it'd<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.580> easier<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.060> pull<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> whole

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it'd be much easier to pull the whole

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
it'd be much easier to pull the whole
thing<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.710> we're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
thing out so what we're going to do is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.450 
thing out so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> turn<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> other<00:01:12.600> way

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
we're going to turn it out the other way

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
we're going to turn it out the other way
you're<00:01:14.460> gonna<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> small<00:01:15.090> drift<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.080> we're

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you're gonna get a small drift and we're

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
you're gonna get a small drift and we're
gonna<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.470> punch<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:18.150> roll<00:01:18.390> pin<00:01:18.689> with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
