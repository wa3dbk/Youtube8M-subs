00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
These last few days, 
I've been trying to avoid

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.990
thinking too much about the fact

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.990
that when you become, or dream
of becoming an orchestra conductor,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.490
this is the moment 
you're actually dreaming of:

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.490
to be standing on the podium
of the Berlin philharmonic.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
Nothing could be more special.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.490
I've tried not to think about that
these last few days, 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.490
so as not to live in anguish,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.990
and to tell myself 
it's business as usual.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.990
I've seen a lot of orchestras,
that's a fact,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.490
and some that are almost
just as mythical,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.990
like the Vienna and the Dresden
philharmonic orchestras.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.990
Of course, Berlin is better known
and more mythical.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.490
I had promised myself
that I wouldn't get caught up in fear.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.990
I could be nervous when I got here, 
but not afraid.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.990
They made me feel welcome,
with smiles all around.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.490
Everybody sat down,
and we started to play.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490
The sound reached me immediately.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.490
Not exactly the one I was looking for,
but their own particular sound.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.490
That's what's fascinating
about being a conductor:

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.490
to gradually shape their sound
without losing their personality.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.490
We read a lot in the first movement.
I didn't work so much.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.990
Then I spent an hour on the 1st movement
of the Symphonie fantastique.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.990
One of the things
that impressed me the most

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990
is their capacity...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.990
The attitude was: "Tell us
what you want and we'll do it."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.490
I was struck by their willingness
to take in my interpretation,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.490
to work and to change,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.490
to adapt their material
to my wishes, and...

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.490
I never felt that anyone was bored
or would rather be somewhere else.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.990
You do get the feeling
with some orchestras

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.490
that you're bothering them
and they'd like to go home.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.990
There was none of that here,
so I'm really thrilled.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.990
I feel like we're colleagues.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.490
- It's fantastic 
that musicians of this caliber,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.990
from such a renowned orchestra,
are still willing to adapt.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.990
- That's probably why...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.990
In fact, that's most certainly why
the orchestra is so mythical:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.490
because they are willing to change.
Not for the sake of it,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.490
but because they're eager
to get it right.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.990
You know as well as I do, FranÃ§oise,
that when music is your life,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.990
your whole life...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.990
Music is a metaphor for life,
it teaches us

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.490
that nothing is ever finished,
that you can always learn.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.490
The more my "career" advances,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.490
and I don't like to use that word 
very much,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.490
but the further I get,
the more I realize it's true:

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.490
the greatest musicians are those
who constantly question themselves

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.990
and try to go further.
That doesn't really surprise me.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.990
When you think about an orchestra,
it's not like a soloist.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.990
It's a huge beast
made up of many little beasts,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.490
and you expect them to go:
"It's not like that! Period!"

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.490
But these musicians
really went...

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.990
It's truly... admirable.
- You communicate in English?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.990
- Yes, but we also had a lot
of interactions in German.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.990
They speak English extremely well.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.990
Sir Simon Rattle and most guest conductors
rehearse in English, 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.990
but it's good to show...
I'd never done so much in German.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.490
It came to me easily, 
thankfully.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.490
I sometimes mixed it up with Dutch.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.990
I tended to make a Dutch "u",
which should be "oo" in German,
62
00:04:01,00 --&gt; 00:03:06,49
and I would also say the Dutch "twee"
instead of "zwei" for the word "two".

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.990
That comes from working in Rotterdam.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.490
- They appreciate your speaking German?
- Surely.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.490
My concertmaster is young, 
and so is the leader of the 2nd violins.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.490
They all seem to have 
enough experience,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.990
but there's a nice mix
of musicians of all levels.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.990
The alto soloist
has only been here a month,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and he loves it.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.990
Unfortunately, the flutist
Emmanuel Pahud 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.990
sent me an email yesterday 
to say that he can't be here.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.990
I know Stefan Schweigert, on the bassoon,
from the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.490
Marie-Pierre Langlamet,
the French solo harpist,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.490
is friends with many
French musicians I know.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.490
So I'm surrounded by
almost familiar faces.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.490
- So you're feeling quite good tonight,
and you didn't experience any fear.
77
00:05:00,50--&gt; 00:05:06,50
How do you fight off such feelings
just before "jumping into the ring"?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.990
- "Just before" 
is not the worst moment.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.490
The hour before the show,
I'm here in the dressing-room,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.990
the music is my only concern,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.990
and my experience kicks in.
Besides, I wanted to do this.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.990
I did have moments of fear,
of slight panic

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.490
in the last few days, because I had 
the time to think about it.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.490
It was a bit tricky
to fight it off.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.990
I was helped by the messages I got,
the fact that I'm not alone,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.990
and the support I received,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.490
from your collaborators 
on this website, among others.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.990
Knowing that people are writing
and will be listening,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.990
feeling my country's pride,
that does help a lot.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.490
I'm also very well surrounded here.
91
00:06:02,50--&gt; 00:06:06,49
I'm lucky to have my family 
and friends with me.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.990
I don't think that... you can conquer 
these steps alone in life.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.990
It wouldn't be interesting, anyway.
It's better to share.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.490
- We'll see each other tomorrow
after the full rehearsal?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.990
You'll be doing
the whole program, right?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.490
- Actually, tomorrow
we'll first launch into Messiaen,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.490
then work some more on Berlioz.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.490
In the afternoon, either Messiaen
or Berlioz, then Prokofiev.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.490
We'll be covering almost everything,
but we'll concentrate

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.490
on Prokofiev in the afternoon.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.490
I'll have my first meeting with Mr. Bronfman,
then a chat with you.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.990
- See you tomorrow, Yannick.
- See you tomorrow.
