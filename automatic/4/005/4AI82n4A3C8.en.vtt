00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 two 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.950
 i 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 waves or I fall to ferrero and today we are going to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 do another partial punching we use 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.190
 facts and dies of latina craft 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.770
 of this called love songs 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.110
 let's use the phrase and this other that 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.809
 it's called 10 sun we're going to use the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.540
 vaquita de san antonio and the flower of my 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.820
 facebook without this grass die 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.430
 called thank you let's use the more 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 tiny on a piece of paper the same 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.500
 width of the card we will locate the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.269
 tropel of grass that measures 5 inches and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.610
 half as wide as all cards 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.040
 of standard we do a bit of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.470
 planning using the dies of the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.470
 two other images and the phrase that goes to 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.240
 be in the middle we do with pencil 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.240
 the models where it starts and ends 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.190
 each die and adhere to the paper using 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.200
 Post-it tape that has low adhesion 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.810
 and it does not harm it when we remove it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.579
 we go to the habitat and as he explains in 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.799
 the previous video to do the 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.590
 Partial die-cutting what we do not want 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.229
 Die-cutting should be left out of the sandwich 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.020
 of trays we started stumbling the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.079
 tip of the grass from the mark to the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.720
 edge of the card for that making a 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.549
 little bit of balance we use the edge of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.940
 the trays because everything else should 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.580
 stay out of the sandwich 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.040
 we went through the machine and scepter that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.870
 only the tip now we must 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.330
 leave the space of the flower without another 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.350
 peeling and punching the middle between the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.990
 Flower and the mouth of San Antonio 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.570
 for that we passed the trays to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.240
 that are only superimposed on this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.149
 section of the paper between the marks of the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.920
 flower and the vaquita we went through the vine 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.170
 shock and I have to lick only the middle 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.050
 now we do the same thing again as 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.090
 beginning with the other end from the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.850
 Vaquita to the side of the card 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 right leaving everything else out of 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.709
 the trays and so die the masters all the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.340
 grass or grass die for 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.200
 sectors 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.260
 now those sectors that we leave without 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.940
 die with the figure of the grass there is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 that stamp them with the figure of the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.209
 flower and with the figure of the vaquita but 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.709
 just from the grass line up 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.680
 so we put the dies in the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.040
 spaces that we leave we adhere to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.400
 little with tape post and we leave them the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.330
 lower part of the sandwich outside 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.570
 tray 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.370
 we go through the vision and if there is any 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.260
 detail without die cutting we help with 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.350
 the krafft night the team hall for 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.390
 cut it out 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.460
 now we print the flower and the vaquita 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.530
 with an increase taxi all black because 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.840
 I'm going to do a basic coloring with copy 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.900
 marks and this ink does not mix with the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 diluent of those color markers and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.890
 masters quickly 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.500
 now it 's colored we put the kraft of 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.920
 reinier below 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.840
 the fit face is a work surface 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.600
 vitrified where nothing dries and everything 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.730
 clean ideal for working with inks and 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.730
 with other wet materials 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.690
 with the child applied round of richter 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.140
 and always applying in the same way 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.840
 of how the grass grows we apply 235 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.420
 evergreen bous to mark a 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.410
 little the edges and it is suggested that this is 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.410
 grass and it's green 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.370
 then we grabbed the card base that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.910
 We are going to use and we adhere to the craft with 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.130
 masking or paper tape and paste 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.950
 just in the fold of the ribbon card 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.569
 post-it to use it also masking 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.839
 that edge 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.460
 we use distress inc campbell kraft and with 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:00.740
 the mini round applicator also 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.050
 we apply ink always from above to 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.349
 down doing the first application 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.569
 after embedding the applicator in the pad 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.999
 in the kraft or in the post it tape as well 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.520
 ink unload some cargo 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.889
 we just grabbed and there is no mark 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.159
 of the applicator on the card or a 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.830
 strip with much more ink than the others 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.080
 in this way we achieve a good degrade 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.149
 As it became very white I add more 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.740
 green ink to the bit of grass 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.639
 this time applying it from above 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.129
 as well 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.009
 we present the two pieces and the lower one 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.349
 the drift we adhere from behind tape 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.090
 double-sided rubber of 13 m so that 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.810
 mount it to the panel have a bit of 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.810
 dimension 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.100
 the tape I cut in half so that 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.080
 excel with titanium scissors 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.410
 Tim Holt ideal for trimming 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.720
 Sticky surfaces before adhering 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.000
 the image to the card placed it where 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.819
 will go to measure the stamp of the phrase 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.650
 I ask with a taxi moment to bend and 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.650
 stamped right in the space between 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.810
 Vaquita and the flower 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.780
 now I do adhere the image on the card 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.060
 and this is the card I had 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.039
 ready for you today using 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.590
