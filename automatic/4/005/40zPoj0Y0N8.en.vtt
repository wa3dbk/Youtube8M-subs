so<00:00:07.080> I'm<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.380> attach<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.010> back<00:00:08.370> piece

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
so I'm going to attach this back piece

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.129 
so I'm going to attach this back piece
to<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.530> gusset<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.799> this<00:00:11.490> bag<00:00:11.840> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
to the gusset of this bag this is a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.820 
to the gusset of this bag this is a
straight<00:00:13.559> line<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.480> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.440> curved

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
straight line and this is a curved

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920 
straight line and this is a curved
corner<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> try<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.630> attach

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
corner so we're going to try and attach

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140 
corner so we're going to try and attach
those<00:00:19.289> right<00:00:19.800> sides<00:00:19.830> together<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> bag

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
those right sides together on the bag

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.929 
those right sides together on the bag
I've<00:00:22.020> started<00:00:22.380> pinning<00:00:23.009> the<00:00:23.160> other<00:00:23.369> side<00:00:23.759> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
I've started pinning the other side of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
I've started pinning the other side of
the<00:00:24.060> gusset<00:00:24.509> I<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> make<00:00:25.470> sure<00:00:25.499> that<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the gusset I want to make sure that the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
the gusset I want to make sure that the
two<00:00:26.429> centers<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.570> either<00:00:27.929> side<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
two centers on this either side of the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.970 
two centers on this either side of the
gusset<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.279> lined<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> corners

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
gusset are lined up and that the corners

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
gusset are lined up and that the corners
are<00:00:32.220> lined<00:00:32.490> up<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.970> either<00:00:33.120> side<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
are lined up on either side of the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010 
are lined up on either side of the
gusset<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.470> when<00:00:35.310> I<00:00:35.340> pin<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.150> pin<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
gusset and when I pin I pin from the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.610 
gusset and when I pin I pin from the
center<00:00:37.560> toward<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> corner<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.440> from<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
center toward the corner and from the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.790 
center toward the corner and from the
center<00:00:41.190> toward<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.210> corner<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:43.380> curve

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
center toward the corner and then curve

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.600 
center toward the corner and then curve
it<00:00:43.980> around<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.460> gusset<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.460> going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it around the gusset okay so I'm going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.120 
it around the gusset okay so I'm going
to<00:00:47.670> stitch<00:00:47.940> around<00:00:48.150> a<00:00:48.750> curve<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
to stitch around a curve this is a

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.730 
to stitch around a curve this is a
straight<00:00:50.610> edge<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.240> have<00:00:51.570> clipped<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.260> edges

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
straight edge I have clipped the edges

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.770 
straight edge I have clipped the edges
so<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.040> it<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.490> spread<00:00:53.820> open<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.600> comes

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so that it will spread open as it comes

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.210 
so that it will spread open as it comes
around<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.200> curve<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.850> pin<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.630> based

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
around the curve you go pin or based

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.130 
around the curve you go pin or based
around<00:00:59.220> this<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.450> close<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
around this and as I get close to the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.910 
around this and as I get close to the
curve<00:01:02.960> I'm<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> leave<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> needle<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
curve I'm going to leave the needle in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.340 
curve I'm going to leave the needle in
and<00:01:05.519> keep<00:01:06.330> repositioning<00:01:07.400> pull<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.610> fabric

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
and keep repositioning pull this fabric

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.349 
and keep repositioning pull this fabric
from<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> left<00:01:10.799> side<00:01:11.130> keep<00:01:11.700> trying<00:01:11.999> to<00:01:12.090> line

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
from the left side keep trying to line

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.499 
from the left side keep trying to line
up<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.140> curve<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.549> might<00:01:15.270> even

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
up with the curve over here I might even

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.709 
up with the curve over here I might even
do<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.929> as<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.079> hand<00:01:16.439> crank<00:01:17.749> up<00:01:18.749> lift<00:01:19.320> up

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
do it as a hand crank up lift up

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.440 
do it as a hand crank up lift up
pull<00:01:21.719> it<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:22.460> pull<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.579> fabric<00:01:23.850> around

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pull it around pull the fabric around

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.249 
pull it around pull the fabric around
again<00:01:27.170> take<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> couple<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.799> stitches<00:01:30.259> leave

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
again take a couple more stitches leave

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.120 
again take a couple more stitches leave
the<00:01:31.409> knees<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> pull<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:33.649> keep<00:01:34.649> pulling<00:01:35.039> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the knees and pull up keep pulling it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
the knees and pull up keep pulling it
around<00:01:35.420> lining<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.539> up<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> couple<00:01:40.079> more

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
around lining it up like a couple more

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.749 
around lining it up like a couple more
stitches<00:01:40.740> leave<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:46.880> more<00:01:47.880> straight

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
stitches leave it in and more straight

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.319 
stitches leave it in and more straight
and<00:01:50.759> we're<00:01:51.209> gonna<00:01:51.359> see<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:53.329> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and we're gonna see how that looks so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
and we're gonna see how that looks so
see<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.079> clicked<00:01:55.380> edge<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
see this is the clicked edge and that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.879 
see this is the clicked edge and that
came<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.539> other<00:01:57.689> thing<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.109> is<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
came or the other thing I do is that I

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.239 
came or the other thing I do is that I
allow<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> gusset<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.649> about<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.709> half<00:02:02.039> an

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
allow the gusset to be about a half an

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.389 
allow the gusset to be about a half an
inch<00:02:02.369> longer<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.539> lower<00:02:03.749> gusset<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> when

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
inch longer on the lower gusset and when

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
inch longer on the lower gusset and when
I'm<00:02:05.520> sewing<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.779> front<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.170> the

each side like that that way if I
miscalculated<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.370> extra<00:02:27.610> half<00:02:28.090> an

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
miscalculated I have that extra half an

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.250 
miscalculated I have that extra half an
inch<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:29.470> do<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> final<00:02:30.250> seam<00:02:30.580> up

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
inch and I can then do the final seam up
