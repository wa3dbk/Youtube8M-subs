00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
things that I would like in a favour for

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.060 
things that I would like in a favour for
us<00:01:00.879> for<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.210> time<00:01:01.420> line<00:01:01.720> between<00:01:02.170> fable<00:01:02.769> 1<00:01:02.920> and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
us for the time line between fable 1 and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.000 
us for the time line between fable 1 and
2<00:01:03.190> we<00:01:03.489> saw<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.030> massive<00:01:04.479> 500<00:01:04.750> year<00:01:05.229> gap<00:01:05.500> that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
2 we saw the massive 500 year gap that

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.340 
2 we saw the massive 500 year gap that
was<00:01:06.220> much<00:01:06.700> less<00:01:06.940> in<00:01:07.150> fable<00:01:07.510> 3<00:01:07.719> I<00:01:07.840> would<00:01:08.079> like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
was much less in fable 3 I would like

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.760 
was much less in fable 3 I would like
the<00:01:08.890> same<00:01:09.100> kind<00:01:09.399> of<00:01:09.490> jump<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.060> 20<00:01:11.020> or<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.409> years

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the same kind of jump of 20 or so years

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.399 
the same kind of jump of 20 or so years
maybe<00:01:12.250> up<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.490> 50<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.210> thinking<00:01:13.630> of<00:01:13.719> a<00:01:13.810> 500<00:01:14.380> year

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
maybe up to 50 I thinking of a 500 year

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.139 
maybe up to 50 I thinking of a 500 year
jump<00:01:14.829> would<00:01:14.979> be<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> bit<00:01:15.340> excessive<00:01:15.729> and

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
jump would be a bit excessive and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.330 
jump would be a bit excessive and
technology<00:01:17.020> would<00:01:17.170> be<00:01:17.289> far<00:01:17.500> too<00:01:17.530> advanced<00:01:18.219> and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
technology would be far too advanced and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.740 
technology would be far too advanced and
it<00:01:18.430> wouldn't<00:01:18.700> really<00:01:18.850> feel<00:01:19.119> like<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.329> favorable

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
it wouldn't really feel like a favorable

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.929 
it wouldn't really feel like a favorable
game<00:01:19.929> in<00:01:20.079> my<00:01:20.229> opinion<00:01:20.679> it<00:01:20.950> was<00:01:21.070> become<00:01:21.640> far<00:01:21.909> too

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
game in my opinion it was become far too

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.209 
game in my opinion it was become far too
sci-fi<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:23.170> course<00:01:23.469> we<00:01:23.619> had<00:01:23.710> elements<00:01:23.920> of

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
sci-fi of course we had elements of

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.749 
sci-fi of course we had elements of
steampunk<00:01:24.600> settings<00:01:25.600> within<00:01:26.259> fable<00:01:26.979> 3<00:01:27.310> which

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
steampunk settings within fable 3 which

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.370 
steampunk settings within fable 3 which
is<00:01:27.789> fine<00:01:28.149> it<00:01:28.390> worked<00:01:28.570> really<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:28.960> with<00:01:29.109> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
is fine it worked really well with the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.230 
is fine it worked really well with the
art<00:01:29.530> style<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:30.130> think<00:01:30.609> that<00:01:31.000> would<00:01:31.090> go

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
art style I just think that would go

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.270 
art style I just think that would go
much<00:01:31.450> further<00:01:31.689> than<00:01:32.049> what<00:01:32.200> we've<00:01:32.350> gone<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:33.039> for

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
much further than what we've gone as for

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520 
much further than what we've gone as for
location<00:01:33.539> Albion<00:01:34.539> is<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.689> great<00:01:34.869> setting<00:01:35.259> and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
location Albion is a great setting and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.580 
location Albion is a great setting and
had<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.189> great<00:01:36.490> variety<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:37.390> towns<00:01:38.200> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
had a great variety of towns and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.099 
had a great variety of towns and
locations<00:01:39.579> in<00:01:39.729> general<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.509> would<00:01:40.810> like

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
locations in general what I would like

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.969 
locations in general what I would like
is<00:01:41.499> the<00:01:42.479> discovery<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.719> other<00:01:43.869> continents<00:01:44.619> so

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
is the discovery of other continents so

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.620 
is the discovery of other continents so
this<00:01:45.249> could<00:01:45.429> be<00:01:45.520> part<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.939> main<00:01:46.090> storyline

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
this could be part of the main storyline

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.190 
this could be part of the main storyline
where<00:01:46.899> say<00:01:47.469> we're<00:01:48.100> king<00:01:48.490> or<00:01:48.729> queen<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.299> we

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
where say we're king or queen and we

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.279 
where say we're king or queen and we
feel<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.649> need<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:51.310> expand<00:01:51.999> our<00:01:52.119> Empire<00:01:52.569> so<00:01:53.049> we

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
feel the need to expand our Empire so we

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.559 
feel the need to expand our Empire so we
go<00:01:53.409> out<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.740> voyage<00:01:53.950> maybe<00:01:54.429> on<00:01:54.609> a<00:01:54.640> ship<00:01:54.939> or<00:01:55.149> an

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
go out on a voyage maybe on a ship or an

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.959 
go out on a voyage maybe on a ship or an
airship<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.259> Zeppelin<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.920> basically<00:01:57.670> we

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
airship like a Zeppelin and basically we

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.910 
airship like a Zeppelin and basically we
feel<00:01:58.179> like<00:01:58.420> taking<00:01:58.810> them<00:01:58.929> over<00:01:59.020> because<00:01:59.530> we

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
feel like taking them over because we

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.669 
feel like taking them over because we
are<00:02:00.039> just<00:02:00.340> cold-hearted<00:02:01.149> individuals<00:02:01.719> or<00:02:01.990> we

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
are just cold-hearted individuals or we

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.099 
are just cold-hearted individuals or we
could<00:02:02.920> maybe<00:02:03.280> meet<00:02:03.639> them<00:02:03.850> for<00:02:04.299> trading<00:02:04.600> and

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
could maybe meet them for trading and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.739 
could maybe meet them for trading and
expansion<00:02:06.069> of<00:02:06.159> technology<00:02:06.759> basically<00:02:07.270> just

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
expansion of technology basically just

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.600 
expansion of technology basically just
give<00:02:07.869> us<00:02:07.960> an<00:02:08.020> excuse<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.679> expand<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.490> world

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
give us an excuse to expand the world

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.820 
give us an excuse to expand the world
beyond<00:02:09.970> Albion<00:02:10.450> because<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.200> new<00:02:11.350> world<00:02:11.590> was

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
beyond Albion because the new world was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.680 
beyond Albion because the new world was
hinted<00:02:12.250> at<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.459> previous<00:02:12.640> games<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.390> believe

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
hinted at in previous games I believe

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.500 
hinted at in previous games I believe
you<00:02:13.840> sent<00:02:14.110> certain<00:02:14.709> people<00:02:15.069> out<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.370> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you sent certain people out on a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
you sent certain people out on a
expedition<00:02:16.510> but

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
expedition but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.940 
expedition but
they<00:02:17.090> unfortunately<00:02:17.720> died<00:02:18.110> when<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.650> did<00:02:18.830> it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
they unfortunately died when we did it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
they unfortunately died when we did it
so<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.970> progression<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.690> locations

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
so I think the progression of locations

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.430 
so I think the progression of locations
is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> must<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.390> fable<00:02:23.750> 4<00:02:23.960> they<00:02:24.080> do<00:02:24.140> go

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
is a must and if in fable 4 they do go

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.620 
is a must and if in fable 4 they do go
down<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.800> hole<00:02:24.980> stay<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.910> honors<00:02:26.180> king<00:02:26.420> or

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
down the hole stay in honors king or

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.170 
down the hole stay in honors king or
queen<00:02:26.780> then<00:02:27.320> make<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.130> choices<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.150> have

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
queen then make the choices that we have

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.080 
queen then make the choices that we have
not<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:30.230> limited<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> sense<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.490> we

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
not so limited in the sense that we

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.300 
not so limited in the sense that we
basically<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.660> got<00:02:33.170> given<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.890> option<00:02:34.280> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
basically just got given the option to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.180 
basically just got given the option to
either<00:02:34.580> appease<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.720> townspeople<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:36.740> make

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
either appease the townspeople or make

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.060 
either appease the townspeople or make
it<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:38.120> gained<00:02:38.360> money<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.770> just

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
it so that we gained money and it just

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.280 
it so that we gained money and it just
felt<00:02:40.310> very<00:02:40.820> limited<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.900> we

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
felt very limited for what we

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.380 
felt very limited for what we
essentially<00:02:42.709> we're<00:02:43.070> I<00:02:43.100> mean<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.580> king<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.209> queen

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
essentially we're I mean a king or queen

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.000 
essentially we're I mean a king or queen
should<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.810> absolute<00:02:45.230> reins<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.830> have

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
should have absolute reins that have

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.740 
should have absolute reins that have
just<00:02:46.160> being<00:02:46.370> given<00:02:46.730> one<00:02:46.760> or<00:02:47.060> two<00:02:47.209> options<00:02:47.390> by

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
just being given one or two options by

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.990 
just being given one or two options by
our<00:02:47.900> advisers<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.040> whole<00:02:49.220> second<00:02:49.670> half<00:02:49.850> of

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
our advisers the whole second half of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240 
our advisers the whole second half of
fable<00:02:50.360> 3<00:02:50.540> was<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> bit<00:02:51.080> underwhelming

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
fable 3 was a bit underwhelming

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.949 
fable 3 was a bit underwhelming
that's<00:02:52.489> probably<00:02:52.850> putting<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.420> quite<00:02:53.660> lightly

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that's probably putting it quite lightly

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.500 
that's probably putting it quite lightly
but<00:02:54.530> give<00:02:54.709> us<00:02:54.739> far<00:02:55.040> more<00:02:55.070> choices<00:02:55.790> make<00:02:56.270> them

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
but give us far more choices make them

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.150 
but give us far more choices make them
actually<00:02:56.810> mean<00:02:56.989> something<00:02:57.020> instead<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.800> just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
actually mean something instead of just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.910 
actually mean something instead of just
accumulating<00:02:59.090> money<00:02:59.360> or<00:02:59.660> popularity<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
accumulating money or popularity and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.010 
accumulating money or popularity and
have<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> lot<00:03:01.520> of<00:03:01.640> moral<00:03:01.910> gray<00:03:02.300> areas<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.870> makes

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
have a lot of moral gray areas to makes

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.510 
have a lot of moral gray areas to makes
much<00:03:03.200> more<00:03:03.230> tough<00:03:03.620> decisions<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.370> not

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
much more tough decisions and not

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.610 
much more tough decisions and not
decisions<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.630> know<00:03:06.110> are<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.560> to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
decisions that you know are going to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.590 
decisions that you know are going to
affect<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.100> achievements<00:03:07.730> beforehand

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
affect your achievements beforehand

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.680 
affect your achievements beforehand
which<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.320> kind<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.620> what<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.040> had<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:11.000> fable<00:03:11.480> 3

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
which is kind of what I had in fable 3

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.890 
which is kind of what I had in fable 3
that's<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.860> feeling<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.970> anyway<00:03:14.330> one

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that's the feeling that I go anyway one

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.690 
that's the feeling that I go anyway one
big<00:03:15.110> thing<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.470> would<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:16.130> more

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
big thing I would like is more

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.479 
big thing I would like is more
unexplored<00:03:17.510> dungeons<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.440> caves<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.370> stuff

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
unexplored dungeons and caves and stuff

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.100 
unexplored dungeons and caves and stuff
like<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.970> similar<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.690> what<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.930> see<00:03:21.080> in

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
like that similar to what you see in

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.190 
like that similar to what you see in
Skyrim<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.769> Oblivion<00:03:22.070> fable<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.360> far<00:03:23.810> too<00:03:23.840> many

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
Skyrim in Oblivion fable in far too many

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.740 
Skyrim in Oblivion fable in far too many
instances<00:03:24.440> felt<00:03:25.070> very<00:03:25.519> linear<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.180> I'll<00:03:26.540> just

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
instances felt very linear and I'll just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.930 
instances felt very linear and I'll just
say<00:03:26.930> outside<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.830> side<00:03:28.040> quests<00:03:28.430> give<00:03:28.790> us

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
say outside of the side quests give us

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.390 
say outside of the side quests give us
some<00:03:29.150> stuff<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.900> explore<00:03:30.320> give<00:03:30.799> us<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.070> network

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
some stuff to explore give us a network

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.060 
some stuff to explore give us a network
of<00:03:31.549> caves<00:03:31.820> dungeons<00:03:32.780> with<00:03:32.959> rare<00:03:33.200> enemies<00:03:33.650> with

of<00:03:36.200> exploration<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:37.160> fable<00:03:37.549> seems<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.880> lack

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
of exploration that fable seems to lack

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.780 
of exploration that fable seems to lack
compared<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> lot<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.870> other<00:03:39.080> RPGs<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.010> one

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
compared to a lot of other RPGs and one

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.789 
compared to a lot of other RPGs and one
big<00:03:41.090> observation<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.260> would<00:03:42.410> like<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
big observation that I would like in the

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.120 
big observation that I would like in the
game<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.450> 2d<00:03:44.450> simplify<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.019> game<00:03:45.320> obviously

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
game is 2d simplify the game obviously

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.920 
game is 2d simplify the game obviously
don't<00:03:46.489> make<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.880> too<00:03:47.239> complex

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
don't make it too complex

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.259 
don't make it too complex
I'm<00:03:48.110> not<00:03:48.320> saying<00:03:48.590> make<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.549> a<00:03:49.579> Diablo

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
I'm not saying make it like a Diablo

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.229 
I'm not saying make it like a Diablo
game<00:03:50.510> or<00:03:50.690> something<00:03:51.049> but<00:03:51.320> fable<00:03:51.860> 3<00:03:52.190> was<00:03:52.579> far

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
game or something but fable 3 was far

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.180 
game or something but fable 3 was far
too<00:03:53.269> dumbed<00:03:53.750> down<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.170> my<00:03:54.290> opinion<00:03:54.769> especially

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
too dumbed down in my opinion especially

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.550 
too dumbed down in my opinion especially
with<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.880> combat<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.930> experience

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
with the combat and the experience

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.280 
with the combat and the experience
system<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.400> one<00:03:58.579> button<00:03:58.880> system<00:03:59.180> works<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.170> an

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
system the one button system works to an

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.110 
system the one button system works to an
extent<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.190> think<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.459> could<00:04:01.610> be<00:04:01.730> expanded

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
extent I just think it could be expanded

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.360 
extent I just think it could be expanded
on<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.450> bit<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.840> mean<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.230> seems<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.010> combat

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
on a bit I mean it seems like the combat

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.090 
on a bit I mean it seems like the combat
system<00:04:04.579> was<00:04:05.030> aged<00:04:05.299> children<00:04:06.019> really<00:04:06.560> when

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
system was aged children really when

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.620 
system was aged children really when
you've<00:04:07.489> got<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.700> think<00:04:07.820> not<00:04:08.209> many<00:04:08.329> children

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
you've got I think not many children

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.690 
you've got I think not many children
will<00:04:08.959> play<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.290> game<00:04:09.500> given<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.130> age<00:04:10.220> rating

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
will play this game given the age rating

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.310 
will play this game given the age rating
and<00:04:10.880> also<00:04:11.480> give<00:04:11.660> us<00:04:11.780> some<00:04:11.810> increased

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
and also give us some increased

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.520 
and also give us some increased
difficulty<00:04:12.769> options<00:04:13.310> because<00:04:13.730> fable<00:04:14.690> two<00:04:15.290> and

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
difficulty options because fable two and

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.949 
difficulty options because fable two and
three<00:04:15.829> were<00:04:16.040> actually<00:04:16.400> incredibly<00:04:17.390> easy<00:04:17.660> and

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
three were actually incredibly easy and

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.380 
three were actually incredibly easy and
at<00:04:18.320> no<00:04:18.470> point<00:04:18.739> did<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.190> ever<00:04:19.280> feel<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.209> was

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
at no point did I ever feel like I was

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.240 
at no point did I ever feel like I was
going<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.720> die<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.440> even<00:04:21.709> close

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
going to die not even close

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.610 
going to die not even close
so<00:04:22.460> give<00:04:23.000> us<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.180> hard<00:04:23.450> option<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.080> top<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.470> the

regular one as for enemies I'd say

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.040 
regular one as for enemies I'd say

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
I know fable doesn't like to follow the

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.040 
I know fable doesn't like to follow the
crowd<00:04:46.280> with<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> lot<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.880> things<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:47.990> is

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
crowd with a lot of things but this is

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.110 
crowd with a lot of things but this is
one<00:04:48.199> where<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.680> definitely<00:04:49.100> should<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.580> would

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
one where it definitely should I would

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.120 
one where it definitely should I would
also<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.510> them<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.930> add<00:04:51.350> some<00:04:51.919> kind<00:04:52.100> of

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
also like them to add some kind of

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.879 
also like them to add some kind of
challenges<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.300> improve<00:04:53.449> your<00:04:54.440> armor<00:04:54.770> and

stuff like that and weapons for instance

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.830 
stuff like that and weapons for instance
so<00:04:57.740> in-game<00:04:58.070> challenges<00:04:58.639> like<00:04:58.880> deflect<00:04:59.570> a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
so in-game challenges like deflect a

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.600 
so in-game challenges like deflect a
sword<00:05:00.320> hit<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.620> hundred<00:05:01.100> times<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.490> instance

sword hit a hundred times for instance

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.719 
sword hit a hundred times for instance

defense that's just an example a very

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.980 
defense that's just an example a very
poor<00:05:06.889> one<00:05:07.070> admittedly<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.300> get<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.570> idea

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
poor one admittedly but you get the idea

some form instead of going to the

the actual menu with it was a bit more
on<00:05:30.260> ik<00:05:30.410> I<00:05:30.620> think<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:31.580> I'd<00:05:31.699> like<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:32.000> see<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.659 
on ik I think so I'd like to see the

didn't<00:05:48.919> have<00:05:49.070> as<00:05:49.190> many<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:49.789> I'd<00:05:49.880> say<00:05:50.060> fable<00:05:50.419> for

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
didn't have as many so I'd say fable for

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.719 
didn't have as many so I'd say fable for
just<00:05:50.870> make<00:05:50.990> a<00:05:51.020> crapload<00:05:51.349> including<00:05:52.310> weird

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
where you're meant to go because it even

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.379 
where you're meant to go because it even
doesn't<00:06:09.199> show<00:06:09.380> up<00:06:09.590> or<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.370> just<00:06:10.699> make<00:06:10.970> you<00:06:11.000> walk

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
doesn't show up or it just make you walk

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.540 
doesn't show up or it just make you walk
into<00:06:11.570> a<00:06:11.690> wall<00:06:11.990> or<00:06:12.320> it<00:06:12.650> tells<00:06:12.800> you<00:06:13.010> to<00:06:13.430> go

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
into a wall or it tells you to go

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.860 
into a wall or it tells you to go
somewhere<00:06:13.970> where<00:06:14.180> you're<00:06:14.330> not<00:06:14.419> meant<00:06:14.479> to<00:06:14.690> go

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
somewhere where you're not meant to go

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.110 
somewhere where you're not meant to go
so<00:06:15.260> navigation<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.280> pretty<00:06:16.550> big<00:06:16.760> one<00:06:16.910> for<00:06:17.060> me

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
so navigation is a pretty big one for me

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.620 
so navigation is a pretty big one for me
actually

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
actually

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.629 
actually
I've<00:06:17.960> liked<00:06:18.289> the<00:06:18.470> ability<00:06:18.889> to<00:06:19.010> buy<00:06:19.160> different

I've liked the ability to buy different
pets<00:06:20.030> other<00:06:20.510> than<00:06:20.690> dogs<00:06:20.990> letters<00:06:21.710> have<00:06:21.889> stuff

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
their own set of benefits so say your

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.050 
their own set of benefits so say your
dog<00:06:30.410> can<00:06:30.620> go<00:06:30.740> digging<00:06:31.160> for<00:06:31.190> treasure<00:06:31.520> maybe

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
dog can go digging for treasure maybe

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.170

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
and stuff like that I don't know that's

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.580 
and stuff like that I don't know that's
a<00:06:36.889> very<00:06:37.310> limited<00:06:37.699> concept<00:06:38.539> of<00:06:38.719> it<00:06:38.930> but<00:06:39.140> you<00:06:39.409> can

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
a very limited concept of it but you can

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.170 
a very limited concept of it but you can
see<00:06:39.770> where<00:06:39.950> I'm<00:06:40.039> going<00:06:40.280> with<00:06:40.370> this<00:06:40.460> I'd<00:06:41.030> also

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
see where I'm going with this I'd also

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.300 
see where I'm going with this I'd also
say<00:06:41.479> pick<00:06:42.229> a<00:06:42.260> variety<00:06:42.710> of<00:06:42.740> spells<00:06:43.159> that

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
say pick a variety of spells that

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.950 
say pick a variety of spells that
probably<00:06:43.700> go

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
probably go

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.230 
probably go
out<00:06:44.199> saying<00:06:44.440> make<00:06:45.100> jobs<00:06:45.460> more<00:06:45.699> worthwhile

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
out saying make jobs more worthwhile

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.840 
out saying make jobs more worthwhile
because<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:47.410> pay<00:06:47.620> is<00:06:47.800> pretty<00:06:47.830> rubbish<00:06:48.580> and

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
because the pay is pretty rubbish and

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.689 
because the pay is pretty rubbish and
outside<00:06:49.750> of<00:06:50.199> gathering<00:06:50.620> a<00:06:50.860> bit<00:06:51.190> of<00:06:51.280> gold<00:06:51.520> at

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
outside of gathering a bit of gold at

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:52.890 
outside of gathering a bit of gold at
the<00:06:51.729> start<00:06:52.000> of<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.180> game<00:06:52.330> they<00:06:52.569> are<00:06:52.690> pretty

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
the start of the game they are pretty

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.809 
the start of the game they are pretty
much<00:06:53.050> useless<00:06:53.319> so<00:06:53.949> an<00:06:54.069> alternative<00:06:54.550> to<00:06:54.699> this

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
much useless so an alternative to this

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.270 
much useless so an alternative to this
could<00:06:55.090> be<00:06:55.240> to<00:06:55.750> actually<00:06:56.110> make<00:06:56.620> your<00:06:56.919> jobs

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
could be to actually make your jobs

it's gonna cure AIDS and it's gonna do

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.120 
it's gonna cure AIDS and it's gonna do
our<00:07:22.060> taxes<00:07:22.570> and<00:07:22.840> the<00:07:23.380> game<00:07:23.590> you<00:07:23.680> just<00:07:23.740> never

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
our taxes and the game you just never

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.850 
our taxes and the game you just never
lives<00:07:24.460> up<00:07:24.669> to<00:07:24.880> the<00:07:25.300> billing<00:07:25.509> but<00:07:26.199> like<00:07:26.410> I<00:07:26.590> say

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
lives up to the billing but like I say

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.800 
lives up to the billing but like I say
it's<00:07:27.250> mainly<00:07:27.639> Peter<00:07:28.030> Molyneux<00:07:28.509> that<00:07:28.660> does

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
it's mainly Peter Molyneux that does

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.050 
it's mainly Peter Molyneux that does
this<00:07:28.990> so<00:07:29.289> I<00:07:29.770> imagine<00:07:30.220> this<00:07:30.610> won't<00:07:30.849> happen

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
this so I imagine this won't happen

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.469 
this so I imagine this won't happen
again

but fable is pretty synonymous with

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.420 
but fable is pretty synonymous with

with that but our main character looks

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.430 
with that but our main character looks
like<00:07:44.889> Bambi<00:07:45.280> on<00:07:45.370> ice<00:07:45.520> running<00:07:46.120> around<00:07:46.330> so<00:07:46.990> fix
