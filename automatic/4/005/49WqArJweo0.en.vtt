00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.640 
well I think it would be very rare to
see<00:01:24.180> someone<00:01:24.509> who<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.720> controlled<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see someone who is controlled and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
emotionally balanced in life and then go

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
emotionally balanced in life and then go
absolutely<00:01:27.930> nuts<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.530> their<00:01:28.650> opponent<00:01:29.040> does

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
absolutely nuts when their opponent does

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.710 
absolutely nuts when their opponent does
something<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.610> stupid<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.689> a
