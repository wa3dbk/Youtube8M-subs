00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
here from tower reviews and today we're

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.370 
here from tower reviews and today we're
going<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.790> be<00:00:02.850> doing<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.330> comparison<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.140> speed

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
going to be doing a comparison and speed

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.260 
going to be doing a comparison and speed
test<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.859> three<00:00:05.130> devices<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.730> got<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> iPod

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
test of three devices we got the iPod

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
test of three devices we got the iPod
Touch<00:00:06.569> 5th<00:00:06.810> generation<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> left<00:00:07.680> iPad

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
Touch 5th generation on the left iPad

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.570 
Touch 5th generation on the left iPad
Mini<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> center<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.620> iPhone<00:00:10.620> 5<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
Mini in the center and iPhone 5 on the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400 
Mini in the center and iPhone 5 on the
right<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.389> these<00:00:12.630> two<00:00:12.840> pretty<00:00:13.139> much<00:00:13.290> are

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
right so these two pretty much are

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.020 
right so these two pretty much are
identical<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.950> terms<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.309> specs<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.730> both<00:00:14.880> have

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
identical in terms of specs we both have

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.300 
identical in terms of specs we both have
the<00:00:15.120> a5<00:00:15.509> 512<00:00:16.139> megabytes<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.590> RAM<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.890> 32

gigabyte<00:00:17.699> internal<00:00:18.240> storage<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.170> we've

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
gigabyte internal storage and then we've

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
gigabyte internal storage and then we've
got<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> 16<00:00:19.949> gigabyte<00:00:20.130> while<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> iphone<00:00:21.119> 5

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
got the 16 gigabyte while you iphone 5

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
got the 16 gigabyte while you iphone 5
on<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> 6<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.070> 1<00:00:23.250> gigabyte<00:00:23.609> of

retina<00:00:37.410> 4-inch<00:00:38.190> displays<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> e2<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
retina 4-inch displays on the e2 on the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
retina 4-inch displays on the e2 on the
right<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:41.730> which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:43.850> 324<00:00:44.850> pixels<00:00:45.480> per

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
right and left which is 324 pixels per

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.439 
right and left which is 324 pixels per
inch<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.160> iPad<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.410> not<00:00:49.410> retina

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
inch and the iPad which is not retina

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.729 
inch and the iPad which is not retina
which<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.870> oddly<00:00:52.020> enough<00:00:52.230> won<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
which actually oddly enough won the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.360 
which actually oddly enough won the
speed<00:00:52.949> test<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.699> boot<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:55.170> has<00:00:55.370> 163

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
speed test of the boot up and it has 163

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.220 
speed test of the boot up and it has 163
pixels<00:00:56.730> per<00:00:56.879> inch<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> let's<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pixels per inch so let's get into all of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.539 
pixels per inch so let's get into all of
them<00:01:03.260> alright<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.409> we're<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.460> we're

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
them alright so we're in now and we're

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
them alright so we're in now and we're
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> start<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going to start out by doing the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
going to start out by doing the
Geekbench<00:01:08.729> benchmark<00:01:09.630> test<00:01:13.820> go<00:01:15.170> all<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Geekbench benchmark test go all right so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
Geekbench benchmark test go all right so
the<00:01:16.470> iPads<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:16.979> behind<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.490> um<00:01:17.759> pretty

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the iPads a little behind but um pretty

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
the iPads a little behind but um pretty
much<00:01:18.479> started<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> same<00:01:19.229> times<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.189> my

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
much started all the same times so my

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
much started all the same times so my
predictions<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.720> got<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.080> running<00:01:22.470> about

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
predictions we got these running about

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.109 
predictions we got these running about
the<00:01:22.710> same<00:01:23.070> maybe<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.909> slower

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the same maybe this one a little slower

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
the same maybe this one a little slower
and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> iPhone<00:01:24.840> 5<00:01:25.110> should<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> best

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and the iPhone 5 should do the best

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
and the iPhone 5 should do the best
because<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> upgraded<00:01:27.530> internal

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
because of the upgraded internal

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:41.410 
because of the upgraded internal
specifications<00:01:36.259> alright<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> iPhone<00:01:38.450> is

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
specifications alright so the iPhone is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.730 
specifications alright so the iPhone is
having<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:42.720> impressive<00:01:42.899> score<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.560> at

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
having a pretty impressive score in at

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.050 
having a pretty impressive score in at
16<00:01:44.250> 46

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.830 

okay<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.320> iPad<00:01:53.320> Mini<00:01:53.530> got<00:01:53.680> 756<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.270> somewhat

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
okay so iPad Mini got 756 so somewhat

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
okay so iPad Mini got 756 so somewhat
respectable<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:58.660> iPod<00:01:58.960> Touch<00:01:59.170> got<00:01:59.410> 625

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
respectable and the iPod Touch got 625

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320 
respectable and the iPod Touch got 625
all<00:02:00.880> right<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:03.100> sums<00:02:03.490> up<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.910> portion

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
all right so that sums up that portion

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.300 
all right so that sums up that portion
we're<00:02:04.900> just<00:02:05.020> going<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.170> quickly<00:02:05.740> clear<00:02:06.100> out

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we're just going to quickly clear out

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.270 
we're just going to quickly clear out
stuff

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.970 

you

all<00:02:17.610> right<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.240> one<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:18.810> three

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.450 

I've<00:02:26.290> had<00:02:26.470> many<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:29.130> they're<00:02:30.130> all<00:02:30.250> done

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
I've had many one and they're all done

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.400 
I've had many one and they're all done
now<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.910> let's<00:02:31.660> scroll<00:02:31.900> around<00:02:32.200> real<00:02:32.380> quick

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
now so let's scroll around real quick

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.900 
now so let's scroll around real quick
and<00:02:32.740> they<00:02:32.950> should<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:33.220> be<00:02:33.250> able<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.520> handle<00:02:33.790> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
and they should all be able to handle it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.010 
and they should all be able to handle it
rather<00:02:34.450> well<00:02:34.860> yep<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.510> scrolling<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.690> smooth

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
rather well yep so scrolling is smooth

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.140 
rather well yep so scrolling is smooth
and<00:02:38.200> fluid<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.800> every<00:02:39.070> device<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.940> just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and fluid on every device it's just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.040 
and fluid on every device it's just
you're<00:02:40.240> going<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:40.510> some<00:02:40.630> more<00:02:40.840> screen

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
you're going to get some more screen

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
you're going to get some more screen
real<00:02:41.080> estate<00:02:41.260> obviously<00:02:41.860> I've<00:02:42.040> had<00:02:42.190> one<00:02:42.340> two

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
real estate obviously I've had one two

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:53.270 
real estate obviously I've had one two
three

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.190 

all<00:02:54.280> right<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.580> again<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.060> iPad<00:02:55.420> Mini<00:02:55.690> rolled

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
all right so again the iPad Mini rolled

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.130 
all right so again the iPad Mini rolled
out<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.440> grass<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.830> fastest<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
out the grass the fastest so that just

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.900 
out the grass the fastest so that just
shows<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.620> specs<00:03:00.250> are<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.459> everything

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
shows you that specs are on everything

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.210 
shows you that specs are on everything
the<00:03:01.270> iPad<00:03:01.630> was<00:03:01.840> faster<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.470> almost

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the iPad was faster and almost

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.820 
the iPad was faster and almost
everything<00:03:03.700> other<00:03:04.090> than<00:03:04.180> just<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.830> Geekbench

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
everything other than just the Geekbench

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.580 
everything other than just the Geekbench
results<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.020> you're<00:03:08.020> probably<00:03:08.140> not<00:03:08.380> going<00:03:08.530> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
results so you're probably not going to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.559 
results so you're probably not going to
be<00:03:08.709> deciding<00:03:09.430> whether<00:03:09.910> or<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.450> an

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
be deciding whether or not to get an

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.290 
be deciding whether or not to get an
iPad<00:03:10.930> or<00:03:11.110> an<00:03:11.260> iPhone<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.040> an<00:03:12.310> iPad<00:03:12.489> obviously

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
iPad or an iPhone and an iPad obviously

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.670 
iPad or an iPhone and an iPad obviously
because<00:03:13.540> they're<00:03:13.930> completely<00:03:14.500> different

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
because they're completely different

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.890 
because they're completely different
devices<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.280> you're<00:03:16.150> going<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.330> need<00:03:16.510> both<00:03:16.840> of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
devices and you're going to need both of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.030 
devices and you're going to need both of
them<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.470> need<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.800> phone

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
them you're going to need the phone

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.949 
them you're going to need the phone
anyway<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:18.670> you're<00:03:18.970> not<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.270> decide<00:03:19.810> to

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
anyway so you're not going to decide to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.290 
anyway so you're not going to decide to
get<00:03:20.050> an<00:03:20.140> iPad<00:03:20.380> over<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:22.120> you're

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
get an iPad over it so if you're

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.210 
get an iPad over it so if you're
deciding<00:03:22.510> between<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.080> iPad<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.860> iPod

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
deciding between the iPad and the iPod

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.630 
deciding between the iPad and the iPod
Touch<00:03:25.470> they're<00:03:26.470> relatively<00:03:26.860> close<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.430> price

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
Touch they're relatively close in price

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.860 
Touch they're relatively close in price
point<00:03:27.910> it's<00:03:28.090> just<00:03:28.209> going<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.360> depend<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.720> what

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
point it's just going to depend on what

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.810 
point it's just going to depend on what
you're<00:03:29.019> planning<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.320> use<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:30.580> that's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
you're planning to use it for so that's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.130 
you're planning to use it for so that's
about<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.150> this<00:03:31.420> video<00:03:31.690> thank<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.019> for
