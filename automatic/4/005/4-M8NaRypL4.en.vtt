00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
 all the chip, they will show themselves too Rila 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.950
 which I did myself and show an example of how 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.720
 they are made about why because 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.300
 I'm their business and and in them a lot of destructive 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.000
 questioning the prototype but this is a bug but it is not 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.430
 potato 1 trap it is primitive but 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.170
 she has marketing too 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 the button you close and falls on you 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 sledgehammer why sledgehammer kill us too 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.220
 and you can not go out bright vogue and backstage 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.119
 likes how acts on redstone from 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.119
 come here here 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.650
 interaction of the pistons of this 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.750
 the position is what you open up for whom 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.150
 there is a passage 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 it is clear everything here here too 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.140
 comes out but the diet here and everything 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.690
 he spent exactly coming to the red 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.699
 torch 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.399
 because of this he is now talking about to 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.629
 press the button it will stop burning 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.860
 because of this first level us 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.699
 Does the first one open to us? 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.280
 block off 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.300
 top view 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.290
 that is, as if 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.290
 sun to 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 and smaller paul 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.120
 although redstone and youth are up another 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.670
 a sledgehammer stand 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.440
 they have so pass it, too, will burn a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330
 when perry for them to burn to you click on 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.460
 a button 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.590
 he will fall as well as both of you 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.450
 closed you will not be able to exit become 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.140
 buttons and it will fall to the end bye 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.240
 you will not die 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 There are of course chances to give birth and redden 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.700
 he will hit but still you don't see i 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.740
 I will never 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.720
 first trap so 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 Tara, too, nothing so special 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.120
 well there is on a small point 3 to 5 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 but there is nothing like that 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.740
 for a start it was the way to do it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740
 simply 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.310
 I did not have time to do this normally 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.470
 closes see she how goes this you 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 think that the hour is open again and there is no need 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 think of making him so willing 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.780
 and you fall low you count 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.340
 the piston Nicolas will not close and you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.929
 will be 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 if you are a man go through there well 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.659
 lamb there trying to get out 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.030
 you will succeed but if 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.750
 I have not finished, so you can do it 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.730
 how will he be 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.050
 why does he close get up take a look 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.569
 he started 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.469
 because of the glory 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.469
 the main man from here 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.330
 still 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.750
 knock down 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.750
 see 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.900
 push it sharply into the diet like this 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.700
 going to scoop 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.129
 this is the first level he goes so up and 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.140
 while it burns so this is a level not 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.420
 burns when the first we will while he 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.300
 goes like this 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 from here 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.880
 here is sure to even become a thing 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.400
 here everything is clear he wants and why 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.960
 repeater because to enhance redstone 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.060
 and section 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.340
 he is not so more an epidermis amplifier 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.640
 stone where here so here is one level 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.940
 they open 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.670
 but they are still open 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.480
 to click they naturally close 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.879
 as it stops working 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.650
 and they do not work but we still 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.010
 next level vuitton is off yet 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.659
 and when you press it turns on 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.580
 Turns on when Peter I took level 2 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.260
 so also with those ok 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 interacted 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 goes down like this 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.300
 So 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.380
 they even it goes down like this and that 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.140
 here here 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.150
 when I did not finish the simpleton 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.400
 and from here 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.049
 because of this the piston opens us 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.470
 which moves a stone that is in 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.770
 turn break this 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.000
 bullshit out of this is no way to close these 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.030
 things 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.830
 pistons because of this we have a man like 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.820
 will not get out and love falls on him 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.950
 well, unless of course you break a stone either 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.500
 and don't break 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.000
 the next trap she is very good 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.129
 sly new doom kill usually 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.670
 the stairs before serving on the Werdum are very part 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.470
 study 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.090
 how to get fat omsa closes you 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.890
 walling up already there is no way to go on 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.160
 don't break the ground yet but i built 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.160
 land 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.030
 but now let's see how it works. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.880
 why break 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.880
 minuses 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.330
 Well, first show you when you say to lie down 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.130
 bed 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.980
 the wall 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.569
 here is any block 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.479
 and when you him if he is on the corner 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.359
 when leg and tobacco are all so you are 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.639
 inside lies to raise well shorter where 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.270
 is you raise it because of it 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.030
 he takes both his father and this redstone torch 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.139
 he lights up and urge all these all these 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.390
 songs well leaves him 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.400
 the very pistons 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.280
 they shut you mortar for minutes 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.090
 the fact that something disappears 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.580
 fade early 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.410
 I thought I did a little homework 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.969
 You can solve the problem so that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.459
 certain time 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.330
 Automatically in the old days filed with this 

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:56.240
 from the distributor 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.990
 I disable such a mechanism rosette 2 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.630
 any thing over there 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.870
 I change this lemon and well here here 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.500
 some things to not read 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.600
 well then know well 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.110
 cards for the ears thanks for watching 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.410
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.410
 until
