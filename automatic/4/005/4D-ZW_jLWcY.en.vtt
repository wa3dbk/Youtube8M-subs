00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 You have to give it up first 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.559

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 even easier there you can get away from here 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.690
 you can leave instead of charlotte too 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.550

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.060
 let go on so by 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 We wash the salmon first and then 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 to dice 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.660
 He just wants to chop and the small 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 You can also make shallots in cubes 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.120
 cut but I like the bit 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.520
 greater 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.350
 That's why I cut the rings 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 We will be here for a first 44 people 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.580
 Prepare and first have the noodle 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.940
 to be cooked, of course, in 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:49.610
 salt water noodles are ready now 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.610
 and can be poured off here 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.360
 You can not have the pasta for too long 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.610
 that means you have to go in between 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 always try so they do not too 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.140
 get soft but are just al dente 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.170
 and when they are submerged they can 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 but not in the pot again 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.950
 the hot stage but just 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.570
 Salmon and start with the sauce 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.300
 Whether the hottest level is the pan 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.670
 are sautéed shortly 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:47.190
 then we give the cream the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:50.120

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.120
 Mix these ingredients together 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:00.900
 as soon as the whole thing begins to boil comes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.980

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.320

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.940
 Of course , the sauce has turned yellowish 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.959
