be<00:02:20.900> perfect

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
be perfect

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.970 
be perfect

two separate parts let's look how awful
he's<00:04:45.110> done

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
he's done

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.760 
he's done
this<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.139> first<00:04:48.469> part<00:04:49.069> which<00:04:49.669> goes<00:04:50.659> on

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
this is the first part which goes on

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.589 
this is the first part which goes on
and<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.819> back<00:04:54.060> which<00:04:54.270> obviously

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
and this is the back which obviously

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.740 
and this is the back which obviously
goes<00:04:54.930> on<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.229> back<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.970> pure<00:04:57.479> white

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
goes on the back and it is so pure white

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.600 
goes on the back and it is so pure white
you<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.169> really<00:04:58.500> tell<00:04:58.770> how<00:04:58.800> white<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.400> is

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
you can really tell how white this is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.779 
you can really tell how white this is
and<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.330> love<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:01.759> so<00:05:02.759> I'm<00:05:02.819> just<00:05:03.000> gonna<00:05:03.150> snap

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:08.309 
I don't have some case in a really long

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.989 
I don't have some case in a really long
time

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:11.999 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.999 

oh<00:05:14.119> so<00:05:15.119> this<00:05:15.719> part<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.529> don't<00:05:16.589> know<00:05:16.739> if<00:05:16.799> you<00:05:16.889> can

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
oh so this part I don't know if you can

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.129 
oh so this part I don't know if you can
tell<00:05:17.249> but<00:05:17.279> this<00:05:17.579> puzzle<00:05:18.139> significantly

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
tell but this puzzle significantly

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.119 
tell but this puzzle significantly
smaller<00:05:19.769> than<00:05:20.399> this<00:05:20.579> part<00:05:20.939> and<00:05:21.829> so<00:05:22.829> the

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
smaller than this part and so the

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.069 
smaller than this part and so the
