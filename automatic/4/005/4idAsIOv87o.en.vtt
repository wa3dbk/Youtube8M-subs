00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.770 

so<00:00:15.190> at<00:00:15.310> this<00:00:15.460> point<00:00:15.850> we<00:00:16.209> can<00:00:16.390> just<00:00:16.420> use<00:00:16.750> a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
so at this point we can just use a

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.810 
so at this point we can just use a
normal<00:00:17.080> string<00:00:17.500> ratio<00:00:17.980> because<00:00:18.430> we<00:00:18.580> have<00:00:18.790> a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
normal string ratio because we have a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:39.840 
normal string ratio because we have a
right<00:00:19.119> triangle<00:00:36.780> small<00:00:37.780> segment<00:00:38.230> X<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.610> other

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
right triangle small segment X the other

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.830 
right triangle small segment X the other
segment<00:00:40.450> would<00:00:40.570> then<00:00:40.780> be<00:00:40.960> C<00:00:41.260> minus<00:00:41.440> X<00:00:42.810> so<00:00:43.810> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
segment would then be C minus X so the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:57.810 
segment would then be C minus X so the
hypotenuse<00:00:44.559> squared<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.670> equal<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:56.519> pull<00:00:57.519> that

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
hypotenuse squared is equal to pull that

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.880 
hypotenuse squared is equal to pull that
out<00:00:59.489> it'll<00:01:00.489> be<00:01:00.579> C<00:01:00.910> squared<00:01:01.269> minus<00:01:01.660> 2t<00:01:01.960> X<00:01:02.320> plus<00:01:02.649> x

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
out it'll be C squared minus 2t X plus x

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:18.640 
out it'll be C squared minus 2t X plus x
squared

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.260 

if<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.860> look<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.770> smaller<00:01:22.770> training<00:01:23.220> phone

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.990 

again<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.600> triangle<00:01:28.140> yes

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
again it's right triangle yes

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.570 
again it's right triangle yes
okay<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.680> down<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.400> work

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
okay so then back down here and I work

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:42.999 
okay so then back down here and I work
for<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.910> larger<00:01:33.210> triangle<00:01:34.700> there's<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:38.540> guess

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:52.480 

where<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.190> can<00:01:44.340> say<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:45.750> swing<00:01:51.290> now

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
where we can say that's be swing now

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.410 
where we can say that's be swing now
also<00:01:53.490> know<00:01:55.340> from<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.580> smaller<00:01:56.970> triangle

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
also know from this smaller triangle

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.960 
also know from this smaller triangle
angle<00:02:00.420> any<00:02:02.390> cosine<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> angle<00:02:03.630> theta<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.850> going

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
angle any cosine of angle theta is going

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.060 
angle any cosine of angle theta is going
to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.830> equal<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.970> adjacent<00:02:09.090> x<00:02:10.039> over<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
to be equal to the adjacent x over the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.090 
to be equal to the adjacent x over the
hypotenuse<00:02:11.730> mean
