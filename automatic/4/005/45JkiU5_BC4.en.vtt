00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.700
 let him help 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.209
 it's mid-april 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.209
 tasked to do 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 we can not 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 swiss invasion drove a lot 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.360
 Elena give buds 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 the speaker is getting worse 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.330
 these are all hemp 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.570
 we cut off pruning 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.400
 m 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.980
 last year's inflorescences 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 we prune and not here 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 Cheboksary this way 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.890
 the fact that this one here since that year 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 Shiites remained 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 just cut 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.280
 and so everything else is cut off 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 that morning absolutely uncircumcised lilac 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.650
 beetles condition 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 so here it is with us 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.580
 but we need to do about a year 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.720
 what we have already done Vitya 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.660
 internal parts of the village of Naples 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.680
 squeamishness 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.160
 it only remains 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.430
 those that hold 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.580
 and those that will bloom 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.330
 dry case old sick all this 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 announced here too 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.430
 the same 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.750
 lilacs that will soon bloom and 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.290
 make us happy 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.660
 its magnificent flowers that is 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.990
 this is about what 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.580
 already done 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.589
 this is also a sphere 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.649
 but those who are absolutely not yet us 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.279
 found ozone 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.859
 that's about 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.120
 Such were before this and the previous lilac 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.249
 so go ahead 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.599
 and don't forget 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.500
 so here is a good trim
