bit wrinkly I'm going to wait so the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.459 
bit wrinkly I'm going to wait so the
water<00:00:11.610> gets<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.090> over<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> edge<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:13.110> sandbags

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that looks like a deep end just like the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
that looks like a deep end just like the
deep<00:00:31.920> end<00:00:32.099> should<00:00:32.369> look<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.450> there's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
deep end should look and I know there's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.090 
deep end should look and I know there's
enough<00:00:34.020> material<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> edges<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> when

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
enough material over the edges so when

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
enough material over the edges so when
they<00:00:38.280> give<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> directions<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.570> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
see how we did it these are weights off

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
see how we did it these are weights off
of<00:01:13.820> Raelians<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.090> weight<00:01:15.960> machine<00:01:16.100> which<00:01:17.100> he

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of Raelians a weight machine which he

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
of Raelians a weight machine which he
ended<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.880> selling<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.420> scrap<00:01:18.720> metal<00:01:18.750> anyway

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
ended up selling for scrap metal anyway

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880 
ended up selling for scrap metal anyway
and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.460> weights<00:01:20.640> were<00:01:20.880> plastic<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.890> couldn't

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and the weights were plastic so couldn't

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
and the weights were plastic so couldn't
sell<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.490> scrap<00:01:23.580> metal<00:01:23.790> although<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
sell them for scrap metal although you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
sell them for scrap metal although you
probably<00:01:24.630> got<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.080> money<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.250> those

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
probably got a lot more money and those

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.090 
probably got a lot more money and those
are<00:01:26.430> sandbags<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.330> bought<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.750> lowes

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
are sandbags I bought at lowes

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
are sandbags I bought at lowes
twenty-five<00:01:29.100> dollars<00:01:29.369> worth<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> sandbags

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
twenty-five dollars worth of sandbags

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.940 
twenty-five dollars worth of sandbags
and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.250> i<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.729> sandbags

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
and then actually i think the sandbags

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
and then actually i think the sandbags
held<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.220> place<00:01:38.280> till<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> suction<00:01:39.329> from

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
held it in place till the suction from

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
held it in place till the suction from
the<00:01:39.659> vacuum<00:01:40.049> cleaner<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> vacuum<00:01:40.950> cleaner

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the vacuum cleaner it's a vacuum cleaner

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.969 
the vacuum cleaner it's a vacuum cleaner
here<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> background<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.110> sucked<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
here in the background kind of sucked it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
here in the background kind of sucked it
tight<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.369> against<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> edges<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
tight up against the edges and if that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
tight up against the edges and if that
water<00:01:46.470> we're<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.250> ice<00:01:47.460> cold<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
water we're not so ice cold out of the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
water we're not so ice cold out of the
pose<00:01:49.380> i<00:01:49.740> jump<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.820> working

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pose i jump right in and start working

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.999 
pose i jump right in and start working
on<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.420> rankles<00:01:51.930> cuz<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> few

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
on them rankles cuz there are a few

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.040 
on them rankles cuz there are a few
rankles

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.490 

so<00:01:56.590> that's<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.210> how<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.750> install<00:01:59.440> a

times is a charm and I don't know what a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.830 
times is a charm and I don't know what a
pool<00:02:12.670> guy<00:02:12.850> would<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.180> charged<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.630> think

can't<00:02:54.280> remember<00:02:54.310> how<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:54.730> did<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
can't remember how we did it but and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.590 
can't remember how we did it but and
since<00:02:56.770> we've<00:02:57.010> built<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.460> deck<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:58.180> around

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
since we've built this deck all around

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.100 
since we've built this deck all around
it<00:02:58.920> which<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.370> can't<00:03:00.670> really<00:03:00.880> see<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.360> deck

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
it which you can't really see the deck

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.860 
it which you can't really see the deck
and<00:03:02.770> we<00:03:02.890> try<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.130> give<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.580> full<00:03:04.030> or<00:03:04.570> anyway

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and we try to give you a full or anyway

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.150 
and we try to give you a full or anyway
it<00:03:04.930> makes<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.230> hard<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.590> get<00:03:05.739> into<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.040> edge

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
it makes it hard to get into the edge

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.550 
it makes it hard to get into the edge
and<00:03:06.459> see<00:03:06.610> those<00:03:06.730> handles<00:03:07.270> one<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> first

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and see those handles one of the first

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.590 
and see those handles one of the first
times<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.070> did<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.400> install<00:03:09.790> those<00:03:10.030> handles

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
times I did it I install those handles

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.780 
times I did it I install those handles
all<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> way<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.160> had<00:03:12.280> some<00:03:12.520> place

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
all the way around so I had some place

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.979 
all the way around so I had some place
to<00:03:12.820> kick<00:03:13.300> clip<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.680> pool<00:03:14.950> liner<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.810> could

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
to kick clip the pool liner so I could

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.930 
to kick clip the pool liner so I could
stretch<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.380> hook<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.400> those<00:03:18.610> little

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
stretch it hook it on those little

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.720 
stretch it hook it on those little
handles<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.739> kind<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.830> lower<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.190> down<00:03:21.250> into

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
handles and kind of lower it down into

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.180 
handles and kind of lower it down into
the<00:03:21.820> pool<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.360> filled<00:03:22.600> up<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.780> water

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the pool is it filled up with water

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.920 
the pool is it filled up with water
while<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> would<00:03:24.610> have<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.940> admit<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.660> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
while I would have to admit that is that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.920 
while I would have to admit that is that
is<00:03:26.080> an<00:03:26.260> excellent<00:03:26.800> excellent<00:03:27.370> idea<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.690> was

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
is an excellent excellent idea it was

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.290 
is an excellent excellent idea it was
just<00:03:29.140> not<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.350> practical<00:03:30.310> well<00:03:30.970> because

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
just not a practical well because

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.330 
just not a practical well because
they're<00:03:31.510> crap<00:03:31.870> directions<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:32.800> dropping<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
they're crap directions for dropping the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.840 
they're crap directions for dropping the
liner<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:34.709> lowering<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.950> down<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.550> at<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
liner in lowering it down a little at a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.160 
liner in lowering it down a little at a
time<00:03:37.650> they're<00:03:38.650> gay<00:03:38.920> directions<00:03:39.550> don't<00:03:39.820> work

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
time they're gay directions don't work

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.550 
time they're gay directions don't work
so<00:03:41.820> that's<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.270> it's<00:03:43.720> looking<00:03:44.110> good<00:03:44.260> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
so that's it and it's looking good and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.800 
so that's it and it's looking good and
when<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.640> water<00:03:45.850> comes<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.239> over<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.690> edge

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
when the water comes up over the edge

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.020 
when the water comes up over the edge
will<00:03:46.989> turn<00:03:47.170> them<00:03:47.290> off<00:03:47.680> work<00:03:47.920> those<00:03:48.190> wrinkles

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
will turn them off work those wrinkles

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.370 
will turn them off work those wrinkles
up<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.959> wall<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.300> well<00:03:52.300> you'll<00:03:53.050> be<00:03:53.170> swimming

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
up the wall and well you'll be swimming

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.780 
up the wall and well you'll be swimming
I<00:03:53.560> don't<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:53.980> will<00:03:54.040> be<00:03:54.160> full<00:03:54.370> with<00:03:54.580> that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
I don't think it will be full with that

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.270 
I don't think it will be full with that
hose<00:03:55.030> by<00:03:55.420> sunday<00:03:55.900> though<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.920> think

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
hose by sunday though but I think

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680 
hose by sunday though but I think
there'll<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.730> enough<00:03:57.970> water<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.360> there<00:03:58.570> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
there'll be enough water in there to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.930 
there'll be enough water in there to
swim

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
swim

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.290 
swim

deck<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> we<00:04:14.180> usually<00:04:14.570> climb<00:04:14.780> up<00:04:15.020> right<00:04:15.320> there

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
deck and we usually climb up right there

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.300 
deck and we usually climb up right there
up<00:04:16.250> onto<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.880> roof<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:18.230> can<00:04:18.380> see<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
up onto the roof you can see the the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.250 
up onto the roof you can see the the
shingles<00:04:19.730> are<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:20.030> kind<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.540> crappy<00:04:21.080> looking

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
shingles are all kind of crappy looking

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.590 
shingles are all kind of crappy looking
that's<00:04:21.980> because<00:04:22.310> we<00:04:22.460> climb<00:04:22.730> up<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.420> we

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
take the good flying leap and we jump

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.210 
take the good flying leap and we jump

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
because that electrical cord ran well

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.550 
because that electrical cord ran well

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
much like a pool liner when you get it

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.490 
much like a pool liner when you get it
done<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:10.700> free<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.570> ain't<00:05:11.840> always<00:05:11.990> perfect
