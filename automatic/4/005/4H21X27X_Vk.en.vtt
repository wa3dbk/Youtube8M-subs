00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.960 

well

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
well

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.470 
well
try<00:04:48.600> not<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.170> jump<00:04:50.100> in<00:04:50.250> smokier<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.910> know<00:04:51.120> some

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
try not to jump in smokier I know some

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.440 
try not to jump in smokier I know some
people<00:04:51.600> wanna<00:04:51.870> do<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.290> but<00:04:52.620> don't<00:04:53.070> do<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.450> and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
people wanna do that but don't do it and

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.680 
people wanna do that but don't do it and
there's<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.840> guy<00:04:55.680> who<00:04:55.740> sold<00:04:56.040> Buffalo<00:04:56.820> cycle<00:04:57.510> for

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
there's a guy who sold Buffalo cycle for

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
there's a guy who sold Buffalo cycle for
no<00:04:57.780> reason<00:04:59.420> it's<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:01.430> weird<00:05:02.430> way<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:03.170> deal<00:05:04.170> crack

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
no reason it's a weird way to deal crack

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.500 
no reason it's a weird way to deal crack
I<00:05:04.740> guess

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.870 

so<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.170> walk<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:14.860> past<00:05:15.160> until<00:05:15.430> you<00:05:15.700> see

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
so you walk to this past until you see

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:32.730 
so you walk to this past until you see
like<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:17.670> bridge

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.180 

so<00:05:33.039> we<00:05:33.610> see<00:05:33.880> like<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.509> bridge<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.710> want<00:05:36.130> to

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
so we see like a bridge and you want to

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:44.619 
so we see like a bridge and you want to
keep<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.400> circling<00:05:36.850> around

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.240 

look

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
look

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.090 
look
whoa<00:05:46.790> okay

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.940 

yeah<00:05:52.700> just<00:05:53.000> start<00:05:53.330> circling<00:05:54.020> around<00:05:54.380> until

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
yeah just start circling around until
