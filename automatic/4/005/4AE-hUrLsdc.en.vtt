nothing<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.810> realized<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.380> base<00:03:39.860> plate

to<00:03:40.250> basically<00:03:40.550> this<00:03:40.790> board<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.120> identical

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
to basically this board is identical

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.780 
to basically this board is identical
it's<00:03:42.080> just<00:03:42.910> one<00:03:43.910> tail<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:45.100> slightly

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
it's just one tail is slightly

it's just one tail is slightly

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
more squared-off than the other and

riding it either way don't even like
realize<00:03:51.859> it<00:03:52.250> sometimes<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:54.819> there's

the concave fizzle they substantially
had<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.799> concave<00:04:07.189> to<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:08.359> board<00:04:08.629> over<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
had a concave to this board over the

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.839 
had a concave to this board over the
super<00:04:09.799> shotgun<00:04:10.189> because<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.579> lot<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.730> people

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
super shotgun because a lot of people

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.759 
super shotgun because a lot of people
complaining<00:04:11.209> there<00:04:11.629> was<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.959> no<00:04:12.140> concave<00:04:12.620> at

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
complaining there was like no concave at

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.460 
complaining there was like no concave at
all<00:04:12.889> and<00:04:13.670> they<00:04:16.870> made<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.959> drop<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.229> little

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
all and they made the drop a little

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.499 
all and they made the drop a little
steeper<00:04:19.060> which<00:04:20.060> i<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.940> just<00:04:23.000> hugs<00:04:23.360> your

yeah I'll definitely post a another
review<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.860> board<00:05:01.159> that's<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:02.000> know<00:05:02.150> a

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
review of this board that's you know a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.939 
review of this board that's you know a
few<00:05:03.070> weeks<00:05:04.070> later<00:05:04.490> after<00:05:04.880> I've<00:05:05.240> ridden<00:05:05.539> it

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
few weeks later after I've ridden it

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.050 
few weeks later after I've ridden it
substantially<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.070> really<00:05:07.370> get<00:05:07.909> to<00:05:08.030> feel

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
substantially and I really get to feel

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.659 
substantially and I really get to feel
the<00:05:08.449> board<00:05:08.690> but<00:05:08.930> um<00:05:09.199> so<00:05:09.860> far<00:05:10.130> it's<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.340> five<00:05:10.520> out

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
the board but um so far it's a five out

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.080 
the board but um so far it's a five out
