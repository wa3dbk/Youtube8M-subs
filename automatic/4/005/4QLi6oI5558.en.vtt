00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
start knitting in the round so they're

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
start knitting in the round so they're
just<00:02:29.150> joined<00:02:29.569> up<00:02:29.870> they're<00:02:30.260> all<00:02:30.410> set<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.709> go<00:02:30.890> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
just joined up they're all set to go I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.320 
just joined up they're all set to go I
can<00:02:31.160> show<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.549> more<00:02:31.580> time<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.060> here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
can show you one more time to see here

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.570 
can show you one more time to see here
they're<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.660> joined<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.350> have<00:02:33.799> three<00:02:34.160> needles

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
they're not joined I have three needles

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.400 
they're not joined I have three needles
and<00:02:34.940> they're<00:02:35.060> forming<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.540> triangle<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
and they're forming that triangle that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.009 
and they're forming that triangle that
you<00:02:36.470> want<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.830> see<00:02:37.100> they're<00:02:37.819> not<00:02:37.970> twisted<00:02:38.720> and

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
you want to see they're not twisted and

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.809 
you want to see they're not twisted and
then<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.410> will<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.709> go<00:02:39.920> ahead<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.489> start

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
then I will just go ahead and start

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.280 
then I will just go ahead and start
knitting<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.299> first<00:02:41.630> round<00:02:47.080> I'll<00:02:48.080> move<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
knitting that first round I'll move to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.750 
knitting that first round I'll move to
the<00:02:48.560> next<00:02:48.799> one

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.070 

and<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.819> just<00:02:53.030> leave<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.209> end<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> just

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
and I just leave that end out I just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.530 
and I just leave that end out I just
find<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.440> easier<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.099> just<00:02:55.310> take<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
find it really easier to just take the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.210 
find it really easier to just take the
end<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> yarn<00:02:57.380> needle<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.799> close<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.190> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
end on a yarn needle to close up that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.900 
end on a yarn needle to close up that
hole<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.049> to<00:03:00.049> me<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.680> lot<00:03:01.430> easier<00:03:01.489> than

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
hole that to me is a lot easier than

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.870 
hole that to me is a lot easier than
doing<00:03:02.329> some<00:03:02.720> kind<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.049> fiddly<00:03:03.290> cast<00:03:04.190> on<00:03:04.489> where

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
doing some kind of fiddly cast on where

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.630 
doing some kind of fiddly cast on where
you<00:03:05.260> weave<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.470> ended<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.040> then<00:03:07.130> pull<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.519> up

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
you weave that ended and then pull it up

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.259 
you weave that ended and then pull it up
closed<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.510> don't<00:03:09.440> mind<00:03:09.590> doing<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:09.890> at<00:03:10.160> all

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.640
