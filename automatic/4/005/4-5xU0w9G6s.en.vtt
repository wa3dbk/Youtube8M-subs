00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
so I just got this piston mod actually

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.140 
so I just got this piston mod actually
created<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.799> world<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> test<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.029> out

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
created a world just to test it out

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.460 
created a world just to test it out
there's<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.569> many<00:00:06.779> things<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.379> with

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
there's so many things you can do with

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.709 
there's so many things you can do with
it<00:00:07.940> I've<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.120> been<00:00:09.269> spending<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> past

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it I've just been spending the past

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.480 
it I've just been spending the past
couple<00:00:10.139> days<00:00:10.320> trying<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> figure<00:00:10.889> out<00:00:10.920> uses

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
couple days trying to figure out uses

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.519 
couple days trying to figure out uses
and<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:12.059> making<00:00:12.809> them<00:00:13.139> um<00:00:15.529> apparently

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and actually making them um apparently

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.740 
and actually making them um apparently
Jeb<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.130> hopefully<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.270> adding<00:00:18.420> them

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
Jeb is hopefully going to be adding them

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.810 
Jeb is hopefully going to be adding them
into<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.080> game<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.980> sure<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.580> though

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
into the game not sure about that though

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.910 
into the game not sure about that though
hopefully<00:00:21.810> does<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> really

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
hopefully does because this is a really

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
hopefully does because this is a really
great<00:00:23.010> mod<00:00:23.310> it'd<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.269> fun<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
great mod it'd be really fun and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
great mod it'd be really fun and
multiplayer<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.130> uh<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:27.060> i'm<00:00:27.210> going

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
multiplayer but uh basically i'm going

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
multiplayer but uh basically i'm going
to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.449> showing<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> things<00:00:29.010> i've

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
to be showing some of the things i've

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400 
to be showing some of the things i've
been<00:00:29.400> building<00:00:29.660> there's<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.869> many<00:00:30.960> more<00:00:31.080> uses

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
been building there's so many more uses

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100 
been building there's so many more uses
than<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.859> i've<00:00:31.980> been<00:00:32.009> doing<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.930> i'm<00:00:33.930> just

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
than what i've been doing but i'm just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
than what i've been doing but i'm just
going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> few<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.460> i've

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
going to show some of the few that i've

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
going to show some of the few that i've
come<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.000> i<00:00:36.920> actually<00:00:37.920> saw<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> one

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
come up with i actually saw this in one

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.959 
come up with i actually saw this in one
of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> videos<00:00:40.070> showing<00:00:41.070> off<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.430> mod<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
of the videos showing off this mod and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.310 
of the videos showing off this mod and
my<00:00:42.180> actual<00:00:42.480> next<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.989> too<00:00:43.640> um<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.989> lava<00:00:45.989> bridge

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
my actual next one too um a lava bridge

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
my actual next one too um a lava bridge
and<00:00:47.360> anything<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.390> uses<00:00:48.920> switches<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and anything that uses switches in this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.500 
and anything that uses switches in this
video<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:52.320> uses<00:00:52.710> XOR<00:00:53.190> gates<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:54.300> means

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
video also uses XOR gates which means

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
video also uses XOR gates which means
that<00:00:54.600> no<00:00:55.020> matter<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.590> flip<00:00:56.129> it'll

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that no matter which one you flip it'll

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
that no matter which one you flip it'll
toggle<00:00:57.000> it<00:01:00.590> also<00:01:01.590> show<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.239> redstone<00:01:03.619> what<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
toggle it also show the redstone what I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.270 
toggle it also show the redstone what I
did<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> red<00:01:05.220> stone<00:01:05.460> were<00:01:05.729> possible

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
did with the red stone were possible

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
did with the red stone were possible
some<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> its<00:01:08.580> buried<00:01:09.240> underground<00:01:09.510> stuff

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
some of its buried underground stuff

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
some of its buried underground stuff
where<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> can't<00:01:10.439> reach<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.040> it'd<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.189> kind<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
where I can't reach so it'd be kind of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
where I can't reach so it'd be kind of
difficult<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.880> show<00:01:13.670> next<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:16.470> got

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
difficult to show next over here we got

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.550 
difficult to show next over here we got
this<00:01:16.650> large<00:01:17.549> sand<00:01:18.479> snake<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.439> guess

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this large sand snake thing I guess

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.289 
this large sand snake thing I guess
you'd<00:01:19.710> call<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.119> um<00:01:22.670> what<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you'd call it um what I do this this

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.640 
you'd call it um what I do this this
actually<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> while<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> figure<00:01:25.470> out

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
actually took me a while to figure out

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
actually took me a while to figure out
the<00:01:25.740> design<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.250> cuz<00:01:26.490> uh<00:01:28.490> issues<00:01:29.490> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the design for cuz uh issues with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
the design for cuz uh issues with
redstone<00:01:30.000> getting<00:01:30.360> attached<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> other

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
redstone getting attached to other

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
redstone getting attached to other
redstone<00:01:33.950> every<00:01:34.950> time<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.479> sends<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> signal

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
redstone every time a sends a signal

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
redstone every time a sends a signal
through<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.500> comes<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.950> loops

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
through it actually comes back loops

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.780 
through it actually comes back loops
back<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.970> sends<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> next<00:01:40.020> one

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
back and sends it on to the next one

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.039 
back and sends it on to the next one
meaning<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.420> basically<00:01:42.630> be

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
meaning that this can basically be

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.679 
meaning that this can basically be
infinitely<00:01:43.560> long<00:01:43.890> while<00:01:44.670> still<00:01:44.939> retaining

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
infinitely long while still retaining

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:55.670 
infinitely long while still retaining
the<00:01:46.170> same<00:01:46.439> size<00:01:46.799> /<00:01:47.369> piston

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:06.149 

over<00:01:56.680> here<00:01:57.159> I<00:01:59.310> made<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:01.440> tnt<00:02:02.440> cannon<00:02:02.470> ah<00:02:05.159> you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
over here I made a tnt cannon ah you

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.800 
over here I made a tnt cannon ah you
press<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.520> button<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.850> ignites<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.360> TNT<00:02:07.720> it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
press the button it ignites the TNT it

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.600 
press the button it ignites the TNT it
drops<00:02:08.080> down<00:02:08.200> piston<00:02:08.860> fires<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.250> up<00:02:09.310> that

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
drops down piston fires it up that

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.059 
drops down piston fires it up that
piston<00:02:09.940> fires<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.380> see<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.860> being

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
piston fires it out and see that being

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.660 
piston fires it out and see that being
very<00:02:15.489> useful<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.510> multiplayer<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.739> wars<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
very useful in a multiplayer in wars and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.440 
very useful in a multiplayer in wars and
other<00:02:18.940> situations<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.980> uh<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.910> kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.270> take

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
other situations but uh it kind of take

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.210 
other situations but uh it kind of take
a<00:02:22.480> little<00:02:22.660> while<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.020> build<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.440> from

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
a little while to build this from

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.690 
a little while to build this from
scratch<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> decided<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.920> make<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.100> more

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
scratch so I decided to make a more

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.540 
scratch so I decided to make a more
compact<00:02:28.180> version<00:02:28.540> which<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.010> very<00:02:30.010> small<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
compact version which is very small and

compact version which is very small and
easy<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> bank<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.310> ignite<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760
