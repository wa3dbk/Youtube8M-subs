00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
now the problem with this is as you can

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
now the problem with this is as you can
see<00:01:20.939> I've<00:01:21.060> already<00:01:21.210> killed<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.720> killed<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
see I've already killed I killed a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
see I've already killed I killed a
hundred<00:01:22.170> thousand<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:22.890> re<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> sentient

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
hundred thousand or re so a sentient

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.740 
hundred thousand or re so a sentient
creatures<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.920> maxes<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.520> 60<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.600> I've

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
creatures and it maxes out at 60 so I've

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
creatures and it maxes out at 60 so I've
already<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> t-1000<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.430> I've<00:01:29.820> only

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
already got a t-1000 and I've only

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
already got a t-1000 and I've only
killed<00:01:30.350> 15,000<00:01:31.350> Slayer<00:01:31.530> monsters<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
killed 15,000 Slayer monsters so that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.109 
killed 15,000 Slayer monsters so that
technically<00:01:33.540> doesn't<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.680> work<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.460> if

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
technically doesn't really work if if

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.370 
technically doesn't really work if if
that<00:01:36.390> makes<00:01:36.600> any<00:01:36.689> sense<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that makes any sense so you know it is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
that makes any sense so you know it is
what<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.820> plus<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.450> be

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
what it is plus I think there might be

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.060 
what it is plus I think there might be
some<00:01:42.840> slower<00:01:43.079> monsters<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.590> aren't<00:01:43.799> even<00:01:43.979> on

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
some slower monsters that aren't even on

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.289 
some slower monsters that aren't even on
here<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.810> black<00:01:45.810> dragons<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:48.210> know

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
here like black dragons and I don't know

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.719 
here like black dragons and I don't know
if<00:01:48.420> hellhounds<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:50.009> anything

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
if hellhounds are on here or anything

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.030 
if hellhounds are on here or anything
like<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.649> monsters

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
like that so there are some monsters

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.359 
like that so there are some monsters
that<00:01:53.189> aren't<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.790> anyway<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:56.070> hard

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that aren't on here anyway so it's hard

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
that aren't on here anyway so it's hard
