00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
me how much they managed to push the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
me how much they managed to push the
envelope<00:00:45.870> forward<00:00:46.500> dynamically<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
envelope forward dynamically with the

envelope forward dynamically with the
new<00:00:48.000> came<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.989> did<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> 911

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
new came and they did it with the 911

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.840 
new came and they did it with the 911
they<00:00:49.860> did<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> box<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> shouldn't

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
they did with a box that we shouldn't

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
they did with a box that we shouldn't
really<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> surprised<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.440> time

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
really be surprised but they do it time

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
really be surprised but they do it time
and<00:00:52.829> again<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.100> mean<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.449> manage<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and again I mean the way they manage to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
and again I mean the way they manage to
somehow<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.770> reach<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.879> driver's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
somehow just reach into a driver's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479 
somehow just reach into a driver's
psyche<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.320> exactly<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.219> wants

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
psyche and know exactly what he wants

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
psyche and know exactly what he wants
from<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> performance<00:01:00.210> car<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.840> deliver

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
from a performance car and then deliver

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.910 
from a performance car and then deliver
it<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:02.899> there<00:01:03.899> without<00:01:04.049> peer<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> world

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it it's there without peer in the world

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.690 
it it's there without peer in the world
I<00:01:11.450> think<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> those<00:01:13.110> classic

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
I think that's just one of those classic

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
I think that's just one of those classic
driver<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> car<00:01:15.470> really<00:01:16.470> involving

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
driver and car really involving
