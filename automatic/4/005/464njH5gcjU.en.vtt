00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270 

okay<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:01.140> moving<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.620> from<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.949> design

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
okay so moving on from the design

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.450 
okay so moving on from the design
process<00:00:02.610> I'm<00:00:03.210> now<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> show<00:00:03.870> you

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
process I'm now going to show you

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.039 
process I'm now going to show you
physically<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:05.940> pressing<00:00:06.480> these<00:00:06.629> plates

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
physically how I'm pressing these plates

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.009 
physically how I'm pressing these plates
into<00:00:07.379> shape<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.220> make<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.700> lampshade<00:00:09.360> section

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
into shape to make the lampshade section

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.129 
into shape to make the lampshade section
of<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.860> torch<00:00:11.190> which<00:00:12.090> eventually<00:00:12.509> should

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
of this torch which eventually should

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.860 
of this torch which eventually should
look<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.500> something<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.809> I'm

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
look like something like this so I'm

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.910 
look like something like this so I'm
going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.049> run<00:00:16.230> through<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> process<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
going to run through the process that

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.240 
going to run through the process that
I've<00:00:17.160> used<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.359> basically<00:00:19.289> got

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I've used to do this and basically got

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
I've used to do this and basically got
my<00:00:20.369> flat<00:00:20.580> plates<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.140> first<00:00:22.380> thing

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
my flat plates here and the first thing

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.640 
my flat plates here and the first thing
I<00:00:22.680> need<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.369> bend<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:24.150> into<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:25.109> shape

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I need to do is bend them into a shape

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
I need to do is bend them into a shape
here<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.340> makes<00:00:26.519> them<00:00:26.670> easier<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> press<00:00:27.560> on

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
here that makes them easier to press on

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.429 
here that makes them easier to press on
this<00:00:29.099> press<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.760> I've<00:00:29.910> made<00:00:30.150> myself<00:00:30.480> which

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this press that I've made myself which

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.900 
this press that I've made myself which
is<00:00:31.470> walnut<00:00:32.099> wood<00:00:32.570> cut<00:00:33.570> using<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.230> band<00:00:34.410> tool

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
is walnut wood cut using a band tool

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
is walnut wood cut using a band tool
basically<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.390> create<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> bit<00:00:37.170> like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
basically you can create it's a bit like

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
basically you can create it's a bit like
a<00:00:37.320> jigsaw<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> create<00:00:38.460> quite<00:00:38.820> intricate

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a jigsaw to create quite intricate

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
a jigsaw to create quite intricate
patterns<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
patterns and as you can see from the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
patterns and as you can see from the
side<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.300> profile<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.680> shapes

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
side that's a profile of these shapes

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.299 
side that's a profile of these shapes
that<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.340> making<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> I'm

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that I'm making and so to do that I'm

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.090 
that I'm making and so to do that I'm
going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> spike<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.500> steel

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
going to spike here with two steel

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to spike here with two steel
plates<00:00:51.110> basically<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> small<00:00:52.559> jig<00:00:52.770> I've

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
plates basically it's a small jig I've

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
plates basically it's a small jig I've
just<00:00:53.129> welded<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> allows<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.020> line

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
just welded up and it allows me to line

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
just welded up and it allows me to line
it<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> perforations<00:00:59.670> I've

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it up with the perforations I've

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
it up with the perforations I've
designed<00:01:00.539> into<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.199> metal<00:01:01.590> plates<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
designed into these metal plates that I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
designed into these metal plates that I
can<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:03.000> bend<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> allows<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.909> metal

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
can then bend it so it allows the metal

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.789 
can then bend it so it allows the metal
depend<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:06.930> place<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> put<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
depend in the right place when I put it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.460 
depend in the right place when I put it
into<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> press<00:01:08.960> means<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.200> having<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
into the press means I'm not having to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.039 
into the press means I'm not having to
put<00:01:10.590> loads<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> pressure<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.540> press<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
put loads of pressure on the press in

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
put loads of pressure on the press in
which<00:01:13.350> case<00:01:13.560> which<00:01:13.979> could<00:01:14.189> break<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.700> because

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which case which could break it because

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
which case which could break it because
in<00:01:16.430> alternative<00:01:17.430> ways<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.850> doing<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in alternative ways of doing this you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
in alternative ways of doing this you
could<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.689> metal<00:01:19.080> press<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.650> quite

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
could have a metal press which is quite

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.080 
could have a metal press which is quite
expensive<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> would<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> be

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
expensive because it would have to be

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
expensive because it would have to be
made<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> steel<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.810> cast<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
made out of steel and cast and so this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
made out of steel and cast and so this
is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.180> homemade<00:01:25.110> job<00:01:25.670> by<00:01:26.670> claire<00:01:27.080> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
is a bit of a homemade job by claire but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.270 
is a bit of a homemade job by claire but
actually<00:01:28.409> does<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> job<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.009> there's<00:01:29.130> only

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actually does the job and there's only

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
actually does the job and there's only
20<00:01:30.200> 112<00:01:31.200> plates<00:01:31.560> anyway<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.150> it's<00:01:33.150> fine<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
20 112 plates anyway so it's fine but it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.249 
20 112 plates anyway so it's fine but it
just<00:01:34.470> takes<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.040> bit<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> energy<00:01:36.259> anyway

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just takes a little bit of energy anyway

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.670 
just takes a little bit of energy anyway
so<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:39.000> goes<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> press<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so this now goes into the press that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.240 
so this now goes into the press that
I've<00:01:40.829> made<00:01:45.049> which<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> screw<00:01:47.070> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I've made which I'm going to screw in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.910 
I've made which I'm going to screw in
place<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> won't<00:01:48.479> move<00:01:48.750> once<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
place because then it won't move once I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.970 
place because then it won't move once I
put<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> pressure<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> vise

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:07.480 

a<00:01:55.070> little<00:01:55.910> bit<00:01:56.030> makeshift<00:02:06.010> just<00:02:07.010> put<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.340> bit

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
a little bit makeshift just put in a bit

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.800 
a little bit makeshift just put in a bit
of<00:02:07.580> pressure<00:02:07.820> on<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.150> and<00:02:08.180> then<00:02:08.390> putting<00:02:08.660> it

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
of pressure on it and then putting it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:25.720 
of pressure on it and then putting it
straight<00:02:08.930> into<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.640> vise<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:24.730> basically

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
straight into the vise and basically

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.970 
straight into the vise and basically
I've<00:02:25.910> got<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.120> long<00:02:26.330> hole<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.440> help<00:02:27.650> me<00:02:27.770> put

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
I've got a long hole here to help me put

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.440 
I've got a long hole here to help me put
some<00:02:28.130> extra<00:02:28.460> pressure<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.820> not<00:02:29.000> too<00:02:29.210> much

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
some extra pressure on not too much

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.320 
some extra pressure on not too much
because<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.170> could<00:02:30.620> actually<00:02:30.740> break<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.820> quest

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
because I could actually break a quest

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.170 
because I could actually break a quest
which<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.720> want<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.610> using

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
which and I want to but this just using

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.540 
which and I want to but this just using
this<00:02:35.270> lever<00:02:35.510> allows<00:02:35.990> me<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> pivot<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:37.040> extra

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
this lever allows me to pivot that extra

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.280 
this lever allows me to pivot that extra
bit<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.760> pressure<00:02:38.000> which<00:02:38.270> will<00:02:38.870> completely

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
bit of pressure which will completely

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.600 
bit of pressure which will completely
form<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.920> sheet<00:02:40.220> steel<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:41.000> me

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.960 

so<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.820> then<00:02:46.940> take<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.330> out<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.970> hopefully

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
so we then take it out and hopefully

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:05.230 
so we then take it out and hopefully
it's<00:02:50.150> pressed<00:03:02.020> like<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.820> I'm<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.090> going

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's pressed like so so I'm just going

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960 
it's pressed like so so I'm just going
to<00:03:05.300> do<00:03:05.450> now<00:03:05.840> another<00:03:06.170> 111<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.040> those<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.580> then

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
to do now another 111 of those and then

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.280 
to do now another 111 of those and then
I'll<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.240> you<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> spot<00:03:08.900> welder

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I'll see you in with the spot welder

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.330 
I'll see you in with the spot welder
where<00:03:09.530> I'm<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.800> spot<00:03:09.950> weld<00:03:10.130> them

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
where I'm going to spot weld them

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.520 
where I'm going to spot weld them
together
