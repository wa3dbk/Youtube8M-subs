were to play as him so he will have aqua
which<00:00:17.970> means<00:00:18.210> melee<00:00:18.869> units<00:00:19.020> cost<00:00:19.380> fifty

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
which means melee units cost fifty

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
which means melee units cost fifty
percent<00:00:19.980> less<00:00:20.160> maintenance<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.970> units

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
percent less maintenance all units

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.120 
percent less maintenance all units
required<00:00:21.960> twenty-five<00:00:22.529> percent<00:00:22.680> less

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
required twenty-five percent less

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.150 
required twenty-five percent less
experience<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> earn<00:00:24.090> their<00:00:24.300> next<00:00:24.359> promotion

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
experience to earn their next promotion

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.490 
experience to earn their next promotion
which<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> huge<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.810> guy<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:27.990> all

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
which is huge because this guy is all

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
which is huge because this guy is all
about<00:00:29.070> being<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.210> dominant<00:00:30.599> force<00:00:32.090> again<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
about being a dominant force again I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
about being a dominant force again I
mean<00:00:33.510> melee<00:00:33.840> units<00:00:34.020> cost<00:00:34.320> percent<00:00:34.890> less

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
mean melee units cost percent less

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
mean melee units cost percent less
maintenance<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.880> pretty<00:00:36.750> much<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.140> an

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
maintenance you can pretty much have an

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.479 
maintenance you can pretty much have an
entire<00:00:38.100> landscape<00:00:38.579> filled<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.329> melee<00:00:39.840> units

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
entire landscape filled with melee units

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.799 
entire landscape filled with melee units
and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:41.579> also<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.300> twenty-five<00:00:42.690> percent

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and then also the twenty-five percent

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
and then also the twenty-five percent
less<00:00:43.140> experience<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> earn<00:00:43.860> their<00:00:43.980> next

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
less experience to earn their next

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.450 
less experience to earn their next
promotion<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.760> huge<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> mean<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.770> guys<00:00:46.829> are

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
promotion is huge I mean these guys are

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.940 
promotion is huge I mean these guys are
a<00:00:47.489> force<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.210> reckoned<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
a force to be reckoned with and if you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.139 
a force to be reckoned with and if you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
have all the barracks and in this case

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.900 
have all the barracks and in this case
you<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> should<00:00:54.989> say<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> conda's<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.219> other
