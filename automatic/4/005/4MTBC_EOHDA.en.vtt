00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
nice odd numbers as the third receiver

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.570 
nice odd numbers as the third receiver
and<00:03:09.630> before<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.200> Brandon<00:03:10.800> Stokley<00:03:11.010> didn't

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
do half bad either so is it a bad pic to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.140
