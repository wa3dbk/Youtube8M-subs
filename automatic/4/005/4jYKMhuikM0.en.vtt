00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.920
 more than six months 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 I even wanted to let me grow 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.760
 the whiskers and the hoflack is in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 tribute to the heroes of the game who sport 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 costumes and trucks straight out 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.890
 from the Victorian era 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 then I thought it was going to be 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.560
 a little too fan boy have hipster what 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.359
 be it 0 order 1886 is there and he 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 is up to what was expected 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.430
 it's even a step up for everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.649
 tell you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 like a majestic airship that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 would float above the competition 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 so big balloons balloons ready to get 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.239
 deflate or true worship game that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 will mark the history of the video game 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.000
 Well, I suggest you see that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.000
 together I have my little idea 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.090
 it's not every day that we attend 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 the birth of a new license in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.680
 the video game is in my opinion I you the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.600
 tell net if order 1886 is gone 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.580
 to last as uncharted 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 before him other excluded playstation who 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.720
 marked the history of the console and the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 video game as certainly the heroes of 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.800
 life gold dare not the handsome kid side 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.690
 nathan drake but they have the charm 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.210
 of their time and should not leave 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 the insensitive feminine 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 that they are real knights 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 romantic devil servants who 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 bear names that commands respect 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.009
 as gilbert dumotier of the fayette 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 sister galade or perceval that of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.740
 Knights of the round table a step 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 the one of the kaamelott series 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.399
 the female is also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.770
 worthily represented paris grain also 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.509
 charming that resolved all are part 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 of a knight brotherhood in charge of 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.049
 fight the forces of evil since the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.070
 night time 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.720
 small group watches over an empire 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.789
 British who looks very much like the one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 of the Victorian era but boosted by a 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.380
 industrial revolution that survived 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 offers technological innovations that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 will only historically happen well 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 later the hackles rub shoulders with 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 zeppelins the oil lamps sound 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 look tell by the inventions 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.619
 Revolutionary Electric Nikola 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.479
 tesla and the knight are equipped with 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.470
 clever system that allows them to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.929
 see the night as in daylight 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 hacking devices 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.610
 mercury and an arsenal that would not deny 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 not the last and call of duty advanced 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 warfare in addition to vintage blunderbuss 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 you have a sniper rifle 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
 machine guns or weapons more 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 strange like this rifle that sway at 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.390
 away a cloud of particles that you 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.209
 can then ignite with a second 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 third arsenal is supplemented by various 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.620
 drug and elixir flasks that allow 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 to heal yourself instantly 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.010
 to increase his abilities so 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.660
 safe natural way to be able by 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.130
 example locked multiple targets 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 as if the action was taking place 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.629
 suddenly idling 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.159
 against werewolves and other inhuman 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.420
 lurking in the dark alleys of 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.069
 london and facing the enemies of the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.430
 monarchy who are trying to overthrow the 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.049
 diet 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 sometimes you have to know how to play 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.890
 card of discretion and the knight 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.769
 are also infiltration experts 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.390
 and in discrete elimination only small 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.860
 disappointment melee combat 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.510
 is that you often using quick 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920
 time events which is a bit of a mess 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.180
 when we see that the engine of the game is 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.310
 able to pass a sequence 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.420
 kinematic to an action sequence without 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.420
 the slightest graphic break 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 for the rest the next gen gives all his 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.959
 measure with splendid decorations of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.940
 incredibly realistic textures the leather 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.950
 fabric reflections on the copper 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.900
 especially are bluffing windows that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.880
 is very realistically broken and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.330
 flame effects or explosion to cut 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.580
 the breath 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.709
 I bathe permanently in a light 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.180
 slightly foggy with fine 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.640
 particles that gives it a mood 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 really special often reinforced by 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.600
 vintage music or play the piano 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.340
 cello and the characters seem 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.230
 really alive with attitudes and 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.750
 incredibly human mimicry 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.310
 even when you do not touch the manna 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.560
 little gesture a look are enough to make 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.080
 the credible character besides this 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.510
 delicious little French accent that makes 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.070
 the charm of some dialogues 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.500
 in short we can only fall under the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.819
 zealand charm hours 1886 and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.680
 desired a long life to these 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.170
 endearing characters and his universe 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.850
 surprising steampunk in those times when the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.230
 suites suites suites suites 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.880
 suites are in the tens 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.080
 it feels good to be able to leave 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.080
 explore a totally new world 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.330
 whip generation
