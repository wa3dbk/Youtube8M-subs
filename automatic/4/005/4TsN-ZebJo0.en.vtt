channel<00:00:35.100> equalizer<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.350> believe<00:00:37.350> that's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
channel equalizer I believe that's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.180 
channel equalizer I believe that's
pyramid<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> best<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.950> man<00:00:40.950> does

pyramid it's not the best but man does

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
pyramid it's not the best but man does

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
an okay decent job for now this will be

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.440 
an okay decent job for now this will be

it's<00:01:07.229> actually<00:01:07.760> pretty<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:09.000> i<00:01:09.060> mean<00:01:09.450> i<00:01:09.659> would

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's actually pretty good i mean i would

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's actually pretty good i mean i would
like<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.159> know<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.340> oxygens<00:01:12.060> eventually

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
like to you know get oxygens eventually

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
like to you know get oxygens eventually
but<00:01:13.500> uh<00:01:13.560> anyway<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.310> mean<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.640> sound<00:01:14.880> good<00:01:15.030> for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
but uh anyway I mean they sound good for

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.140 
but uh anyway I mean they sound good for
now<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> pyle<00:01:17.369> pro<00:01:17.400> three

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
now and then you have the pyle pro three

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.770 
now and then you have the pyle pro three
and<00:01:18.270> three-quarter<00:01:18.720> inch<00:01:18.869> bold<00:01:19.740> horn<00:01:20.009> tweeter

have to take my word for it it's right

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
have to take my word for it it's right
under<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.150> where<00:01:39.329> they're<00:01:40.070> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> trunk

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
under there where they're in the trunk

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.950 
under there where they're in the trunk
you<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:43.170> marine<00:01:43.500> battery<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.579> i

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
you have my marine battery which i

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
you have my marine battery which i
eventually<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.320> change<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.130> either<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
eventually will change out to either a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
eventually will change out to either a
kinetic<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.840> excess<00:01:49.200> power<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.439> 0

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

power acoustik 3000 watt for the sub and

power acoustik 3000 watt for the sub and
it's<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:52.440> running<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.010> sub<00:02:53.340> right<00:02:53.549> now

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it's actually running the sub right now

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.039 
it's actually running the sub right now
at<00:02:54.030> one<00:02:54.450> point<00:02:55.940> no<00:02:56.940> I'm<00:02:57.090> wrong<00:02:57.329> two<00:02:57.569> point<00:02:57.840> four

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
at one point no I'm wrong two point four

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.849 
at one point no I'm wrong two point four
ohms<00:02:58.640> instead<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.790> 0<00:03:00.390> point<00:03:01.349> six<00:03:01.650> albums

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
ohms instead of 0 point six albums

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.289 
ohms instead of 0 point six albums
because<00:03:02.069> it's<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> 1.2<00:03:02.970> dual<00:03:03.739> coil<00:03:04.739> sub<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:06.150> if<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
because it's a 1.2 dual coil sub so if I

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
because it's a 1.2 dual coil sub so if I
ever<00:03:06.390> get<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.629> half<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.959> them<00:03:07.049> stable<00:03:07.379> amp<00:03:07.590> you

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
ever get a half of them stable amp you

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.210 
ever get a half of them stable amp you
know<00:03:08.430> I'm<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.269> do<00:03:09.359> that<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.590> yeah<00:03:10.799> this

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
know I'm going to do that so yeah this
