00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello this video will be about this one here 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.350
 our victor nose which I did 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.080
 lining in general now the preface 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 I have some technical stuff here 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 problems i mean i have a weak computer 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 I can't make a good video like 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 wish i wanted to do voice over 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.279
 text in general, I replaced the music further 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 there will be a video right now where i'm doing these 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 lining that is sawing you to the plague and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.359
 blah blah blah in general all the further themselves 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 see tell me nothing 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.710
 going in general let's watch the video 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.489
 and then later I watch the video 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 I will be with you again 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.140
 m 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.470
 and 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.959
 and 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.959
 and 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.099
 and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.870
 and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.790
 and 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.790
 and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.260
 and 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.500
 but you saw the video as you see 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.500
 that's what happened but it turned out like this 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.130
 here is the result I really like it all 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.900
 let 's say a few more words i'm very 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.370
 of course yes upset that no no well no 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.470
 It turned out as I wanted to do 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.810
 off-screen text ie comments 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.000
 Well, God forbid I have everything in the near future 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.730
 I'll get better then lay it out again 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.820
 video in which be here already 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.650
 comments 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:56.550
 Now I will show you this knife macro so 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.980
 tell the mode to close here now 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.320
 I will show you but what to say and 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.630
 the blade here I did nothing soon 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.410
 future plans and such here 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.190
 it turns out 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.180
 material is textolite or else myocardium 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:17.880
 if i'm not mistaken this is the same thing in 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.450
 In general, here is such a structure here 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.610
 probably not a little bit improved but 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.550
 generally I do not like it and so we 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.860
 probably the first result that I 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.550
 made a carved lining hole here 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.880
 see which I did technically so 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.460
 say holes that are not very nice i 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.080
 tried to paint this myocardium dye and 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.200
 with ink 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.130
 ink that is poured into the printer 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.010
 jet 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:53.730
 but this paint quickly washed off and then in 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:57.660
 general and it all so that it does not 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.280
 It may be something else so 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.500
 Further here I still plan to do 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.300
 notches on the knife but this is in the near future 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.300
 if I do, I will definitely do it 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.790
 video and post it on youtube 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.070
 what else to say well probably more 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.150
 nothing to say that's so short 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:22.560
 the video that I will make the video was 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.600
 shot in September shot she was there 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.610
 September 20 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.599
 and now in 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:34.590
 November 17, then the clock will show in general 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:37.819
 can take my word for it so here 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.259
 so long I could not make it all video 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.150
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.430
 be sure to comment on this video 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.710
 what you didn't like and what you liked 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:51.360
 for me it is very important and indeed for 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.439
 everyone who makes a video is important at all 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.960

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:59.960
 so like you all bye
