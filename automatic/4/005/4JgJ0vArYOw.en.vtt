00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 Renault symbol engine 1 and 4 sometimes times 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.120
 Six months there is such a situation that the car 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.120
 just won't start 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.279
 as a result of research it was found out 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 that the ignition coil does not come 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 control signal i.e. plus 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.340
 constantly here and by cons when 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.500
 a minus signal comes from 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 the crane coils out extremely appears when 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 This nozzle give a signal 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.930
 says that the crankshaft sensor us 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 works fine 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.430
 candles turned out to be cheese and this is understandable growth 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 bags open 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 there is no spark then there is no ignition and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 so sechki Sergei got to the brain 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.940
 checked them means the health of the circuit here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.420
 By the way, two wires are controllers. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.610
 minus here they are extremely we get 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.070
 this is one channel this is second maybe 1 4 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's 2 3 that's exactly the same color 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 we have wires here on the connector 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.729
 but this I tell you suddenly you decide 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.400
 check 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.220
 removed the brains dismantled means right from 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.939
 keys rang all wiring wiring 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 OK, so it turns out glitchy brains 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.060
 but somehow they are strange if already 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.799
 burned there burned down but here it turns out 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 now hooked back are starting 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.680
 check the signal again is what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 the reason maybe the generator gives interference 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.470
 such that brains are perceived as false 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.549
 signal and stop working can be 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.770
 from generator 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.700
 Well, what I want to show started 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 turns out the candles that's what it is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.979
 pseudo reno reno is a candle or not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.470
 incomprehensible well, somehow it’s not clear here 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.290
 these are the inscriptions 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.530
 flashlights are very why it shines 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.049
 not clear lettering here 's another candle well 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.490
 candle raw understandable here than on 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.130
 prison some kind of blyamba unclear what 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 she could have formed 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.700
 unclear so and here 's another candle her 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.069
 just hard rubbed like this 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 here 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.890
 nothing is about to be black like that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.310
 the bar you can see here it is a black bar 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.110
 nothing more than a spark that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.319
 it turns out we have the entire length of it 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.489
 about 3-4 centimeters pierces that is 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.510
 apparently there is nothing inside the candle itself 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.859
 a dummy of some kind called reno and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.569
 therefore , it’s rather easier to go from 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.099
 top 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:47.459
 here 's the cap food here yes 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.909
 literally gave nuts look it with us 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.530
 the third cylinder was looking at the wires 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:03:03.030
 inside there are some prints so this is not the one 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:05.970
 here we have 3 cylinder which was but 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.299
 here now here's right in the cap we are inside 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.739
 see such a longitudinal trace here it is clearly 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.959
 There such a burn arises well, most likely 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.590
 from the fact that here is such a discharge from the Crimea 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.310
 there was it creating interference and 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.409
 the controller simply refused to work 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.659
 so here in time, change the candles in 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.000
 time me these wires and most importantly 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:38.750
 if you change it you change already on 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.750
 the original part is all
