difficult<00:05:30.350> for<00:05:30.950> me<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:31.880> think<00:05:32.060> this<00:05:32.450> what

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
difficult for me so I think this what

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.190 
difficult for me so I think this what
the<00:05:33.590> game<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.430> bring<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.479> because<00:05:35.660> it

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
the game it bring it to you because it

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.909 
the game it bring it to you because it
is<00:05:36.710> no<00:05:37.280> different<00:05:37.790> momentum<00:05:38.710> awesome<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.860> mean

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
is no different momentum awesome I mean

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.300 
is no different momentum awesome I mean
again<00:05:40.820> just<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.390> idea<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:42.140> depending<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
again just that idea of depending on the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.760 
again just that idea of depending on the
situation<00:05:44.120> or<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.479> circumstance<00:05:45.260> the<00:05:45.560> fight

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
situation or the circumstance the fight

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.620 
situation or the circumstance the fight
oh<00:05:45.890> yeah<00:05:46.100> that<00:05:46.640> that's<00:05:46.880> what<00:05:47.180> makes<00:05:47.360> a

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
oh yeah that that's what makes a
