00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.640
 or health we are going to do a little and the 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.490
 new james dean japac a new dlc for 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.929
 the videos wait brings enough things 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.749
 interesting so good surely 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.849
 let's start by reviewing the weapons in 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.440
 this case if we have the level sour that 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.750
 it's a new sniper rifle for 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.030
 this game we already have with this would already be 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.900
 six snipers for our 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.360
 weapons collection 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.119
 so first of all what's more 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.789
 stand out in this weapon 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.530
 the statistics of the weapon is that we have 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.059
 a fairly high rate of fire 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.470
 quite superior to the rest of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.290
 sniper is a weapon 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.030
 semiautomatic and good at what that 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.620
 damage precision stability does not stand out 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.540
 with respect to other snipers 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.460
 but what is quite accessories 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 we have talk for example the langrero 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.760
 that will improve a bit the accuracy and 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.160
 we also have the big green booster 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 that in this case the first thing here is a 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.530
 cannon with silencer as to what 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.119
 grip we have here the leicester grip 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.339
 which in this case improves stability 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.129
 but it reduces the level of 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.440
 hiding is also the subtle the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.720
 unite that produces stability but 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.580
 helps to improve the level of concealment and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 finally the waldo grit that helps 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.350
 improve the stability level in two 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.540
 now in practice there is not much that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.979
 say actually stressed shooter has 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 a lot of a lot 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.439
 acceptable 50 bullets total a charger 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 10 but without a doubt what stands out most this 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.960
 weapon is that it has a good cadence of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.909
 fire which makes it useful for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 annihilate several chain enemies 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.189
 nothing so good here we have the new 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 cross vertex that is based on the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.539
 famous his rifle vector which is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.320
 known for having appeared in many 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.759
 shooter games and so on so good 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.080
 this is a possible lunge basically 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.330
 because it has a rate of fire 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.310
 pretty good so let's see here 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.409
 Weapon statistics to see charger 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 of 30 bullets we have a total ammunition 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.020
 of 120 the clear fire rate that is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 integrate higher that exist for your 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.179
 possible 1200 the damage was within 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.039
 normal but the precision let's say 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.780
 that is his skinniest point 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.000
 to see in terms of modifications we have 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.890
 two new verbal accuracy that is 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.349
 to improve the level of damage and they had 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.079
 a little bit of precision and we have the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.220
 business professor called hps suppressor his 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.200
 initiator obviously 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 is all that this weapon brings but it is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 can make other modifications that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.730
 they came in earlier than the is so 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.500
 no problem 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.440
 the freight because of the short 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.970
 distance due to pressure is better 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.810
 use it from the hip as they can 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.129
 see here is pretty good but let's go 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.040
 to continue testing the to give a better 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.379
 verdict 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.090
 to give we also have a new weapon 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.939
 secondary in this case is the gun 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.590
 quads bout a kind of crossbow very 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.500
 good for stealth as well as for 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.109
 quite versatile combat 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 there is ok to see statistics the 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:07.590
 Arman demos ammo only one but it's 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.790
 able to store up to 25 dates on 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 damage is to say that it is pretty good 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.060
 as well as the precision and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.189
 stability and also at the level of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.500
 concealment that we can say can be improved 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.480
 in order to use the function and with 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.220
 which is required stricter 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.020
 stealth 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.570
 where are we going to see the accessories that 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.880
 bring this weapon, we have the script here 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.910
 volts that is a kind of dart or 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.190
 explosive arrow this date is once 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.890
 thrown is destroyed by the explosion 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.000
 so it can not be reused 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.980
 which does not happen with the normal date 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.040
 just as it does not happen with the next 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.770
 which is the poisoned arrow which 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.350
 have a chance to be able to use 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.320
 the enemies but this may vary 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.730
 depending on the enemy this varies from a 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.590
 enemy to another so not all 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.940
 enemies are going to answer for the same 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.830
 way to poison ok to see we have here in 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.360
 cannon we have clean coal that helps 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.090
 to improve concealment as well as 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.340
 the ska lethal link that basically meets 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.380
 the same function as the previous one now 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.690
 in controllers we have the gay field that 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.250
 helps to also improve the concealment and 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.600
 finally which destroy that the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.120
 You really do not know what it's for but 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.010
 here it says that it reduces the concealment in 1 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.660
 to see how different star band can 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.030
 use three types of ammunition 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.639
 different normal normal date 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.130
 explosive and the poisoned arrow in this 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.810
 case we see that the normal arrows or 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.540
 poisoned can also be recovered 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.120
 of the dead enemies 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.950
 so to 19 another is also included 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.050
 type of poisoned arrow only that in 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.520
 this case is for the arch this beach 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.540
 It is available for all inclusive 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.840
 for those who have not acquired 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.210
 this dlc so you know it's free 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.820
 and here we have the new throwing weapon 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.250
 for this game is the famous shuriken or 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.990
 ninja star and good is fucking 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.000
 mother because you can use it to 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.389
 different times since these 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.190
 stars are also poisoned 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.990
 We have a total of 10 stars 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.840
 which when we throw them we can go back to 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.910
 recover the rest of that stealth the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.970
 effect is instantaneous 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.560
 in combat it will also depend on the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.630
 force of the enemies in this case to 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.380
 normal children transmitted too 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.810
 instantly in the case of soldiers 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.970
 we see how the effect took a little longer 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.120
 but finally the enemy succumbs to 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.890
 the poison where if the present is about 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.990
 all when bloggers since we can 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.270
 throw in the star and that way and 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.490
 train them to help and stay 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.860
 above 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.810
 so he's a motherfucker in the case of 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.780
 the pacers the damage is much but without 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.479
 It also helps a little to incapacitate 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.120
 momentarily to be able to finish the 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.830
 with more tranquility 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.800
 they knew how much powerful enemies 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.860
 for example the bulldozers the effect is 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.600
 practically nil so I do not recommend 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.090
 the salt stars to strike just because 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.620
 the part that you waste is also 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.820
 probable of what 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.820
 make them bite the dust 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.780
 the new blow of kata and its blows 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.130
 Caracas with different different types 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.289
 sequences of hits that can be 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.270
 use in combat 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.309
 so he is fucking mother above all 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.919
 to shoot down enemies since it has a 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:22.659
 good power from above and unbalance 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.539
 put sound effects as well as a 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.999
 kind of shouts of karate but good to 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.339
 see next weapon we see in okinawa side 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.259
 which is a kind of the oriental the 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.930
 which has a pretty load time 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:38.020
 good although it does not have so much concealment 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.490
 like the previous one but it's still pretty 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.009
 effective above all to finish 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.059
 quickly with the enemies and 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.399
 stabbed 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:47.800
 we also have the claw that good in 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:50.619
 this case has a moderate damage it 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.940
 you can use basically to grab 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.890
 the enemy grabs these 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.860
 so as you can see it's good because 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:01.490
 has a good sequence of blows like that 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.490
 that this time 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.340
 finally we have a kind of 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.199
 poisoned knife but unlike 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.319
 the ninja stars this here is not 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.330
 can throw as well as the chance 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:17.090
 of being able to incapacitate enemies with the 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.449
 poison will also vary from an enemy 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:23.009
 to another so you already know try not to 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.020
 fail the knife 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.469
 and as always we also have more faces 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.050
 new as well as patterns of 

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:33.029
 huelva that they always bring Bordeaux and 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.830
 they matter so I hope that I have 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:39.349
 liked this little review and we 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.349
 we will see then until a next video
