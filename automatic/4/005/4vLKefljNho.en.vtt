00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.190 

you<00:03:53.640> know<00:03:53.790> actually<00:03:54.150> I'm<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.690> going<00:03:55.020> to<00:03:55.080> let

you know actually I'm just going to let

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200 
you know actually I'm just going to let
you<00:03:55.320> imagine<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.910> because<00:03:56.910> it's<00:03:57.090> really

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
you imagine this because it's really

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.140 
you imagine this because it's really
hard<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.570> do<00:03:57.720> oh<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.730> smells<00:03:59.730> like<00:03:59.910> rubber

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
hard to do oh it's smells like rubber

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.960 
hard to do oh it's smells like rubber
cement<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.340> cooling<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.520> my<00:04:02.670> fingers

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
cement and it's cooling on my fingers

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.270 
cement and it's cooling on my fingers
now<00:04:03.120> rubber<00:04:03.420> cement<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.140> lot<00:04:04.380> cheaper<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
now rubber cement is a lot cheaper I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.720 
now rubber cement is a lot cheaper I
think<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:06.090> shoe<00:04:06.360> goo<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.870> really<00:04:07.410> thick<00:04:07.770> see

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
think this shoe goo is really thick see

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.410 
think this shoe goo is really thick see
it<00:04:09.200> barely<00:04:10.200> go<00:04:10.830> over<00:04:11.190> there<00:04:11.520> see<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.150> little

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
bump anyway I don't know what's the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.240 
bump anyway I don't know what's the
difference<00:04:16.260> between<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.130> rubber

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
difference between this and rubber

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.890 
difference between this and rubber
cement<00:04:17.520> rubber<00:04:18.090> cement<00:04:18.270> is<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> lot<00:04:18.690> cheaper

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
cement rubber cement is a lot cheaper

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.460 
cement rubber cement is a lot cheaper
though<00:04:19.140> that's<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.590> difference<00:04:20.030> okay<00:04:21.030> Tata

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
though that's one difference okay Tata

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.540 
though that's one difference okay Tata
actually<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.620> comes<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.130> pointed

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
actually this comes in a pointed

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.220 
actually this comes in a pointed
container<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.660> direct<00:04:25.050> this

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
container so you can just direct this

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.190 
container so you can just direct this
stuff<00:04:25.580> rubber<00:04:26.580> cement<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.180> have<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.570> paint<00:04:28.050> it
