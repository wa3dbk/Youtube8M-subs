 manufactured mass merchandise in March dead 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.119

 that it does not seem so easy Thomas Freitag knows what I'm talking about 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.230
 an artist who threatens to introduce Tomas knows she knows that she too is 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.409
 Glassblowers are talking 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.839
 and successfully asserts itself for ten years the routinierten mass commodity in 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.839
 the department stores

 Rena Borgert is the last glassblower in the region 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.580
 earlier Klopp there dozens of factories here but the technical

 Progress has not done any harm to them all 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.640
 but actually 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.420
 she once learned technical glass instrument construction 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.270
 but now 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
 she has devoted herself fully to art 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.480
 from the c-kader a small Bayer cup with chicken feet 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.070
 graceful and playful but still suitable for everyday use 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 absolutely dishwasher safe 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 van Gaal The material glass is primarily transparency 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.160
 that means by slim man who can sing so beautiful in the flowering 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.480
 Translucence reflection 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.420
 yes, that one can let his creativity run free 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.230
 Percent shaping and free 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 that would be fun with trucks 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.040
 Florian Seidel 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.380
 even on the day 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.380
 if that from the net 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.719
 thus, the starting material 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.429
 a glass door 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.849
 nobody knows that fully occupied as a man of the middle for the reform 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.159
 Glass is physically a liquid at room temperature 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.599
 petrified 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.819
 The art is not telling them to drop, however, it's on the plantation 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 and then approach each other 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.949
 Years are 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.489
 Experience that one one 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.840
 the glass gets exactly there like the pattern if one says that also 8 years 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 dominates the glass and after 8 years 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 Emperor Anna clear 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.180
 carefully 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.680

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 Finally, benefit very gently 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.730
 the elegant momentum throws her foot on the last step in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.139
 the oxygen flame loses the artwork's inner tension 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 the color red the book Euro costs first open 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.789
 Thousands have 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.839
 All day long, Irene has been cautious in her manufactory alone 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.199
 In the afternoon, the first customers come for their birthday 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 I would like to have a lectern

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.549
 come to your 30th with really urgent emergencies 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.669
 Dr 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.009
 to be left 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.059
 only now 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.589
 yes that is not a problem Well luck and glass maybe that breaks 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.549
 but this time he can still prevent them 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.479
