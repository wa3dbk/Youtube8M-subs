00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.390
 Faint 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.759
 In search of course that Nishii Satoshi does not advance 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.329
 I will help you for a moment 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.329
 Aomori in the Tohoku region of Japan 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 Physical fitness training 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.449
 Yes, but I did not use it together 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.999
 Other than this, it is said that it is a bit of being founded, but pets 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.130
 Founding and writing only skin is a good thing to write people 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.070
 After all I like your opinion 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.990
 Transition to Hokusai 72 years 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.850
 If you are 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 Korean 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.329
 High 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.470
 An illustration has been sent from Seiko 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.450
 That 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.570
 Kochi degree 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.050
 I want to rewrite 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 Has the talent to stop at 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.140
 For example, it is easier for foreigners to get 103,000, so various ideas 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.940
 It is fun if there is 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.850
 It is fun to see 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570
 Rewriting Kochi-style 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.100
 I would like to have a great play, but I enjoyed it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.340
 I will not take you where the influence of Japan goes on 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.360
 It is also the second one that is being sent 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.300
 It is too late 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.510
 There are people 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.700
 It is a heavy curve 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.820
 That's surprising 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 Because I want to make an underground 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.260
 After all we are planning 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.660
 21 shook his head 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.300
 Not from the stratum 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 In other words, the regulations are strengthened 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.720
 I want to live on the sea floor 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.230
 It is the eye 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.260
 difficult 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.900
 It is high, but after all I write for self-satisfaction 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.820
 I want to go to the bathroom 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.790
 I will be satisfied 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.220
 Still it feels like one bird and two birds because it is my satisfaction 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.160
 Is it built that you wanted to become a idiot? 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.680
 I love to transport by air since I was a child 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.180
 If you want to gradually shape it while doing pex. 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.739
 Price lowered 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.409
 I live in Japan when I can go down the atomic bomb 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.369
 Shine 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:18.499
 Because Captain Sato has a bit of the Three Kingdoms at this time 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.359
 I can not talk 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.619
 think 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.859
 You are writing a character 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.159
 Come on food 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 Seems to be extensive 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.329
 I have my favorite food 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.569
 It is fried chicken if it says 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.019
 I announced before the close 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.579
 As soon as I get into the backstage, Maldini is strong, and Mardini reports 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.049
 Course Thank you
