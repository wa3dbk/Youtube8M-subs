00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.430
Spring is a great season in New York because
you're sort of coming out of the winter and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.180
all the black and the cold and the miserable
weather and, you know, the sun's out.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.070
And you finally have the chance to wear these
clothes that have maybe been hiding in the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.230
back of your closet.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.320
You know, you're sick of all the dark colors
and you want to wear the brights.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.590
So there's so many chances to really make
a statement with what you're wearing.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.830
There's that famous scene in The Devil Wears
Prada.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.410
Florals for spring, you know.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410
It's true, though.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
You can wear florals.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.410
Wear them in the spring time.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.140
It's, all the flowers are coming up.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.610
You want to feel bright.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.950
It's a great way to pair, you know, a floral
dress with a jean jacket.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.400
I think a jean jacket is probably a spring
staple.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.120
You can use it to wear sort of some of your
winter clothes but sort of transition out

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.620
of the cold weather.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.210
So maybe your jeans, like a dark jean with
some boots and a light jean jacket.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700
You are allowed to mix denims provided they
don't match.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.580
You can wear black jeans and a light blue
jacket.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.940
Or even like a grey denim jacket with some
dark blue jeans.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.390
All you want to do is make sure that they
don't look like they're a matching pair.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.780
Crop blazers are another option.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.490
Any sort of scarves.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.700
You're gonna be hitting probably a fair amount
of rain so this where you can bring out your

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.240
rain boots and sort of style them with your
spring clothes.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.490
Wear them with flirty dresses and shorts and
little tank tops and blazers and cardigans.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.659
And it's all about just dressing in a way
that makes you feel sort of airy and breezy

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.549
and gives you lots of layers in case it rains
or in case it gets extra hot.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.399
You know there's always that one really, really
sunny day in April and everybody thinks summer's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.780
here and then it shows up two months later.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.670
This is the chance where you can sort of play
around with your style.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.539
And you can also test out things for summer.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.979
Maybe there's certain things that you think
you want to try, trends you saw.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.190
Start cycling a few of them into your outfits
in the spring in a way that, you know, maybe

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.350
it's a super daring blouse and a bright, bright
print.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.140
But you can throw a blazer over it.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.049
And then by the time summer rolls around maybe
you'll feel comfortable just wearing that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.839
print on its own.
