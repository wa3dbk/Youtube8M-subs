00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.290 
little bit of crunch so what I have done
is<00:04:17.020> just<00:04:17.050> made<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.530> into<00:04:17.710> a<00:04:17.830> paste<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.120> let's

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
is just made this into a paste so let's

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.240 
is just made this into a paste so let's
allow<00:04:19.570> this<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.900> come<00:04:20.110> to<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> nice<00:04:20.500> boil<00:04:20.890> what

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
allow this to come to a nice boil what

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.460 
allow this to come to a nice boil what
we<00:04:21.400> want<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.670> do<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.000> we<00:04:22.690> have<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.870> ensure<00:04:23.080> that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
we want to do is we have to ensure that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.120 
we want to do is we have to ensure that
the<00:04:23.650> raw<00:04:24.030> smell<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.210> tamarind<00:04:25.660> goes<00:04:26.650> away<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the raw smell of tamarind goes away and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.070 
the raw smell of tamarind goes away and
then<00:04:27.790> we<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.180> adding<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.660> rest<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.960> the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
then we will be adding the rest of the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.100 
then we will be adding the rest of the
ingredients<00:04:30.270> let's<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.510> look<00:04:31.720> at<00:04:31.840> how<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
ingredients let's have a look at how the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.630 
ingredients let's have a look at how the
gravy<00:04:32.920> is<00:04:32.950> doing<00:04:33.400> as<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.420> see<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
gravy is doing as you can see that the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.700 
gravy is doing as you can see that the
tamarind<00:04:36.640> has<00:04:36.930> evaporated<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.380> water<00:04:38.560> is

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
tamarind has evaporated the water is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.210 
tamarind has evaporated the water is
evaporated<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:40.120> reduced<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.590> now<00:04:41.800> at<00:04:42.160> this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
evaporated it's reduced so now at this

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.820 
evaporated it's reduced so now at this
stage<00:04:42.580> what<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.880> will<00:04:42.970> do<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.420> reserved

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
stage what I will do is the reserved

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.270 
stage what I will do is the reserved
liquid<00:04:44.830> goes<00:04:45.370> in

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
liquid goes in

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.910 
liquid goes in
I'll<00:04:47.670> add<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.180> little<00:04:48.300> bit<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:49.760> water

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.290 

and<00:04:54.300> now<00:04:55.300> I'm<00:04:55.540> going<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.840> add<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.230> paste<00:04:57.300> that

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
and now I'm going to add this paste that

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.050 
and now I'm going to add this paste that
I<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.720> made<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.940> can<00:05:01.120> see<00:05:01.300> nice<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.840> thick

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
I have made you can see nice and thick

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.420 
I have made you can see nice and thick
because<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.210> two<00:05:04.390> ingredients<00:05:05.140> one<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.560> the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
because of two ingredients one is the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.340 
because of two ingredients one is the
good<00:05:06.670> quantity<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.360> coconut<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.870> has<00:05:08.110> been

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
good quantity of coconut that has been

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.000 
good quantity of coconut that has been
used<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:12.310> rice<00:05:13.410> now<00:05:14.410> what<00:05:14.620> is<00:05:14.740> going<00:05:14.950> to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
used and the rice now what is going to

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.410 
used and the rice now what is going to
happen<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:15.910> going<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.180> thicken

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
happen is this is going to thicken

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.580 
happen is this is going to thicken
further<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:18.520> use<00:05:19.450> your<00:05:19.480> judgment<00:05:20.110> what<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.410> am

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
further so use your judgment what I am

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.760 
further so use your judgment what I am
going<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.890> do<00:05:21.010> is<00:05:21.040> go<00:05:21.550> ahead<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:22.090> bit<00:05:22.380> water

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.020 

so<00:05:26.770> what<00:05:27.010> we<00:05:27.130> are<00:05:27.160> going<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.430> do<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.580> we<00:05:27.970> will

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
so what we are going to do is we will

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.090 
so what we are going to do is we will
give<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.570> mix<00:05:28.600> will<00:05:29.350> allow<00:05:29.680> this<00:05:29.920> to

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
give this a mix will allow this to

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.420 
give this a mix will allow this to
simmer<00:05:30.370> let's<00:05:31.620> have<00:05:32.620> a<00:05:32.650> look<00:05:32.950> at<00:05:33.070> her<00:05:33.160> gravy

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430
