00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.199> how<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.620> use<00:00:01.860> i<00:00:02.100> annotate<00:00:02.760> to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so this is how I use i annotate to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.930 
so this is how I use i annotate to
markup<00:00:03.959> PDF<00:00:04.440> articles<00:00:05.069> when<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.850> my

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
markup PDF articles when I'm for my

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.460 
markup PDF articles when I'm for my
research<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:06.509> first<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.960> all<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> start<00:00:07.350> by

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
research so first of all I start by

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.610 
research so first of all I start by
opening<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.069> annotate<00:00:08.580> application<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
opening the on annotate application as I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.280 
opening the on annotate application as I
mentioned<00:00:10.980> previously<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.480> workflow<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
mentioned previously in the workflow I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.939 
mentioned previously in the workflow I
store<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.370> my<00:00:14.639> documents<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.650> Dropbox<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
store all of my documents on Dropbox and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
store all of my documents on Dropbox and
that<00:00:17.430> directly<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.150> i<00:00:18.300> annotate<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.930> can

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that directly with i annotate so I can

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.950 
that directly with i annotate so I can
go<00:00:19.289> into<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.100> hit<00:00:20.189> library<00:00:20.960> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
go into here and I can hit library and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
go into here and I can hit library and
you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.500> across<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> top<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.580> we've

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
got the full list from the library I can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
want to take margin notes and this is
sort<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> big<00:01:35.820> trick<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.290> use

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sort of the big trick is I make it I use

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
sort of the big trick is I make it I use
my<00:01:37.860> fingers<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> pinch<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> thing

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
my fingers and I pinch to make the thing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
my fingers and I pinch to make the thing
really<00:01:39.509> wide<00:01:40.130> which<00:01:41.130> gives<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.729> more

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
really wide which gives me a lot more

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.810 
really wide which gives me a lot more
space<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> document<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.820> expanded

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
space so if the document is is expanded

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.179 
space so if the document is is expanded
and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> tool<00:01:46.680> or

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and then I can just hit the tool or

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.490 
and then I can just hit the tool or
making<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> note<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.350> my

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
making a note and I can then use my

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:02.300 
making a note and I can then use my
stylus<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.159> write<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.399> appropriate
