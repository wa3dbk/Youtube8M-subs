 the ultimate a brace you have the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.840
 competition done, yes, and it went 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.820
 you almost had the growth 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.479
 yes a bit but what is fine and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.479
 this became less and less 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 hey the day of the final how did you do 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.489

 go for competitions what a Muslim 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 and then we have a discussion 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.780
 and then it is again very quickly 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 time to have a good lunch again 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.190

 who won the hockey world league 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.030
 then he told you in advance 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.709
 always a peanut butter sandwich 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.700
 that succeeded practice that is through 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.400
 went 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.810
 yes we have the magic peanut butter jar name 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.819
 the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 that really became a thing yes i got it 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.510
 me willemijn bos are cooking pots too and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.109
 so she takes him every time 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.390
 actually from those people i have one 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.640
 foreign and the food it really is 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.049
 a peanut butter sandwich for every 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.609
 competition and he helped 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.739
 yes what i can do by it 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.349
 special all sheets no no yes so long 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.959
 Willem Bos and children play together 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.739
 then the like he good bed not whole though 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.940
 has seen 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.220
 meanwhile, those nice goals 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.739
 but the pole the first chicken had it all 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.599
 great to see the second year 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.609
 super but in it now also more 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.170
 because this is in your own country 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.730
 and because you are already like that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.160
 good that everyone thinks you are doing it 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.720
 well again yes yes so that very much 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.310
 press because everyone told you they will be 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.139
 just world champion with a form 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.880
 this is not how we deliver for a very long time 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.769
 have to do a lot of things and 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.049
 to leave ahead 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.169
 but yes i will be busy so already press but 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.430
 one as fine now so we exchange it 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.560
 was also our it wasn't us 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.150
 Said all we did see it 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.470
 go see if it is the first week 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.389
 we can also all say to us 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.470
 want to be world champion ready 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.720
 they probably have that pressure too 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.190
 raised myself yes my music too 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.840
 of course against australia that were you 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.000
 want to come across earlier 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.470
 when we were somewhat uncertain but now 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.230
 was now full of conviction in that 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.299
 finale is felt'm afraid if 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.349
 you enter the study competition that is 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.970
 more exciting 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.769
 no I actually had a lot in the tension 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.299
 manners and fish me with multiple me 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.099
 was just really convinced that is with 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.470
 of course you don't know for sure but me 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.510
 had so much faith in everyone because of that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.799
 stood around and just a whole team 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.889
 that I really that we just go here 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.030
 do yes i am not going for 15,000 men 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.540
 in our own country we are not going to do this 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.190
 to give away 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.680
 no of course not but good law 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.760
 big party afterwards okay yes ceglie 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.130
 this beautiful party 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.510
 we also have some images from to 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.840
 what time did it finally go through 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.840
 with you 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.350
 I could take a taxi a quarter past six and then 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.990
 However , there will also be an extra party 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.160
 clear in deliberation and what do you do 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.870
 then you stay with the whole club 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.330
 each other or are there people who have been there more often 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.670
 oh yeah it's just going in with them 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.500
 we are all first a pub and then 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.030
 another yes and then it's just 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.650
 when you do 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.720
 entrance slowly I go out there in a 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.280
 bit off yes but now it is so look 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.050
 I have quite a lot to your perquy 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.460
 television attention and everyone is 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.110
 working on it but name plays 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.610
 meanwhile that football world cup of course 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.040
 yet also a lot of attention goes to 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.140
 the players are busy with you 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.570

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.160
 that again it annoying or is that 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.200
 frustrating 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.730
 no yes i know it is and i think so 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.250
 I have received quite a lot of attention 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.560
 for the two k and i very natural 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.910

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.220

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.530
 Netherlands that football men with too 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.880

 everyone's turn 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.330
 nobody expected it indeed 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.570
 he last but then the homage when 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.420
 is that your golden jagersma I have it 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.640

 the day to add a drama that mention 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.600
 but means something different to 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.210
 for is my true wednesday museum square 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.950

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.410
 and then only the competition or from 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.150

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.530
