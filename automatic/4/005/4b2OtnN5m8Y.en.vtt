00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.319 
take five and now if you look there's a
little<00:01:54.799> parenthesis<00:01:55.429> with<00:01:55.639> the<00:01:55.729> silencer<00:01:56.209> on

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
little parenthesis with the silencer on

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.899 
little parenthesis with the silencer on
there<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.689> it's<00:01:56.929> 42<00:01:57.529> which<00:01:57.770> means<00:01:57.979> silencer

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
there and it's 42 which means silencer

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.620 
there and it's 42 which means silencer
only<00:01:59.270> lowers<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.719> damage<00:02:00.079> um<00:02:00.340> from<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.630> far

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
only lowers the damage um from a far

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.539 
only lowers the damage um from a far
distance<00:02:03.079> that<00:02:03.259> does<00:02:03.409> not<00:02:03.529> change<00:02:03.889> the<00:02:04.130> damage

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
distance that does not change the damage

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.800 
distance that does not change the damage
at<00:02:04.759> point-blank<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.729> now<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:08.270> may<00:02:08.479> still

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
at point-blank and now that may still

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.540 
at point-blank and now that may still
means<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.140> at<00:02:09.410> Point<00:02:09.679> Blank<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:10.130> should<00:02:10.340> deal

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
means that at Point Blank is should deal

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.000 
means that at Point Blank is should deal
three<00:02:11.000> or<00:02:11.209> four<00:02:11.540> shots<00:02:11.810> depending<00:02:12.770> on<00:02:12.860> where

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
three or four shots depending on where

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.500 
three or four shots depending on where
you<00:02:13.099> hit<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> body<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.910> multiplier

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you hit on the body and the multiplier

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.250 
you hit on the body and the multiplier
from<00:02:15.349> close<00:02:15.709> range<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.400> from<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.880> distance<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
from close range and from a distance the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260 
from close range and from a distance the
a<00:02:18.650> far<00:02:19.190> distance<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.820> should<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.120> about<00:02:20.450> six

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
a far distance it should be about six

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.330 
a far distance it should be about six
shots<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.020> one<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.410> bullets<00:02:22.980> more

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
shots which is one or two bullets more

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.370 
shots which is one or two bullets more
than<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.210> did<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.510> have<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> silencer<00:02:25.080> off

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
than if you did not have a silencer off

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.290 
than if you did not have a silencer off
and<00:02:25.620> that's<00:02:25.770> why<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> silencer<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.880> gun<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
and that's why a silencer on this gun is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.600 
and that's why a silencer on this gun is
not<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.900> bad<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.830> getting<00:02:29.100> those<00:02:29.310> shots

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
not that bad because getting those shots

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.130 
not that bad because getting those shots
off<00:02:29.820> especially<00:02:30.030> having<00:02:30.450> focus<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.020> they're

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
off especially having focus if they're

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.540 
off especially having focus if they're
shooting<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.740> not<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.400> very

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
shooting you it's not going to be very

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.490 
shooting you it's not going to be very
hard

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
size I believe with extended mags it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.620 
size I believe with extended mags it
raises<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.480> by<00:02:55.200> 150%<00:02:56.130> which<00:02:56.610> means<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.120> 45

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
raises it by 150% which means we have 45

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.860 
raises it by 150% which means we have 45
and<00:02:57.900> our<00:02:57.990> extended<00:02:58.230> mags<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> fire<00:03:00.420> rate<00:03:00.690> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and our extended mags the fire rate is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.250 
and our extended mags the fire rate is
780<00:03:01.830> rpms<00:03:02.490> which<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.810> believe<00:03:03.960> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
780 rpms which is the I believe the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860 
780 rpms which is the I believe the
third<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.860> second<00:03:05.430> fastest<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.510> assault

third or second fastest of the assault

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.510 
third or second fastest of the assault
rifles<00:03:07.260> which<00:03:07.500> means<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.070> gun<00:03:08.250> puts

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
rifles which means that this gun puts

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.000 
rifles which means that this gun puts
out<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.030> bullets<00:03:09.300> pretty<00:03:09.960> fast<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
out a lot of bullets pretty fast and it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.560 
out a lot of bullets pretty fast and it
means<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.700> get<00:03:11.880> your<00:03:12.030> bullets<00:03:12.390> down
