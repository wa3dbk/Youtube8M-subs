00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.220 

today<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.829> will<00:00:02.010> be<00:00:02.129> talking<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:02.639> prime

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
today we will be talking about prime

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.380 
today we will be talking about prime
factorization<00:00:04.230> using<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.799> latter<00:00:05.040> method

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
factorization using the latter method

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.169 
factorization using the latter method
with<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.629> method<00:00:07.170> we<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.580> division

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
with this method we use a division

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.660 
with this method we use a division
process<00:00:09.870> but<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.380> divide<00:00:10.889> by<00:00:11.280> prime<00:00:11.639> numbers

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
process but we divide by prime numbers

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.930 
process but we divide by prime numbers
so<00:00:12.420> first<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.559> must<00:00:13.799> remember<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:14.519> our<00:00:14.549> prime

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so first we must remember what our prime

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
so first we must remember what our prime
numbers<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> top<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.619> our<00:00:16.710> page<00:00:17.010> we

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
numbers are so on the top of our page we

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
numbers are so on the top of our page we
will<00:00:17.520> write<00:00:17.730> 2<00:00:18.710> 3<00:00:20.150> 5<00:00:21.740> 7<00:00:22.740> 11<00:00:23.750> 13<00:00:26.570> etc<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.439> should

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
will write 2 3 5 7 11 13 etc that should

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.529 
will write 2 3 5 7 11 13 etc that should
be<00:00:28.890> sufficient<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.029> need

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
be sufficient for what we need

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530 
be sufficient for what we need
the<00:00:31.529> first<00:00:31.859> number<00:00:32.309> we're<00:00:32.520> looking<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the first number we're looking at is the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.100 
the first number we're looking at is the
number<00:00:33.690> 12<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.489> need<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> decide<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.660> we

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
number 12 and we need to decide if we

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.100 
number 12 and we need to decide if we
can<00:00:37.140> divide<00:00:37.920> by<00:00:38.640> 2<00:00:40.040> does<00:00:41.040> 12<00:00:41.700> divided<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:42.930> my

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
can divide by 2 does 12 divided by my

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
can divide by 2 does 12 divided by my
first<00:00:43.379> prime<00:00:43.860> number<00:00:43.890> 2<00:00:44.520> yes<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.450> does

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
will be out here and remember we were

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
will be out here and remember we were
talking<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.869> prime<00:01:43.520> factorizations<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
talking about prime factorizations and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.649 
talking about prime factorizations and
factors<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.979> multiplications<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.149> answer

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
factors are multiplications so my answer

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
factors are multiplications so my answer
is<00:01:48.689> 2<00:01:49.549> times<00:01:50.549> 2<00:01:51.000> times<00:01:51.450> 3<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
is 2 times 2 times 3 and if you want to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230 
is 2 times 2 times 3 and if you want to
check<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.630> problem<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.950> multiply<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> 2

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
check that problem we can multiply it 2

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.990 
check that problem we can multiply it 2
times<00:01:58.200> 2<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.530> 4<00:01:58.740> 4<00:02:00.049> times<00:02:01.049> 3<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> 12<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
times 2 is 4 4 times 3 is 12 and that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.679 
times 2 is 4 4 times 3 is 12 and that
was<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> number<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.840> began<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.490> 2<00:02:05.549> times<00:02:06.540> 2

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
was the number I began with so 2 times 2

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.520 
was the number I began with so 2 times 2
times<00:02:07.469> 3<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.610> prime<00:02:09.050> factorization<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.229> 12

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
times 3 is the prime factorization of 12

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.410 
times 3 is the prime factorization of 12
let's<00:02:12.530> try<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:12.800> again<00:02:13.010> let's<00:02:14.000> look<00:02:14.209> at<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
let's try that again let's look at the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.680 
let's try that again let's look at the
number<00:02:14.920> 70<00:02:17.049> does<00:02:18.049> 70<00:02:18.830> divided<00:02:19.819> by<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> first

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
number 70 does 70 divided by the first

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:30.640 
number 70 does 70 divided by the first
prime<00:02:21.230> number<00:02:22.030> two<00:02:26.080> well<00:02:27.080> yes<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.799> does<00:02:29.650> but

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
prime number two well yes it does but

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
prime number two well yes it does but
I'm<00:02:31.370> not<00:02:31.580> sure<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.849> remember<00:02:32.510> how<00:02:32.690> many<00:02:32.900> times

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
I'm not sure I remember how many times

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.640 
I'm not sure I remember how many times
so<00:02:33.650> let's<00:02:33.860> go<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.310> side<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.910> work<00:02:35.840> out<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
so let's go to the side and work out the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.970 
so let's go to the side and work out the
division<00:02:38.799> 70<00:02:39.799> divided<00:02:40.459> by<00:02:40.610> 2<00:02:41.110> does<00:02:42.110> 7<00:02:42.650> divided

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
division 70 divided by 2 does 7 divided

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.949 
division 70 divided by 2 does 7 divided
by<00:02:43.010> 2<00:02:43.480> 3<00:02:44.480> times<00:02:45.160> 3<00:02:46.160> times<00:02:46.430> 2<00:02:46.819> is<00:02:46.849> 6<00:02:48.970> 7<00:02:49.970> minus<00:02:50.390> 6<00:02:50.690> is

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
by 2 3 times 3 times 2 is 6 7 minus 6 is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.729 
by 2 3 times 3 times 2 is 6 7 minus 6 is
1<00:02:52.209> bring<00:02:53.209> down<00:02:53.420> my<00:02:53.720> 0<00:02:54.549> 10<00:02:55.549> divided<00:02:56.120> by<00:02:56.150> 2<00:02:56.359> is<00:02:56.989> 5

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
1 bring down my 0 10 divided by 2 is 5

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:05.520 
1 bring down my 0 10 divided by 2 is 5
and<00:02:58.629> 5<00:02:59.629> times<00:03:00.290> 2<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.950> 10<00:03:02.410> subtract<00:03:03.700> remainder<00:03:04.700> 0

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
and 5 times 2 is 10 subtract remainder 0

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.369 
and 5 times 2 is 10 subtract remainder 0
so<00:03:06.530> 70<00:03:07.340> divided<00:03:08.239> by<00:03:08.359> 2<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.989> 35<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:12.019> look<00:03:12.260> at

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
so 70 divided by 2 is 35 and I look at

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.220 
so 70 divided by 2 is 35 and I look at
that<00:03:12.530> process<00:03:12.859> again<00:03:13.489> does<00:03:14.349> 35<00:03:15.370> divided<00:03:16.370> by<00:03:16.639> 2

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
that process again does 35 divided by 2

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.150 
that process again does 35 divided by 2
well<00:03:18.230> since<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.829> ends<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.310> 5<00:03:19.340> no<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.389> does<00:03:20.569> not

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
well since it ends in a 5 no it does not

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.789 
well since it ends in a 5 no it does not
so<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.190> move<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:22.849> my<00:03:22.940> next<00:03:23.000> prime<00:03:23.660> number<00:03:23.799> does

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
so I move to my next prime number does

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.479 
so I move to my next prime number does
35<00:03:25.609> divided<00:03:26.540> by<00:03:26.569> 3<00:03:28.000> three<00:03:29.000> plus<00:03:29.510> five<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.900> eight

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
35 divided by 3 three plus five is eight

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.479 
35 divided by 3 three plus five is eight
but<00:03:31.489> 8<00:03:31.730> does<00:03:32.150> not<00:03:32.180> divide<00:03:32.389> by<00:03:33.049> three<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.799> no<00:03:34.099> I

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
but 8 does not divide by three so no I

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.800 
but 8 does not divide by three so no I
cannot<00:03:34.819> divide<00:03:35.569> 35<00:03:36.109> by<00:03:36.650> three<00:03:37.299> let's<00:03:38.299> move<00:03:38.599> to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
cannot divide 35 by three let's move to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.089 
cannot divide 35 by three let's move to
the<00:03:38.900> next<00:03:38.930> prime<00:03:39.440> number<00:03:39.470> 5<00:03:40.690> does<00:03:41.690> 35<00:03:42.440> divided

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
the next prime number 5 does 35 divided

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.990 
the next prime number 5 does 35 divided
by<00:03:43.130> 5<00:03:43.989> yes<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.200> does<00:03:45.410> since<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:46.250> ends<00:03:46.579> in<00:03:46.669> a<00:03:46.760> 5<00:03:47.590> 35

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
by 5 yes it does since it ends in a 5 35

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.240 
by 5 yes it does since it ends in a 5 35
divided<00:03:50.000> by<00:03:50.030> 5<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:51.459> 7<00:03:53.230> does<00:03:55.569> 7/5<00:03:56.569> no<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.889> I<00:03:57.919> move

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
divided by 5 is 7 does 7/5 no so I move

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.319 
divided by 5 is 7 does 7/5 no so I move
to<00:03:58.459> my<00:03:58.489> next<00:03:58.879> prime<00:03:59.269> number<00:03:59.889> does<00:04:00.889> 7<00:04:01.519> divided

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
to my next prime number does 7 divided

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.360 
to my next prime number does 7 divided
by<00:04:02.359> 7

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
by 7

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.629 
by 7
yes<00:04:05.200> 7<00:04:06.200> divided<00:04:06.889> by<00:04:06.919> 7<00:04:07.099> is<00:04:07.790> 1<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:09.310> I've<00:04:10.310> reached

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
yes 7 divided by 7 is 1 and I've reached

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.309 
yes 7 divided by 7 is 1 and I've reached
1<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:11.660> bottom<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:12.440> my<00:04:12.590> final<00:04:12.889> answer<00:04:13.280> is<00:04:13.549> 2

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
1 on the bottom so my final answer is 2

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.479 
1 on the bottom so my final answer is 2
times<00:04:15.319> 5<00:04:15.880> times<00:04:16.880> 7<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.859> want<00:04:19.099> to<00:04:19.159> check

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
times 5 times 7 and if I want to check

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.020 
times 5 times 7 and if I want to check
that<00:04:19.519> 2<00:04:20.450> times<00:04:20.840> 5<00:04:21.200> is<00:04:21.500> 10

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
that 2 times 5 is 10

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.250 
that 2 times 5 is 10
and<00:04:23.150> times<00:04:23.480> seven<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.260> 70
