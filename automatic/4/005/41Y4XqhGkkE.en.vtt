so the winds kicking up pretty good out

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.370 
so the winds kicking up pretty good out
of<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.480> south<00:03:25.720> right<00:03:26.020> now<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:27.960> my<00:03:28.960> explains

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
of the south right now and my explains

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.450 
of the south right now and my explains
why<00:03:29.560> we're<00:03:29.740> having<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.190> bit<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
why we're having a little bit of a

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.560 
why we're having a little bit of a
warm-up<00:03:30.880> but<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.870> still<00:03:32.050> chilly<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.700> put

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
warm-up but it's still chilly so I put

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.780 
warm-up but it's still chilly so I put
these<00:03:34.720> two<00:03:35.020> big<00:03:35.260> logs<00:03:35.590> right<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.250> as<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
these two big logs right here as a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.120 
these two big logs right here as a
windbreak<00:03:37.210> as<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.960> now<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.740> smoke

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
windbreak as you can see now the smoke

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.720 
windbreak as you can see now the smoke
is<00:03:39.340> rolling<00:03:40.300> right<00:03:40.540> up<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.870> sure<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.410> heat<00:03:41.590> is

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
is rolling right up and sure the heat is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.080 
is rolling right up and sure the heat is
small<00:03:42.730> pulling<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.240> smoke<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:44.760> it's<00:03:45.760> looking

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
small pulling the smoke so it's looking

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.180 
small pulling the smoke so it's looking
good<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.930> looks<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.560> fires<00:03:50.860> right
