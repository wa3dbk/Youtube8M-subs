saying kill streaks but anyway the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.359

bottom line is you know what I'm talking

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.600 
bottom line is you know what I'm talking
about<00:01:20.569> so<00:01:21.569> those<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> default<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> what

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
about so those are the default and what

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
about so those are the default and what
I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.880> suggest<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.720> once<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.680> unlock<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I would suggest is once you unlock the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
I would suggest is once you unlock the
care<00:01:26.490> package<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.270> swap<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
care package I would swap out the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
care package I would swap out the
quadrotor<00:01:28.680> drone<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> care<00:01:30.000> package<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
quadrotor drone for the care package for

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.330 
quadrotor drone for the care package for
a<00:01:30.540> couple<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> reasons<00:01:31.110> first<00:01:31.530> off<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a couple of reasons first off the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429 
a couple of reasons first off the
quadrotor<00:01:32.729> seems<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.299> pretty<00:01:33.509> easy<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.320> be

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
quadrotor seems to be pretty easy to be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.959 
quadrotor seems to be pretty easy to be
taken<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.610> even<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
taken down and you don't even have to

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.370 
taken down and you don't even have to
have<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> launcher<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> mean<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:36.930> literally

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have a launcher I mean I've literally

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
have a launcher I mean I've literally
shot<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.920> down<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:38.399> like<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> half<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.149> clip

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
shot one down with like a half of a clip

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.350 
shot one down with like a half of a clip
from<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:39.630> SMG<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.829> pretty<00:01:41.520> easy<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.090> get

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
from my SMG they're pretty easy to get

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
from my SMG they're pretty easy to get
rid<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.520> amount<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
rid of so and for the the amount of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149 
rid of so and for the the amount of
points<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.960> takes<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> just

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
points that it takes to get it just

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.709 
points that it takes to get it just
doesn't<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.579> seem<00:01:47.729> worth<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.360> you're

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
doesn't really seem worth it you're

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.999 
doesn't really seem worth it you're
better<00:01:48.930> off<00:01:49.079> running<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.469> care<00:01:49.649> package

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
better off running the care package

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.440 
better off running the care package
because<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> care<00:01:50.610> package<00:01:50.939> no<00:01:51.090> longer

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
because now the care package no longer

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.480 
because now the care package no longer
will<00:01:51.869> ever<00:01:52.079> drop<00:01:52.380> ammo<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.189> you're<00:01:53.340> never

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
will ever drop ammo so you're never

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.740 
will ever drop ammo so you're never
gonna<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:56.090> great<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.299> ammo<00:01:57.539> on

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
gonna get that like great I got ammo on

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.959 
gonna get that like great I got ammo on
my<00:01:57.869> care<00:01:58.079> package<00:01:58.110> feeling<00:01:58.909> you're<00:01:59.909> gonna

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
my care package feeling you're gonna

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.520 
my care package feeling you're gonna
you're<00:02:00.329> gonna<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.659> something<00:02:00.899> decent<00:02:01.170> like

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you're gonna get something decent like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
you're gonna get something decent like
at<00:02:01.649> least<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.009> UAV<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> counter<00:02:03.450> UAV<00:02:03.630> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
at least like a UAV or a counter UAV or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.929 
at least like a UAV or a counter UAV or
something<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.100> better<00:02:05.310> than<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> so

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
something much much better than that so

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
something much much better than that so
I<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.539> definitely<00:02:06.899> run<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.109> care<00:02:07.289> package

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I would definitely run the care package

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219 
I would definitely run the care package
over<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> quadrotor<00:02:08.640> drone<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.329> you<00:02:10.079> might

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
over the quadrotor drone and you might

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.330 
over the quadrotor drone and you might
end<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.410> getting<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.829> I<00:02:10.890> mean<00:02:11.100> I've<00:02:11.190> seen

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
end up getting like I mean I've seen

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.039 
end up getting like I mean I've seen
people<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.700> dogs<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.269> swarms<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> pisses

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
people get dogs and swarms and it pisses

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.030 
people get dogs and swarms and it pisses
me<00:02:13.200> off<00:02:13.320> because<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.739> were<00:02:13.829> on<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.950> other

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
me off because if they were on the other

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.069 
me off because if they were on the other
team<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.630> better<00:02:15.810> than<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
team but you know it's better than a

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.020 
team but you know it's better than a
fucking<00:02:16.620> quadrotor<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.459> easier<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> get

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
fucking quadrotor and it's easier to get

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.030 
fucking quadrotor and it's easier to get
because<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> streak<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.560> lower<00:02:19.799> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
because the streak is much lower to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.880 
because the streak is much lower to
piece<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.280> down<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.390> um<00:02:21.690> basically<00:02:22.470> that's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
piece it down so um basically that's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.199 
piece it down so um basically that's
what<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.070> would<00:02:23.250> suggest<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:23.910> once<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
what I would suggest and then once you

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.509 
what I would suggest and then once you
unlock<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.720> stealth<00:02:25.049> chopper<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.709> would<00:02:26.280> swap

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
unlock the stealth chopper I would swap

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.890 
unlock the stealth chopper I would swap
out<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> care<00:02:27.090> package<00:02:27.449> for<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.690> stealth

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
out the care package for the stealth

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.140 
out the care package for the stealth
chopper<00:02:28.169> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
chopper and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.330 
chopper and
the<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.989> stealth<00:02:30.200> chopper<00:02:30.379> in<00:02:30.680> my<00:02:30.860> mind<00:02:31.099> edge

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
the the stealth chopper in my mind edge

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.830 
the the stealth chopper in my mind edge
is<00:02:31.489> fucking<00:02:31.819> rapes<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.209> mean<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> haven't<00:02:32.659> really

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
is fucking rapes I mean I haven't really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.910 
is fucking rapes I mean I haven't really
seen<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.049> lot<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.260> people<00:02:33.379> shooting<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:33.890> down

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
seen a lot of people shooting it down

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.710 
seen a lot of people shooting it down
and<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.700> gets<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.060> gets<00:02:35.239> out<00:02:35.390> there<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.659> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
and it gets it gets out there and it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.140 
and it gets it gets out there and it
gets<00:02:35.810> some<00:02:36.080> kills<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
gets some kills it's not like the the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.140 
gets some kills it's not like the the
chopper<00:02:38.569> from<00:02:38.780> black<00:02:39.470> ops<00:02:39.709> 1<00:02:40.099> where<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
chopper from black ops 1 where it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970 
chopper from black ops 1 where it
literally<00:02:41.659> was<00:02:42.019> completely<00:02:42.590> fucking<00:02:42.950> useless

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
literally was completely fucking useless

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.309 
literally was completely fucking useless
most<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.909> time<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.599> one<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:44.989> comes

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
most of the time this one actually comes

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.229 
most of the time this one actually comes
out<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.620> does<00:02:45.799> work<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.610> basically<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.209> way

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
out and does work so basically the way

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.330 
out and does work so basically the way
that<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.599> is<00:02:47.780> set<00:02:47.959> up<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.040> said<00:02:49.190> I'm

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that this is set up I'm like I said I'm

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.089 
that this is set up I'm like I said I'm
running<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.819> UAV<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.290> lightning<00:02:51.739> strike

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
running the the UAV the lightning strike

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.210 
running the the UAV the lightning strike
and<00:02:52.310> then<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:54.349> stealth<00:02:54.620> chopper<00:02:54.890> and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then the the stealth chopper and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.039 
and then the the stealth chopper and
what<00:02:55.610> you're<00:02:55.730> gonna<00:02:55.849> see<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:56.239> there's<00:02:56.959> a

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
an objective based game type because of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.490 
an objective based game type because of
the<00:03:01.819> way<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.180> these<00:03:02.329> score<00:03:02.629> streaks<00:03:02.959> work<00:03:03.290> as

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the way that these score streaks work as

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
the way that these score streaks work as
you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:07.549> couple<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.060> kills<00:03:08.269> a

you get 50 points like say Kill
Confirmed<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.140> 50<00:03:21.409> points<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.769> kill<00:03:21.950> 100

Confirmed you get 50 points to kill 100
points<00:03:22.909> per<00:03:23.030> confirm<00:03:23.989> though<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.769> basically

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
points per confirm though so basically

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.420 
points per confirm though so basically
you<00:03:26.180> get<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:27.140> UAVs<00:03:27.530> three<00:03:27.799> hundred<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.159> fifty

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
you get the UAVs three hundred and fifty

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.410 
you get the UAVs three hundred and fifty
points<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.840> got<00:03:30.079> three<00:03:30.500> kills<00:03:30.859> and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
points so if you got three kills and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.240 
points so if you got three kills and
confirmed<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.690> tags<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.470> would<00:03:33.919> have<00:03:34.069> your

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
confirmed the tags you would have your

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.460 
confirmed the tags you would have your
UAV<00:03:34.579> no<00:03:35.450> problem<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:35.989> you'd<00:03:36.079> actually<00:03:36.139> have<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
UAV no problem and you'd actually have a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.990 
UAV no problem and you'd actually have a
little<00:03:36.620> bit<00:03:36.709> more<00:03:36.980> than<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.310> because<00:03:37.730> it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
little bit more than that because it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.190 
little bit more than that because it
breaks<00:03:38.209> down<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.540> one<00:03:38.630> hundred<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:38.959> fifty

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
breaks down to one hundred and fifty

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.520 
breaks down to one hundred and fifty
points<00:03:39.560> per<00:03:40.489> kill<00:03:40.819> plus<00:03:41.120> confirm<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.109> actually

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
points per kill plus confirm so actually

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.800 
points per kill plus confirm so actually
two<00:03:42.709> kills<00:03:42.980> two<00:03:43.220> confirms<00:03:43.700> then<00:03:44.269> maybe<00:03:44.569> like

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
two kills two confirms then maybe like

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
two kills two confirms then maybe like
you<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.079> couple<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.470> assists<00:03:46.010> one<00:03:46.549> more

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
you know a couple of assists one more

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.819 
you know a couple of assists one more
kill<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.930> running<00:03:48.260> around<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.739> just

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
kill just running around and just

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.740 
kill just running around and just
picking<00:03:49.160> up<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.340> random<00:03:49.730> stray<00:03:50.000> tag<00:03:50.269> floating

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
picking up a random stray tag floating

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.650 
picking up a random stray tag floating
around<00:03:50.840> next<00:03:51.260> thing<00:03:51.379> know<00:03:51.470> you've<00:03:51.620> got<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.829> UAV

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
around next thing know you've got a UAV

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.479 
around next thing know you've got a UAV
slightly<00:03:53.660> after<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:53.989> get<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.230> UAV<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:55.099> very

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
slightly after you get the UAV it's very

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.699 
slightly after you get the UAV it's very
easy<00:03:55.940> just<00:03:56.209> by<00:03:56.540> getting<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.930> couple<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.349> kills<00:03:57.530> a

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
easy just by getting a couple of kills a

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.229 
easy just by getting a couple of kills a
couple<00:03:57.949> of<00:03:58.010> confirms<00:03:58.400> whatever<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.970> get<00:03:59.120> to

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
couple of confirms whatever to get to

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.420 
couple of confirms whatever to get to
your<00:03:59.359> lightning<00:03:59.780> strike<00:04:00.139> once<00:04:01.099> you<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.310> your

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
your lightning strike once you get your

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.099 
your lightning strike once you get your
lightning<00:04:01.609> strike<00:04:02.060> you've<00:04:02.629> already<00:04:02.780> got<00:04:02.989> the

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
lightning strike you've already got the

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.900 
lightning strike you've already got the
UAV<00:04:03.470> up<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:03.799> you<00:04:03.889> kinda<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.280> pretty<00:04:04.579> much<00:04:04.730> know

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
UAV up so you kinda you pretty much know

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.879 
UAV up so you kinda you pretty much know
where<00:04:05.030> they're<00:04:05.180> spawning<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.620> way<00:04:06.739> that

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
where they're spawning and the way that

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:07.990 
where they're spawning and the way that
Ghost<00:04:07.069> works<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:07.519> unless<00:04:07.819> they're

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
Ghost works now unless they're

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.059 
Ghost works now unless they're
completely<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.750> non-stop<00:04:09.169> moving<00:04:09.919> you're

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
completely like non-stop moving you're

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.559 
completely like non-stop moving you're
gonna<00:04:10.160> see<00:04:10.430> where<00:04:10.579> they're<00:04:10.699> at<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.419> can

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
my next lightning strike and then my

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.510 
my next lightning strike and then my
next<00:04:45.930> lightning<00:04:46.440> strike<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.950> turn<00:04:47.160> into<00:04:47.430> my

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
next lightning strike can turn into my

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.030 
next lightning strike can turn into my
next<00:04:47.760> stealth<00:04:48.090> chopper<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.960> basically<00:04:49.680> it's

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
next stealth chopper so basically it's

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.920 
next stealth chopper so basically it's
pretty<00:04:50.250> easy<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.670> roll<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.630> there<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.840> is

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
pretty easy to roll up and there it is

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.110 
pretty easy to roll up and there it is
there's<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.400> stealth<00:04:53.400> chopper<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.760> meant<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
got another stealth chopper and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.060 
got another stealth chopper and
basically<00:04:58.140> as<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.350> can<00:04:58.380> see<00:04:58.650> they<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.770> keep

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
basically as you can see they just keep

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.820 
basically as you can see they just keep
rolling<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.670> and<00:04:59.910> it's<00:05:00.840> it's<00:05:01.230> not<00:05:01.440> because<00:05:01.740> I'm

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
rolling up and it's it's not because I'm

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.050 
rolling up and it's it's not because I'm
just<00:05:02.070> getting<00:05:02.250> kills<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.550> am<00:05:02.670> playing<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
just getting kills I am playing the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.940 
just getting kills I am playing the
objective<00:05:03.150> as<00:05:03.630> well<00:05:03.870> though<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.590> that's<00:05:04.770> why

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
objective as well though so that's why

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.230 
objective as well though so that's why
I'm<00:05:05.220> suggesting<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:05.940> play<00:05:06.120> an

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
I'm suggesting that you play an

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.180 
I'm suggesting that you play an
objective<00:05:06.750> game-mode<00:05:07.290> if<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.860> were<00:05:07.980> playing

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
objective game-mode if you were playing

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.770 
objective game-mode if you were playing
free-for-all<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:08.940> believe<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.420> get<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.570> hundred

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
free-for-all I believe you get a hundred

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.300 
free-for-all I believe you get a hundred
points<00:05:10.050> per<00:05:10.380> kill<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.740> free-for-all<00:05:11.130> which

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
points per kill and free-for-all which

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.420 
points per kill and free-for-all which
ends<00:05:11.610> up<00:05:11.700> being<00:05:12.080> four<00:05:13.080> kills<00:05:13.470> just<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.100> UAV

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
ends up being four kills just for a UAV

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.670 
ends up being four kills just for a UAV
when<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:14.910> used<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.240> be<00:05:15.330> three<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.320> everything

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
when it used to be three so everything

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.010 
when it used to be three so everything
is<00:05:16.800> um<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:17.070> much<00:05:17.430> harder<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.510> get<00:05:18.690> if<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:18.990> don't

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
is um is much harder to get if you don't

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.500 
is um is much harder to get if you don't
play<00:05:19.380> an<00:05:19.470> objective<00:05:19.980> based<00:05:20.190> game<00:05:20.520> type<00:05:20.790> but<00:05:21.420> as

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510

comfortable like you'll be able to get

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.560 
comfortable like you'll be able to get
enough<00:06:04.980> kills<00:06:05.220> or<00:06:05.400> whatever<00:06:05.640> but<00:06:05.850> like<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.390> said

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
enough kills or whatever but like I said

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.050 
enough kills or whatever but like I said
I<00:06:06.600> mean<00:06:07.130> legitimately<00:06:08.130> because<00:06:08.640> you<00:06:08.790> get<00:06:09.030> a

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
I mean legitimately because you get a

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.090 
I mean legitimately because you get a
hundred<00:06:09.270> points<00:06:09.660> for<00:06:09.690> confirming<00:06:10.169> kills<00:06:10.560> like

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
hundred points for confirming kills like

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.830 
hundred points for confirming kills like
you<00:06:11.250> could<00:06:11.460> run<00:06:11.640> around<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.210> not<00:06:12.450> kill

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
you could run around and not kill

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.960 
you could run around and not kill
anything<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.560> literally<00:06:14.130> just<00:06:14.310> pick<00:06:14.520> up<00:06:14.700> dog

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970
