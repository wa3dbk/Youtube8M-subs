00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 very good youtube and today I bring you with 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.040
 a new tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 server in several fields with hamas and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.010
 do not confuse it with several companions 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.370
 since there are many people who 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.370
 confuse 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.250
 the bad company 2 is as it is as the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.660
 wash the film 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.660
 I do not know, I think 5 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 but good 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.150
 The first thing is first to have a machin 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.150
 true minga machine 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.770
 before everything for this is what has 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.190
 what to do the host or host 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.390
 create a new network 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.390
 puts the network 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.659
 a password 23 and 13 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.620
 already created 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.600
 the net 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.630
 those who are going to enter have to enter 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.840
 mandatory clear 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.960
 they put the name name this 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 the leader of the network and then they put the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.390
 password the 123 would be in my case game 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.490
 because just some stuffing 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.880
 but good they would have to leave the one of 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.380
 jamaica opened and between álvarez was 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.759
 I'm going to explain the field with 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 images because I'm going to last a 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.200
 eternity if it is for there forgiveness without 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.470
 I love him again raise him 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.170
 screencast things that bothers me 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 I'm going to teach with images because he 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.840
 so late and an eternity in simply 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.840
 enter and they have to record 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 Thank you 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.830
 good once the camera 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.140
 once 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.330
 in the barrel 2 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.910
 they press multiplayer 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.020
 this this had to be the host gives to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.020
 create a network 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.799
 here you can put anything while 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.450
 have the hamas open will the ip be 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.159
 directly to the march you have to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.159
 put what will be lepén and nothing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 once created you have to give it to start 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 server obligatorily so that the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.280
 server opens 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.329
 and once you're in, you can 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.379
 play can be entered and you can play 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.379
 Now this part has to do it 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.070
 who is going to enter the game has 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.530
 you do have to give a to join 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.030
 Internet 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.030
 then go to connect to ip 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.190
 after that where did you address 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 ip puts the ip of hamas and the host or 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.520
 host and the password if you put it if 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.970
 you win and by the way the port let you 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 same as it is 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.200
 and that of accepting and starting to enter 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.600
 Well that's it 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 it is very simple 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.730
 I do not know why the complication of that 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.920
 almost nobody knows 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.120
 we only know two people already 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.739
 is it so 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.490
 and I think now there are going to be many more 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.700
 because in French we did not know 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.980
 the way to create networks and with hamas 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.370
 but good is everything I hope that I have 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.019
 liked comment but with a tutorial of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.170
 law if they liked it and subscribe 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.819
 for 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.050
 to be informed of the entire tutorial 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.100
 that I do and gameplays too 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.100
 Well, see you
