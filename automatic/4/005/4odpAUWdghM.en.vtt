okay<00:00:04.630> this<00:00:04.899> is<00:00:05.020> going<00:00:05.140> to<00:00:05.260> be<00:00:05.380> a<00:00:05.410> hands-on

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:06.099 
okay this is going to be a hands-on

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:11.280 
okay this is going to be a hands-on
video<00:00:06.880> for<00:00:07.420> my<00:00:08.200> wheel<00:00:08.500> adapters<00:00:09.010> calm<00:00:10.290> now

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
video for my wheel adapters calm now

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.000 
video for my wheel adapters calm now
this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.910> a<00:00:13.240> wheel<00:00:13.540> adapter<00:00:14.640> as<00:00:15.640> thickness<00:00:17.010> see

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
this is a wheel adapter as thickness see

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.000 
this is a wheel adapter as thickness see
this<00:00:18.190> is<00:00:18.310> how<00:00:18.460> thick<00:00:18.760> it<00:00:18.940> is<00:00:19.440> it<00:00:20.440> has<00:00:20.619> a<00:00:20.650> bolt

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
this is how thick it is it has a bolt

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.760 
this is how thick it is it has a bolt
pattern<00:00:21.660> though<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.780> pattern<00:00:23.110> references

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
pattern though the pattern references

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.609 
pattern though the pattern references
how<00:00:23.949> far<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:24.369> is<00:00:24.460> between<00:00:25.440> the<00:00:26.440> lug<00:00:26.680> nuts

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
how far it is between the lug nuts

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.459 
how far it is between the lug nuts
typically<00:00:29.619> it's<00:00:30.130> measured<00:00:30.640> from<00:00:31.109> across<00:00:32.109> like

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
typically it's measured from across like

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.680 
typically it's measured from across like
this<00:00:34.409> it<00:00:35.409> would<00:00:35.530> be<00:00:36.179> different<00:00:37.179> ways<00:00:37.510> you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
this it would be different ways you

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.270 
this it would be different ways you
measure<00:00:37.929> them<00:00:38.199> but<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.679> go<00:00:38.800> into<00:00:38.949> that<00:00:39.159> in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
measure them but and go into that in

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.340 
measure them but and go into that in
another<00:00:39.309> video<00:00:39.699> but<00:00:40.120> anyway<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.139> is<00:00:41.199> your

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
another video but anyway this is your

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.319 
another video but anyway this is your
bolt<00:00:41.649> pattern<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.460> distance<00:00:42.879> between<00:00:43.030> your

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
bolt pattern the distance between your

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
bolt pattern the distance between your
lug<00:00:43.539> nuts

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.169 

this<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.399> wheel<00:00:48.670> studs<00:00:50.339> this<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.549> wheel<00:00:51.729> studs

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
this is wheel studs this is wheel studs

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.500 
this is wheel studs this is wheel studs
sticking<00:00:52.719> out<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:53.049> the<00:00:53.139> adapter<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.449> a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
sticking out of the adapter and then a

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:04.200 
sticking out of the adapter and then a
lug<00:00:55.780> nut<00:00:57.359> goes<00:00:58.359> on<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.609> a<00:01:00.639> wheel<00:01:00.909> stud<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:04.030> have

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
lug nut goes on to a wheel stud you have

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:13.410 
lug nut goes on to a wheel stud you have
the<00:01:04.360> car<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:04.960> side<00:01:05.310> wheel<00:01:06.310> on<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.730> side

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.380 

yeah<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.440> was<00:01:14.620> your<00:01:14.770> car<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.240> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
yeah this was your car and this is the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.680 
yeah this was your car and this is the
adapter<00:01:20.370> it<00:01:21.370> goes<00:01:21.670> together<00:01:21.940> like<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.850> here

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
adapter it goes together like so here

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.420 
adapter it goes together like so here
the<00:01:25.840> car<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.409> then<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.430> adapter<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.280> go

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the car and then the adapter when you go

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.020 
the car and then the adapter when you go
to<00:01:33.490> put<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.850> adapter<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.540> car<00:01:35.820> notice<00:01:36.820> its

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
to put the adapter on the car notice its

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.780 
to put the adapter on the car notice its
movement<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.909> down<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.420> moving

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
movement see this down here and moving

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.190 
movement see this down here and moving
the<00:01:42.790> adapter<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:44.070> okay<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.899> can<00:01:47.020> take

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
the adapter is okay now you can take

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.050 
the adapter is okay now you can take
this<00:01:48.240> wheel<00:01:49.240> but<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:51.039> take<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.399> lug<00:01:51.670> nut<00:01:51.910> and

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
this wheel but you take a lug nut and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:01.460 
this wheel but you take a lug nut and
you<00:01:52.210> put<00:01:52.360> one<00:01:52.390> here<00:01:53.020> put<00:01:55.500> three<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:59.130> here

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
you put one here put three on there here

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:17.150 
you put one here put three on there here
and<00:02:02.470> there<00:02:10.320> then<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.910> down<00:02:16.150> close

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and there then when you get down close

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.449 
and there then when you get down close
you<00:02:18.160> want<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:19.290> leave<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> little<00:02:21.340> bit

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you want to leave it just a little bit

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.949 
you want to leave it just a little bit
loose<00:02:21.959> or<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:22.989> can<00:02:23.320> still<00:02:23.560> move<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.690> take

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
loose or you can still move it and take

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.430 
loose or you can still move it and take
these<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.850> yeah<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.600> want<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.900> feel<00:02:29.170> that
