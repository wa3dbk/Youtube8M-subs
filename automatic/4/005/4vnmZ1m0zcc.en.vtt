00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
make sure you start off with trains that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.220 
make sure you start off with trains that
will<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> much<00:00:36.090> easier<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
much better result we'll start with our

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.770 
much better result we'll start with our
sponge<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.379> since<00:00:41.370> she's<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:42.059> pale<00:00:42.420> I'm

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
sponge and since she's very pale I'm

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
sponge and since she's very pale I'm
going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> darken<00:00:43.350> her<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:44.010> solve<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
going to darken her just solve it so

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
clean sharp lines again we'll get a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.240 
clean sharp lines again we'll get a
synthetic<00:01:59.390> brush<00:01:59.509> way<00:02:00.380> easier<00:02:00.829> because<00:02:00.979> it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
synthetic brush way easier because it's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.550 
synthetic brush way easier because it's
flat<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.780> load<00:02:02.990> up<00:02:03.020> your<00:02:03.140> brush<00:02:03.319> both<00:02:04.069> sides

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
flat you load up your brush both sides

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.110
