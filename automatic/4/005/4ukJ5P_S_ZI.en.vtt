streaks and I really hope they do just
because<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.470> seems<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.979> taking

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
these dead streets to the next level and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
these dead streets to the next level and
guys<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.590> modern<00:01:07.979> warfare<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.490> had<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
guys I know modern warfare two had the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.130 
guys I know modern warfare two had the
dead<00:01:08.939> streaks<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> mean<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.080> were

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
dead streaks and I mean they were

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
dead streaks and I mean they were
annoying<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.650> had<00:01:10.799> painkiller<00:01:11.310> martyrdom

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
annoying you had painkiller martyrdom

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
annoying you had painkiller martyrdom
and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.200> more<00:01:13.380> final<00:01:13.680> stand

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and I think it was one more final stand

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
and I think it was one more final stand
and<00:01:14.189> guys<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.180> were<00:01:15.240> annoying<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:15.930> they

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and guys they were annoying but they

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
and guys they were annoying but they
weren't<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.530> huge<00:01:16.860> huge<00:01:17.100> factor<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> game

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
weren't a huge huge factor in the game

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
weren't a huge huge factor in the game
the<00:01:18.360> only<00:01:18.659> reason<00:01:18.869> why<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.530> didn't<00:01:19.830> like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the only reason why people didn't like

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
the only reason why people didn't like
