00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.639 
obviously very important i think all the
boys<00:02:03.729> were<00:02:04.119> looking<00:02:04.899> back<00:02:05.259> it<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.560> just

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
boys were looking back it you just

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.499 
boys were looking back it you just
quickly<00:02:05.889> as<00:02:06.039> possible<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:06.819> game<00:02:07.060> and

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
quickly as possible to in this game and

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.730 
quickly as possible to in this game and
they've<00:02:07.659> got<00:02:07.780> four<00:02:07.899> last<00:02:08.080> week<00:02:08.259> cover<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.649> it

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
they've got four last week cover so it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.380 
they've got four last week cover so it
doesn't<00:02:09.039> doesn't<00:02:09.550> make<00:02:09.759> up<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:09.910> last<00:02:10.210> week

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
doesn't doesn't make up for last week

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.310 
doesn't doesn't make up for last week
completely<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.650> nice<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> backbone
