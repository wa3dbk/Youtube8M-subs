grace lightnings been available for

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.500 
grace lightnings been available for
years<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> their<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.390> are

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
years but it's one of their things are

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.150 
years but it's one of their things are
not<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> lot<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> people<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
not a lot of people know about it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.920 
not a lot of people know about it
basically<00:00:20.460> treats<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:21.029> line<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.660> makes<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
basically treats your line and makes it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
basically treats your line and makes it
a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.140> smoother<00:00:22.680> makes<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> come<00:00:23.400> off<00:00:23.519> your

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a lot smoother makes it come off your

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
a lot smoother makes it come off your
spool<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.720> quicker<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.380> less<00:00:25.529> friction

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
spool a lot quicker a lot less friction

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
spool a lot quicker a lot less friction
and<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> result<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> few<00:00:27.779> extra

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and as a result you get a few extra

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650 
and as a result you get a few extra
yards<00:00:28.710> what<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.550> gonna<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.480> have

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
yards what I'm gonna do it's gonna have

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
yards what I'm gonna do it's gonna have
a<00:00:30.689> couple<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> casts<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.560> cast<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
a couple of casts the first cast I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.410 
a couple of casts the first cast I
haven't<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.430> any<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.700> stuff<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.210> reel

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
haven't got any of this stuff on my reel

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
haven't got any of this stuff on my reel
so<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.290> cost<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.860> mark<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> up

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
so I'm gonna cost it out mark it up

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.479 
so I'm gonna cost it out mark it up
really<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.719> put<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.739> carts<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
really in put some of this on carts that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.340 
really in put some of this on carts that
again<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.480> much<00:00:39.660> difference<00:00:40.110> now

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
again and see it as much difference now

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
again and see it as much difference now
obviously<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.219> depends<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.579> how<00:00:41.700> much

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
obviously it depends on how much

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
obviously it depends on how much
pressure<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.270> put<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.350> gonna

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pressure I put on so you're just gonna

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
pressure I put on so you're just gonna
have<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> believe<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.670> I'm

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
have to believe me on this one I'm

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
have to believe me on this one I'm
afraid<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.329> only<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.379> lid<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
afraid I only got a little lid on it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
afraid I only got a little lid on it
about<00:00:47.160> 2<00:00:47.610> ounces<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.690> about

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
about 2 ounces or so it's not about

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
about 2 ounces or so it's not about
hitting<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> huge<00:00:49.469> distances<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
hitting a huge distances it's about the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
hitting a huge distances it's about the
difference<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> makes<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.989> I'll<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.800> give<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
difference it makes I I'll just give it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
difference it makes I I'll just give it
a<00:00:53.160> good<00:00:53.309> whack<00:00:53.780> first<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> all

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.660 

probably<00:01:05.470> about<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.650> hundred<00:01:05.740> yards<00:01:06.310> just

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
probably about a hundred yards just

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.270 
probably about a hundred yards just
tighten<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.030> up<00:01:07.590> put<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.620> little<00:01:08.800> marker<00:01:09.130> on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
tighten that up put a little marker on

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
tighten that up put a little marker on
there

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
there

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.790 
there
there<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.810> go<00:01:10.930> gotten<00:01:11.290> me<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.410> little<00:01:11.560> tape

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
there we go gotten me a little tape

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.969 
there we go gotten me a little tape
marker<00:01:12.190> on<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.110> cranking<00:01:16.979> right

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
marker on now it's just cranking right

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.680 
marker on now it's just cranking right
so<00:01:18.130> apply<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.400> stuff<00:01:18.700> oh<00:01:18.970> you<00:01:19.150> do

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
so apply this stuff oh you do

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:29.330 
so apply this stuff oh you do
it's<00:01:20.110> literally<00:01:20.880> spread<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.940> few<00:01:22.180> drops<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.630> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.920 

future<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.670> few<00:01:31.000> drops<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.690> probably

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
future up to a few drops here I probably

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.880 
future up to a few drops here I probably
took<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:33.400> than<00:01:33.430> need<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.440> give<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:35.560> good<00:01:35.710> I'll

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
took more than need to give it good I'll

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.400 
took more than need to give it good I'll
grease<00:01:36.220> up<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:37.750> many<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:38.050> it's<00:01:38.170> mark

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
grease up how many but it's mark

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.350 
grease up how many but it's mark
hutchinson<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.460> first<00:01:39.670> put<00:01:39.820> me<00:01:39.970> on<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.240> this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
hutchinson that first put me on to this

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.090 
hutchinson that first put me on to this
obviously<00:01:40.840> he's<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.400> massive<00:01:42.400> caster<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:44.100> ace

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
obviously he's a massive caster and ace

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300 
obviously he's a massive caster and ace
way<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.430> by<00:01:45.820> putting<00:01:46.119> at<00:01:46.360> least<00:01:46.600> five<00:01:47.590> yards<00:01:48.130> on

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
way is by putting at least five yards on

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.609 
way is by putting at least five yards on
which<00:01:49.030> might<00:01:49.270> not<00:01:49.450> sound<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.780> lot<00:01:49.930> but<00:01:50.200> when

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
which might not sound a lot but when

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.090 
which might not sound a lot but when
you're<00:01:50.770> fishing<00:01:51.040> 160<00:01:51.850> yards<00:01:51.940> out

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you're fishing 160 yards out

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.389 
you're fishing 160 yards out
yeah<00:01:57.509> right<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.920> sounded<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.220> went<00:02:00.280> a

more<00:02:33.340> abrasion<00:02:34.000> resistant<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.170> you're<00:02:35.500> going

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
more abrasion resistant and you're going

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
fishing in lots of weed than that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.460

because<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.840> makes<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.230> much<00:02:38.410> more

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
because it makes it that much more
