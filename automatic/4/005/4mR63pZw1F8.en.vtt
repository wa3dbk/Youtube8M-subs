 Brazilian version of the rock choices 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:55.480
 [Music] 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.739

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.579
 I still have to do my duty to 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.699

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.700

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.800
 It was so cool to play here but Matheus 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.409
 We have to do the duty for tomorrow. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:28.090
 if it did not give time since everyone goes 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:30.039
 enter this I also have to go 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.570

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:24.400
 [Music] 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.930

 point in a point valley but homework 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.820
 It was made for us to memorize what 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.950
 we learned at school and so when you 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:13.220

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:27.719
 celebrating at that time can not be 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:31.149

 I was speaking 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.130
 because that's right now you'll be the one who 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.169
 not going to walk with the musician because 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.569
 chose to listen to music instead of 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.690
 to study 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.770
 I know one should have done it. 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.280
 Excuse me 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.039
 You're excused, but it will not do. 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.409

 every day we have to make several 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.340
 choices from the time we wake up 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.680
 Until the time when we go to sleep, everything that 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.199
 we chose to do has the result after 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.569
 always choose to do the right things 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.430
 It will be better for you
