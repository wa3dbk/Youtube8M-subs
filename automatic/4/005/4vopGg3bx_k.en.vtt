00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.980 

and<00:01:38.090> someone<00:01:38.509> famous<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:39.050> -<00:01:39.789> make<00:01:43.630> time<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.810> see

and someone famous in - make time to see

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:15.670 
and someone famous in - make time to see
my<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:45.590> Uranus

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.809 

and<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.739> thought<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.099> myself<00:02:17.220> -<00:02:17.459> something

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and I thought to myself - something

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.009 
and I thought to myself - something
wrong<00:02:18.000> here<00:02:18.239> because<00:02:18.330> why<00:02:18.660> does<00:02:18.840> he<00:02:18.989> feel

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
wrong here because why does he feel

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.589 
wrong here because why does he feel
small<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.310> when<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.459> look<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.030> universe

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
small but when I look up in the universe

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.860 
small but when I look up in the universe
I<00:02:21.630> feel<00:02:22.440> large<00:02:22.790> then<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.880> realized<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.750> problem

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
I feel large then I realized the problem

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.000 
I feel large then I realized the problem
was<00:02:25.140> his<00:02:25.650> ego<00:02:26.190> was<00:02:26.370> too<00:02:26.640> large<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.000> begin<00:02:27.360> with

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
was his ego was too large to begin with

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.030 
was his ego was too large to begin with
he<00:02:29.010> came<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> problem<00:02:30.830> thinking<00:02:31.830> too

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
he came to the problem thinking too

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160 
he came to the problem thinking too
highly<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.610> who<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.239> he<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.989> begin

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
highly of who and what he was to begin

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.589 
highly of who and what he was to begin
with<00:02:34.500> because<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:35.849> everything<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
with because then everything that

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.870 
with because then everything that
happened<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.049> show<00:02:37.610> destabilized<00:02:38.610> his

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
happened in the show destabilized his

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.680 
happened in the show destabilized his
self-image

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
self-image

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.770 
self-image
whereas<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.739> know<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> molecules<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.660> my

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
whereas I know that the molecules in my

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
whereas I know that the molecules in my
body<00:02:43.019> are<00:02:43.260> traceable<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:44.060> phenomenon<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.269> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
body are traceable to phenomenon in the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.180 
body are traceable to phenomenon in the
cosmos<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.110> our<00:02:49.260> 15<00:02:49.830> pounds

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
cosmos and that and it's our 15 pounds

cosmos and that and it's our 15 pounds
of<00:02:50.280> grey<00:02:50.489> matter<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.940> figured<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.450> out

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
of grey matter that figured this out

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.509 
of grey matter that figured this out
when<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.500> calculation<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.160> shows

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
when I do the calculation that shows

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.610 
when I do the calculation that shows
that<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.390> take<00:02:54.569> all<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.110> iron<00:02:55.260> from

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that if you take all of the iron from

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.680 
that if you take all of the iron from
the<00:02:55.680> hemoglobin<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.849> people<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.360> the

recover that much iron out of their
blood<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.480> realize<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.810> iron<00:03:04.140> from

Stardust in the highest exalted way one

00:03:25.590 --> 00:04:13.650 
Stardust in the highest exalted way one
can<00:03:25.739> use<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.519> phrase

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
you see one thing is I can live with

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.370 
you see one thing is I can live with
doubt<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.640> uncertainty<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.600> not<00:04:20.630> knowing<00:04:21.020> I

doubt and uncertainty and not knowing I
think<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.400> much<00:04:22.670> more<00:04:22.780> interesting<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.990> live

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
think it's much more interesting to live

think it's much more interesting to live
not<00:04:25.220> knowing<00:04:25.280> than<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> have<00:04:26.120> answers<00:04:26.720> which

might<00:04:27.080> be<00:04:27.230> wrong

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
might be wrong

might be wrong
I<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:29.630> approximate<00:04:30.320> answers<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.890> possible

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
I have approximate answers and possible

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.530 
I have approximate answers and possible
beliefs<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:31.970> different<00:04:32.270> degrees<00:04:32.360> of

things I don't know anything about such
as<00:04:38.690> whether<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.530> means<00:04:39.680> anything<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.280> ask<00:04:40.460> why

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
as whether it means anything to ask why

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.750 
as whether it means anything to ask why
we're<00:04:41.510> here<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.830> what<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.190> question<00:04:43.400> might

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
we're here and what the question might

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.310 
we're here and what the question might
mean<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.060> might<00:04:44.390> think<00:04:44.600> about<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> little<00:04:45.080> bit<00:04:45.230> if

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
mean I might think about a little bit if

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.050 
mean I might think about a little bit if
I<00:04:45.410> can't<00:04:45.680> figure<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:46.100> out<00:04:46.220> then<00:04:46.790> I<00:04:46.880> go<00:04:47.030> to

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
I can't figure it out then I go to

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.320 
I can't figure it out then I go to
something<00:04:47.480> out<00:04:48.340> but<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.370> don't<00:04:49.640> have<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:50.150> know

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
something out but I don't have to know

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.150
