00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.740
 hello everyone welcome to a video more 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.300
 this is a video that I made almost last 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.950
 moment 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.070
 just left now the new update 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.020
 from station vista the update 2.0 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.390
 that among what most important thing 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.210
 what it brings is obviously the compatibility 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.520
 with the playstation plus that has already been 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.240
 announced for habitat which brings 6 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.320
 free games among those uncharted 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.600
 wright gras 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 but in this video what are we going to do 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.110
 it's basically set up the mail 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 electronic that is a new option that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 comes with the firmware then I am 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.829
 understanding for the first time so 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.329
 let's see how it goes first what 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.190
 asks us is to add an email account 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 electronic we can add with the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 mail of yahoo gmail with that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.750
 another type of mail probably if 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.330
 we want to make a hotmail mail a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 outlook broker in my case I 'm going to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.550
 use the gmail 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.910
 let's put your name with which 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.440
 will see the recipients ok this is for 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 the name that you will see when you 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.720
 send then let's put him 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.540
 and point 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 and then the email 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 mail is this circle people write me 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 17 gmail 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.400
 the gmail.com senses if you're doing 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.550
 a gmail account but hey it seems 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.440
 probably stop playing the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.640
 password which is 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.640
 that is my password 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.680
 of the data we are going to enter is 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.680

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.340

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.079
