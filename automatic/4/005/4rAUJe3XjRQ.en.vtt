00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.270
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.690
 tells us that I think it's going to be the most 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.240
 controversy that I have never ever raised in my 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.620
 channel and it does not surprise me since good 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.300
 you know that everyone has always 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.480
 lost dedicated servers so that what 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.430
 puteen or ebro I think it's something already 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.780
 necessary not to have dedication that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.369
 like in consoles that what I started yes 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.900
 they have had a delivery that 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.550
 Athens seriously dedicated forgiveness if I've 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.410
 wrong but I think I think that 's the way 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.460
 so good to the people as I say by 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.010
 he has always asked for dedicated servers 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.300
 in what is the world of consoles is 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.699
 that many times for not opening the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 connection and this kind of thing well then 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:40.440
 of the major nelson raffle 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.560
 from Microsoft, he said on his twitter 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.120
 basically that the last ones are going to have 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.070
 Dedicated servers in the xbox one no 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 I know if it's going to stay exclusively 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 on x2 web but they say that these thanks to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.440
 the cloud and all this kind of stuff and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.810
 it seems that the only capos everything 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 the good cloud the only one that opted for the 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.830
 cloud I mean in this generation so 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 strongly 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.940
 it's the same one with which I do not know if 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 will happen that also in place and they are four 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 or what will happen to me smells like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.840
 exclusivity again what of the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 dedicated servers and I miss them 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 since the tlc also go to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.030
 follow a month before as not in xbox one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 With which 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.810
 people are going to pay a lot that the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 people get very angry and I'm going to 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.920
 come I'm going to come the relations of 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.560
 the people and as I say good this is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.729
 said in gamescom and at 7 it will be 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.700
 the gamescom conference as I say 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.170
 of are and so good we'll see to see if 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.540
 they end up saying something like that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.390
 similar but I get the feeling that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.670
 not so the truth is that then the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.420
 people like I say is not going to take anything 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.880
 well and good I really do not say that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 will go wrong in prison 4 logically 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 I do not play it for good if you have a 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.430
 Decent line, it will not go for you 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.590
 nothing bad, not in fact 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.730
 in the USA I do not think they have problems of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.400
 Connection 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.840
 if they are 3 and xbox when at the time of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.729
 play talk comfortable for example with 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.259
 which I think this has been a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.300
 initiative to sell a little more in 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.820
 Europe which is where really well you 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.380
 it took a bit to microsoft not 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.540
 have a little more reservations along with 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.190
 the news of difficult 14 that you what 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 give away with equipment one and this I think 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.380
 that to triumphed very very strongly and 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.420
 so well I do not know what I do not know what 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.790
 I would think you do not know if you think that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 good will end up including in the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.330
 company are four or stays as 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.030
 exclusive for xbox which I the truth 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.560
 who then announce major nelson is 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.010
 worrying not worrying for all 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.570
 because it would mean that basically 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 it's like announcing an exclusivity 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.080
 so good nothing more kids 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.110
 let's wait to see how it progresses 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.100
 story but I see it a little bad so 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.100
 until next time
