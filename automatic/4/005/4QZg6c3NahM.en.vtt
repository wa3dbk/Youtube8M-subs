pipetting is made with brown sugar and

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.800 
pipetting is made with brown sugar and
this<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.500> also<00:01:54.799> important<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.750> here<00:01:56.929> we<00:01:56.959> go

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
the line will lose its sour taste this

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:22.280 
the line will lose its sour taste this
is<00:02:13.970> another<00:02:14.180> secret
