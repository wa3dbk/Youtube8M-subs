00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
the specs of the Desire 820 and 8 20's
are<00:00:42.930> pretty<00:00:43.200> much<00:00:43.530> similar<00:00:44.129> except<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
are pretty much similar except for the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
are pretty much similar except for the
fact<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.780> phone<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> single<00:00:46.860> 8<00:00:47.100> core

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
fact that this phone got a single 8 core

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
fact that this phone got a single 8 core
processor<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.780> Desire<00:00:49.079> 820<00:00:49.410> had<00:00:50.039> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
processor and the Desire 820 had two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
processor and the Desire 820 had two
quad-core<00:00:51.020> processors<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> phone<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

show<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.509> multi-touch<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
show you the multi-touch so it is a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.380 
show you the multi-touch so it is a
five-point<00:01:33.960> multi-touch<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> phone

eight megapixel front facing camera and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.480 
eight megapixel front facing camera and
now<00:01:41.070> let's<00:01:41.400> come<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.979> sensors<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.220> phone

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
now let's come to the sensors this phone

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.200 
now let's come to the sensors this phone
sport<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.810> Direction<00:01:46.470> sensor

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
sport so we have Direction sensor

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
sport so we have Direction sensor
acceleration<00:01:48.210> sensor<00:01:48.630> light<00:01:48.869> sensor<00:01:49.380> eCampus

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
acceleration sensor light sensor eCampus

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
acceleration sensor light sensor eCampus
and<00:01:50.280> proximity<00:01:50.939> sensor<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.450> these<00:01:51.630> five

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and proximity sensor so these five

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.440 
and proximity sensor so these five
sensors<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.619> supported<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.090> require

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
sensors are supported we really require

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.889 
sensors are supported we really require
the<00:01:54.479> other<00:01:54.840> sensors<00:01:55.939> mentioned<00:01:56.939> over<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the other sensors mentioned over here so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.190 
the other sensors mentioned over here so
let's<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.649> antutu<00:01:59.340> benchmark<00:01:59.460> us<00:02:00.210> gives

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
let's see what antutu benchmark us gives

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.760 
let's see what antutu benchmark us gives
it<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.740> score<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.270> 44,000<00:02:03.270> 592<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
it it's a score of 44,000 592 which is a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160 
it it's a score of 44,000 592 which is a
remarkable<00:02:05.100> score<00:02:05.820> guys<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:06.659> let's<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.049> how

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
remarkable score guys now let's see how

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.859 
remarkable score guys now let's see how
this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.590> stands<00:02:08.369> against<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.879> devices<00:02:09.239> so

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
this one stands against other devices so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.250 
this one stands against other devices so
the<00:02:09.959> phone<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.200> rang<00:02:10.679> alongside<00:02:11.160> one

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the phone is rang alongside one

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.289 
the phone is rang alongside one
plus<00:02:12.409> one<00:02:12.650> I'm<00:02:12.830> singing<00:02:13.189> alongside<00:02:13.430> because
