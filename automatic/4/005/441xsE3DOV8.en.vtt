 new bumper 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.950
 plastic products unlike 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 metal 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.690
 possess the worst primer adhesion 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.369
 material and covered malah therefore 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 plastic surface needs to be activated 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 special cleaner for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.150
 plastics and adhesive primer often to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 unfortunately the new parts are not perfect on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 surfaces may be small 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 scratches formed on the parts in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.769
 the transport process is also 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 unscrupulous plastic manufacturers 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 which saves on its quality 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 as a result, predict all properties 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 such a surface is not possible it should be 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.219
 additionally activated by grinding and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 repair minor damage with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 a pair of filling soil for your own 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.059
 insurance plastic surface 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.890
 before painting it is desirable to grind 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.719
 abrasive material and using 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.870
 eccentric machine handle 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.870
 surface 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.899
 hard to reach places such as 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.699
 technological bends and corners should 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.030
 to grind dead fiber 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.820
 dex 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.450
 lie so-called scotch bright

 gray p600 grit principle 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.320
 the technology does not need to pass 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.289
 nothing matte no plastic but 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.289
 again the realities of our life show 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:25.390
 what is plastic which is not quite 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.550
 applies for painting with 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.710
 standard technology over vampire ready 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.799
 for painting it means we put it in the chamber and 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.080
 proceed to painting before applying 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.270
 adhesion primer plastic is cleaned 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.069
 mobihel cleaning agent for plastics 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.049
 this tool prepares the surface 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.580
 to the subsequent layers of paintwork 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.860
 cover and removes effect 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.140
 electrified sti plastic leftovers 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.950
 cleaners are removed using clean 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.810
 dry wipes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.230
