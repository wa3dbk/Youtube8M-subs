use this team and i won division 1 first
time<00:00:49.059> unbeaten<00:00:49.749> i<00:00:49.899> think<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.199> 19<00:00:50.589> games<00:00:50.920> and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850

time unbeaten i think of 19 games and
drew<00:00:52.390> three<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.109> that's<00:00:53.319> a<00:00:53.409> pretty<00:00:53.559> decent

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
drew three so that's a pretty decent

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.979 
drew three so that's a pretty decent

Soldado<00:03:42.890> has<00:03:43.160> an<00:03:43.400> incredible<00:03:44.360> shot<00:03:44.690> he

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
Soldado has an incredible shot he

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.750 
Soldado has an incredible shot he
doesn't<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:45.980> much<00:03:46.160> pace<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.580> world

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
doesn't have that much pace in the world

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.850 
doesn't have that much pace in the world
but<00:03:46.880> then<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.209> does<00:03:47.360> he<00:03:47.540> gwine<00:03:47.750> he<00:03:48.260> only<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.470> 78

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
but then so does he gwine he only a 78

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.100 
but then so does he gwine he only a 78
pace<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:49.340> actually<00:03:50.060> sold<00:03:50.240> Oda<00:03:50.390> has<00:03:50.600> more<00:03:50.870> pace
