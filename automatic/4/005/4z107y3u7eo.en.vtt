 bach 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.690

 you can sing along with bach 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.520
 a day studying with amateurs 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.110

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 how far you go and level fun 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 People acquainted with other aspects 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.059
 of your music because they probably 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.520
 normally have to deal with 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 so yes I always find it exciting 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.340
 to see where you come and as the audience 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.260
 it takes so that I think a lot 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.250
 nice experience for everyone we where 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.629
 looking forward to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.810

 11 am in the cathedral city 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.080
 Among other things, the afternoon is too 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.640
 Kristof listened to Amsterdam 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.440

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.390
 most tons of merchant with his own am 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.670
 he desk cooking radiation choir he 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.229
 will perform cantatas from bach 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.299
 i have felt the bach is an architect 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.440
 who has a lot of resources in hand and 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.380
 know exactly which means he needs 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.200
 and now most family and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 it provided that taxi was used and yes that makes them 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.990
 were allowed to come along 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.770
 special is the occurrence of amandine 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.289
 wr 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.470

 what does the max reger do on the bach day 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.760
 and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 yellowish you can't live without it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.399
 reason because otherwise it would not be on the piano 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.140
 can play 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.739
 So grete is incredibly important 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 been to translate it to the piano 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.190
 , and therefore is nice 1930 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.430
 of course that this is the combination 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.100
