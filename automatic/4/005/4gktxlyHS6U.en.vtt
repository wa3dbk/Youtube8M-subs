00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.040 
one gender I I think it's probably all
in<00:02:17.220> all<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.550> much<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> better<00:02:18.120> way<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.780> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
in all of much a better way to do it I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.960 
in all of much a better way to do it I
think<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.650> better<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.160> co-educational

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
