00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 a whole new bmw face and true 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.420
 yet the hear met 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.160
 to the active tour the first bmw with 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.860
 front wheel drive and maybe a lot 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920
 revolutionary first car of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.039
 bmw now comes in geneva a car from 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.740
 There is something new about the pillar 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 a slice bmw more so too 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 own model of the grand tourer in there with 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.420
 seven sit and that this room or 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 can that look at us now 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 for the driver remains the grand tourer 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.719
 actually everything as before the cockpit 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.550
 moves a bit closer there are against 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 surcharge this eight-speed automatic and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 what we know from driving this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.450
 special bmw feel the space cars 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.450
 The grand tourer will be different in the end 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 I'm just waiting for this bmw 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 Still career as a taxi maybe 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 but too expensive 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.320
 the grand tourer is again 1250 euro 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.690
 more expensive than the active tour 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 There is more freedom of movement for that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 sit higher and the longitudinal 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.640
 adjustable backseat as standard 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 longer wheelbase eleven centimeters more 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 the bmw engineers use it most of all 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 to enter the back to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.450
 facilitate and now comes the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.450
 gymnastics hour 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.390
 and that's what bmw engineers call it 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.230
 easy entry to german easy entry 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.490
 because you can also get the hocks 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.860
 After all , no one is bending 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.990
 Children's birthday or that's it 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 a place for the children's birthday at 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.440
 the little kevin with must then he can 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.300
 this left crawling in here 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.590
 Of course I can also flat everything 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.479
 place so I can get the biggest 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.930
 luggage compartment throughout the bmw program 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 namely up to 1900 5 liters this 1905 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.729
 again trunk tell us that the bmw 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.280
 developers a vw touran to the model 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.990
 have taken as they also say that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.050
 a 3er touring can be dangerous 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 if the grand tourer from 13 june with 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.700
 A total of five engines on the market 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.100
 comes and to praise the good 27,000 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.130
 what they do not say 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.510
 there we clearly see bmw builds 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.510
 really a bern now
