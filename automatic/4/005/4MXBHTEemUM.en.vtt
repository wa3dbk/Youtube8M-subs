00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.650
 here is again fix what I show today 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.710
 we will make her infinite 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.669
 So, dear god unfortunately only 5000 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.849
 for that per minute per minute i would 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.849
 say and that they will be the ns time i will 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.220
 then show you how to enter 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.829
 therefore I could see now 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.140
 to get 5000 dollars 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.920
 that is always different you can 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.989
 also get 10,000 or even 3,000 and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.960
 yes we can do the land you just have to 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.390
 then go to network settings 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 Do you go on the Internet? 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.429
 disturb then comes there on a message 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.519
 okay then it is also quite 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.899
 important on custom and then 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.739
 So pushes wireless or with 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.680
 network cable i have wireless then 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 he passes everything on to the ns 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 attitude there is then easy 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.960
 wanted to open and enter your dnf 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.420
 as I said, I'll still be there 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.160
 Pictures show of which is then presses 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.230
 He just kept going on everything like that 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 like yaris and then you do 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.710
 just this internet 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.810
 connection settings if the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.510
 Internet connection is successful then 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 you just have to go back to it 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 and then just sign up or he does 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 just turn off the system 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.460
 I would guess that because it would be easy then 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 it works better then it gets better 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.220
 but I'll just now times 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.510
 it always works and now 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.520
 I can you then you just up 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.380
 I will show you the game again 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.090
 how you reverse that because 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.640
 There are probably no areas 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
 more easy again on the internet 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.200
 connection settings go - 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.960
 defines wireless and all water up 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 to the dns settings there 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 automatically and pushes everything again 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.660
 continue thanks to the connection 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.300
 succeeded and makes the test again 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.210
 if the then finished again simply the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.620
 test, you just have to do the same 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.810
 Let's go back in one fold 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.320
 and now I wait a bit until it 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.320
 is done 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:23.790
 then the system would shut down or 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:27.599
 logs in and when I turn off 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.409
 then it should work that 's it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.409
 thumbs up
