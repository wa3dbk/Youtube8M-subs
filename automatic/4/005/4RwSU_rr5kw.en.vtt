 three different colors depending on how 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.660
 The first rubber ring is just over the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.660

 herringbone pattern you always need three 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.220
 The next gumming is just over 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.900
