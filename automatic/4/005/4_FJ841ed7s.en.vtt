00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
something I've been working on so

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.070 
something I've been working on so
basically<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.390> turned<00:00:18.630> over<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
basically as I turned over here and you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.599 
basically as I turned over here and you
see<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.350> wouldn't<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.250> creative

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
see this wouldn't think I'm in creative

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
see this wouldn't think I'm in creative
mode<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:20.970> flat<00:00:21.210> fortress<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:21.750> I've<00:00:22.590> got

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
mode on this flat fortress here I've got

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
mode on this flat fortress here I've got
the<00:00:22.830> brightness<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.850> lighting<00:00:24.420> I'd

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the brightness up so this lighting I'd

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.000 
the brightness up so this lighting I'd
really<00:00:25.019> work<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> well<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
really work that well but this is just a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300 
really work that well but this is just a
simple<00:00:26.250> lighting<00:00:26.460> whether<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:28.099> stone<00:00:29.099> thing

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
simple lighting whether the stone thing

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.290 
simple lighting whether the stone thing
moves<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> way<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:29.910> i<00:00:29.939> turn<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> off

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
moves in the way when i turn it off

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
moves in the way when i turn it off
that's<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> yeah<00:00:33.800> basically<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.160> idea

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that's that so yeah basically the idea

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.270 
that's that so yeah basically the idea
of<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.860> let's<00:00:37.860> say<00:00:37.980> you're

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
of this thing here is let's say you're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
of this thing here is let's say you're
out<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> mine<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> you've<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> you've<00:00:40.050> got

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
out of mine and you've got a you've got

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
out of mine and you've got a you've got
to<00:00:40.320> bring<00:00:40.410> stuff<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> carry

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to bring stuff more than you can carry

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
to bring stuff more than you can carry
back<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.450> base<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.890> storage

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
back to your base so you have storage

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
back to your base so you have storage
cuts<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.640> thing<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.450> when<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> put<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.050> on

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cuts but thing is when you put them on

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
cuts but thing is when you put them on
one<00:00:46.230> track<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> hear<00:00:47.610> maybe

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
one track at all get to hear maybe

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
one track at all get to hear maybe
bounced<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.329> sometimes<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> pretty

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
bounced back sometimes so you pretty

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920 
bounced back sometimes so you pretty
much<00:00:49.410> screwed<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> developed

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
much screwed there so kind of developed

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.330 
much screwed there so kind of developed
away<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.289> I've<00:00:52.379> spent<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.710> few<00:00:52.829> hours<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.219> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
away and I've spent a few hours on this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
away and I've spent a few hours on this
this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.510> big<00:00:54.690> build<00:00:54.870> when

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this is actually pretty big build when

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
this is actually pretty big build when
you<00:00:55.079> seal<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> wiring<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> behind<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.629> yeah

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you seal the wiring it behind the yeah

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.849 
you seal the wiring it behind the yeah
you<00:00:57.780> may<00:00:57.930> even<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.170> two<00:00:58.320> minds<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

let's show you what happens and so
basically<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.030> come<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.570> each<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:13.200> here

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
basically all come down in each one here

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
basically all come down in each one here
on<00:01:13.770> their<00:01:13.950> own<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.310> could<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:15.119> modifications

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
on their own you could do modifications

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
on their own you could do modifications
and<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:17.450> make<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.950> three

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and make it up make it so two or three

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.030 
and make it up make it so two or three
get<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.330> how<00:01:21.479> I've<00:01:21.600> made<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
get on here but this is how I've made it

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.690 
get on here but this is how I've made it
until<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> switches<00:01:23.869> should<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.049> fine

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
until the switches should all be fine

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
until the switches should all be fine
let's<00:01:26.700> flip<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.000> switch<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
let's flip that switch and now just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.630 
let's flip that switch and now just
called<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> minecart<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
called the minecart in and as you can

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
called the minecart in and as you can
see<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.210> coming<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> bit

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
see they're all coming in they're a bit

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
see they're all coming in they're a bit
slow<00:01:31.439> because<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> delay<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.369> I'm

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
slow because it was a delay on how I'm

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
slow because it was a delay on how I'm
holding<00:01:32.729> him<00:01:33.799> are<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.009> coming

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
holding him are they all coming

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
holding him are they all coming
perfectly<00:01:35.670> fine<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.299> basically<00:01:36.960> you're

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
perfectly fine and basically you're

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
perfectly fine and basically you're
gonna<00:01:37.470> start<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> first<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.369> first<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
gonna start on the first one first so it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
gonna start on the first one first so it
doesn't<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.270> matter<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> yeah<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.920> all

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
doesn't really matter so yeah that's all

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
doesn't really matter so yeah that's all
of<00:01:41.220> them<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.729> swung<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> let's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
of them I've swung them all in and let's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.300 
of them I've swung them all in and let's
say<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.290> finished<00:01:43.439> filling<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.189> up

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
say I've finished filling this one up

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.050 
say I've finished filling this one up
with<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:45.200> rail<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> send<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> back

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
with one rail and I want to send it back

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.630 
with one rail and I want to send it back
would<00:01:48.750> come<00:01:49.020> over<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.549> how

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
would come over here and see this is how

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.980 
would come over here and see this is how
much<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.880> had<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> test<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> everything<00:01:51.659> like

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
much I had to test and everything like

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.130 
much I had to test and everything like
that<00:01:52.729> level<00:01:53.729> /<00:01:53.909> cough<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.689> you'd<00:01:54.840> flick<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
that level / cough and you'd flick that

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800 
that level / cough and you'd flick that
switch<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.090> freely<00:01:57.719> at

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
switch and then you could just freely at

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.530 
switch and then you could just freely at
your<00:01:57.930> will<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.439> send<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:58.950> off<00:01:59.299> many<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
your will just send them off many if you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.080 
your will just send them off many if you
want<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.100> works<00:02:02.310> perfectly<00:02:02.850> fine

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
want and it all works perfectly fine

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.609 
want and it all works perfectly fine
let's<00:02:03.360> run<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.079> check<00:02:04.439> when

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
let's run out there and go check when

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
let's run out there and go check when
they're<00:02:04.740> all<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.979> you'll<00:02:05.880> probably<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
they're all going you'll probably see a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.910 
they're all going you'll probably see a
ton<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> wiring<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.200> all<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.530> jump<00:02:07.770> off

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
ton of wiring and they all just jump off

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.780 
ton of wiring and they all just jump off
into<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.280> direction<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.899> that's<00:02:10.080> how<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
into one direction so that's how that is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
into one direction so that's how that is
as<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.450> little<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
as you can see this is my little this is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.690 
as you can see this is my little this is
what<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.860> wiring<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.190> everything<00:02:14.459> will<00:02:14.610> come

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
what the wiring and everything will come

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.770 
what the wiring and everything will come
on<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.910> that's<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.209> light<00:02:15.360> salmon<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
on it that's just the light salmon and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.150 
on it that's just the light salmon and
to<00:02:15.840> worry<00:02:15.989> about<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.260> giant<00:02:16.590> thing<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
to worry about that giant thing on the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.180 
to worry about that giant thing on the
top<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.930> show<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.410> how<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.830> thing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
top so let's show you how the thing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.250 
top so let's show you how the thing
works<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:21.120> doing<00:02:21.330> manual<00:02:21.660> reset<00:02:21.959> that's<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
works that's doing manual reset that's a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.350 
works that's doing manual reset that's a
reset<00:02:22.590> switch<00:02:22.739> reset<00:02:23.730> us<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.940> those<00:02:24.090> things

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
reset switch reset us to those things

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.540 
reset switch reset us to those things
anything<00:02:24.930> else<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.110> need<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> reset<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
anything else I need to reset like the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.900 
anything else I need to reset like the
light<00:02:26.700> bomb<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.860> basically<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
light bomb so basically this is the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.190 
light bomb so basically this is the
holding<00:02:30.120> area<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.420> will<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.750> miles<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
holding area this will be like miles and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.990 
holding area this will be like miles and
miles<00:02:31.380> away<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.680> it'll<00:02:32.459> take<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> while<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.910> get

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
miles away so it'll take a while to get

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.960 
miles away so it'll take a while to get
to<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.500> basically<00:02:34.860> they'll<00:02:35.400> come<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
to it and basically they'll come in and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.220 
to it and basically they'll come in and
they<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.209> get<00:02:36.330> sorted<00:02:36.569> into<00:02:36.870> their<00:02:37.110> own

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
they all get sorted into their own

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.339 
they all get sorted into their own
holding<00:02:37.739> area<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:39.019> whatever<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
holding area like whatever I like the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.940 
holding area like whatever I like the
one<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.709> kind<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.150> something<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.269> that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
one in that kind of something like that

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.690 
one in that kind of something like that
and<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:46.430> yeah<00:02:47.430> they're<00:02:47.580> all

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and like that so and yeah they're all

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.680 
and like that so and yeah they're all
being<00:02:47.850> held<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.269> there<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.540> everything

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
being held in there and everything

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.990 
being held in there and everything
properly<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.980> basically<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.760> we

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
properly and basically what we do is we

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.559 
properly and basically what we do is we
send<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.269> signal<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.600> ask<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.569> that

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
send a signal to ask for them and that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
send a signal to ask for them and that
will<00:02:57.840> convert<00:02:58.709> all<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.099> I've<00:02:59.250> got<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
will convert all of this I've got a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.309 
will convert all of this I've got a
manual<00:02:59.670> switch<00:02:59.849> their<00:03:00.030> cool<00:03:00.299> instrument<00:03:01.260> I'm

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
manual switch their cool instrument I'm

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.370 
manual switch their cool instrument I'm
testing<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.920> hole<00:03:02.280> there<00:03:03.019> what<00:03:04.019> happens<00:03:04.260> is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
testing that hole there what happens is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.589 
testing that hole there what happens is
as<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.010> over<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.580> pressured<00:03:06.330> rail

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
as you go over the the pressured rail

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.490 
as you go over the the pressured rail
tracks<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.680> forget<00:03:08.280> what<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.489> called<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:10.380> I'll

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
tracks I forget what they called so I'll

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.850 
tracks I forget what they called so I'll
just<00:03:10.530> detect<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> rails<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.930> flicks<00:03:13.470> an<00:03:13.590> RS

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
just detect the rails it flicks an RS

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.580 
just detect the rails it flicks an RS
nor<00:03:14.130> vertical<00:03:14.819> one<00:03:14.970> down<00:03:15.540> below<00:03:15.750> which<00:03:15.959> these

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.099 
have been modified like a man to be
wider<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.299> everything<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.930> hits

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
wider and everything like that it hits

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.599 
wider and everything like that it hits
out<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> flicks<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> then

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
out and it flicks that on and then

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.539 
out and it flicks that on and then
changes<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.530> then<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.890> flicks<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
changes this and then that flicks the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.180 
changes this and then that flicks the
actual<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.840> rail<00:03:24.989> there<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.040> change

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
actual the rail there and to change

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.229 
actual the rail there and to change
directions<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.730> come<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> next<00:03:27.180> one

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
directions to come on to the next one

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.390 
directions to come on to the next one
the<00:03:27.480> last<00:03:27.600> one<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:27.900> resets<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the last one just resets all that so

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.620 
the last one just resets all that so
technically<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.819> could<00:03:29.940> keep<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.510> on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
technically you could keep on going on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.729 
technically you could keep on going on
if<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.049> but<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.290> kind<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.440> gets<00:03:31.530> been

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
if you want to but it kind of gets been

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.710 
if you want to but it kind of gets been
stopped<00:03:32.040> over<00:03:32.280> here<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.670> course<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.630> make

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
stopped over here of course you can make

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.360 
stopped over here of course you can make
modifications<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:35.069> keep<00:03:35.220> on

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
modifications and you can keep on

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.650 
modifications and you can keep on
extending<00:03:35.579> on<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.209> wanted<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.540> and

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
extending on this if you wanted to and

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.380 
extending on this if you wanted to and
you<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.870> had<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.079> extend<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:39.269> yeah

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you just had to extend that so yeah

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.660 
you just had to extend that so yeah
basically<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.989> then<00:03:40.079> we've<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.200> our<00:03:40.609> send<00:03:41.609> a

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
basically and then we've got our send a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.069 
basically and then we've got our send a
back<00:03:41.790> button<00:03:42.060> which<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.450> locks<00:03:42.660> these<00:03:42.870> so

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
back button which is the locks these so

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.140 
back button which is the locks these so
they<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.769> RS<00:03:44.010> nor<00:03:44.130> latch<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.459> don't<00:03:44.700> actually

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
they the RS nor latch is don't actually

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.879 
they the RS nor latch is don't actually
get<00:03:45.389> flipped<00:03:47.720> locks<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.930> comes<00:03:49.380> through<00:03:49.680> here

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
get flipped locks it comes through here

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.559 
get flipped locks it comes through here
and<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.100> lock<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.459> thing<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.269> how<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
and just lock this thing this is how it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.440 
and just lock this thing this is how it
is<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.579> flicks<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> rails<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
is and then it just flicks the rails the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.750 
is and then it just flicks the rails the
certain<00:03:54.750> way<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.019> we're<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:56.010> send<00:03:56.519> these

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
certain way so we're going to send these

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.830 
certain way so we're going to send these
ones<00:03:56.970> off<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.269> can<00:03:57.329> see<00:03:57.510> how<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.720> works

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
ones off and you can see how it works

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.050 
ones off and you can see how it works
now<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:58.980> flicked<00:03:59.370> all<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.609> these<00:03:59.760> and<00:03:59.940> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
now it just flicked all of these and it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.910 
now it just flicked all of these and it
does<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.600> time<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.139> it's<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> bit<00:04:01.620> delay

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
does it on a time so it's a bit delay

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.949 
does it on a time so it's a bit delay
that's<00:04:02.549> because<00:04:02.970> they<00:04:03.359> kept<00:04:03.540> on<00:04:03.600> hitting<00:04:03.750> each

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that's because they kept on hitting each

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.059 
that's because they kept on hitting each
other<00:04:04.019> when<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.290> was<00:04:04.380> testing<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.709> out<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:04.950> all

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
other when I was testing it out they all

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.900 
other when I was testing it out they all
just<00:04:05.190> running<00:04:06.060> through<00:04:06.090> there<00:04:07.489> only<00:04:08.489> 12<00:04:08.700> more

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
just running through there only 12 more

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.710 
just running through there only 12 more
and<00:04:09.859> that's<00:04:10.859> all<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.310> last<00:04:11.489> one<00:04:11.700> resets<00:04:12.450> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and that's all the last one resets it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.949 
and that's all the last one resets it
and<00:04:12.870> everything<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.880> yeah<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.780> basically

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
and everything and yeah so basically

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.039 
and everything and yeah so basically
what<00:04:16.289> happens<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.799> that's<00:04:17.280> already<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.870> could

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
what happens is that's already you could

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.589 
what happens is that's already you could
come<00:04:19.260> by<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.440> go<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.479> whoa<00:04:22.190> wrong<00:04:23.190> one

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
come by and go like this whoa wrong one

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.640 
come by and go like this whoa wrong one
like<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:24.870> if<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.140> want<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> because<00:04:25.560> it

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
like that and if you want to because it

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.890 
like that and if you want to because it
comes<00:04:25.770> out<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.979> same<00:04:26.010> way<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:26.280> basically

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
comes out the same way but basically

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.140 
comes out the same way but basically
we'll<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:29.050> flip<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.259> switch<00:04:29.350> there<00:04:30.000> we<00:04:31.000> go

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
we'll just flip this switch there we go

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.520 
we'll just flip this switch there we go
and<00:04:31.419> then<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:31.750> flicks<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.169> way<00:04:32.290> neural

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
and then this flicks that way neural

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.439 
and then this flicks that way neural
they<00:04:32.800> all<00:04:32.979> will<00:04:33.460> come<00:04:33.490> down<00:04:33.850> off<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.150> track

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
they all will come down off this track

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.870 
they all will come down off this track
here<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:36.130> not<00:04:36.220> too<00:04:36.340> many<00:04:36.490> ways<00:04:36.639> I<00:04:36.759> can

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
here it's not too many ways I can

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.800 
here it's not too many ways I can
actually<00:04:37.090> show<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.570> but<00:04:38.199> I<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:40.630> show

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
actually show you that but I can show

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.560 
actually show you that but I can show
you<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:41.050> how<00:04:41.440> we<00:04:41.500> good<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:43.270> don't<00:04:43.419> need<00:04:43.509> to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
you that how we good you don't need to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.040 
you that how we good you don't need to
know<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.990> what<00:04:44.590> am<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.740> thinking<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.750> yeah<00:04:46.870> we

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
know that what am I thinking so yeah we

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.779 
know that what am I thinking so yeah we
switched<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.440> one<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:49.000> we<00:04:49.090> can<00:04:49.240> send<00:04:49.449> off<00:04:49.600> to

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
switched that one and we can send off to

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.490 
switched that one and we can send off to
life<00:04:51.789> didn't<00:04:52.210> sprint<00:04:52.449> there<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.870> then<00:04:53.020> she'd

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
life didn't sprint there and then she'd

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.960 
life didn't sprint there and then she'd
see<00:04:53.650> they're<00:04:53.800> all<00:04:53.919> running<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.759> edge

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
see they're all running off the edge

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.300 
see they're all running off the edge
over<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.570> there<00:04:56.789> like<00:04:57.789> that<00:04:58.449> and<00:04:59.130> yeah<00:05:00.130> that's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
over to there like that and yeah that's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.650 
over to there like that and yeah that's
how<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.669> works<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.800> yeah<00:05:03.090> that's<00:05:04.090> what<00:05:04.630> I

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660
