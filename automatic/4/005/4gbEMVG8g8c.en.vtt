three<00:03:33.360> thunderstorms<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:35.459> had<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.970> move<00:03:36.629> a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
three thunderstorms and I had to move a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.149 
three thunderstorms and I had to move a
tree<00:03:37.110> out<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.409> road<00:03:37.560> everyone<00:03:38.040> just

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
tree out of the road everyone just

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.100 
tree out of the road everyone just
stopped<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.420> guess<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:39.870> were<00:03:39.930> waiting

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
stopped and I guess they were waiting

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.930

for<00:03:40.319> someone<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.890> move<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.220> tree<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> guess

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
for someone to move the tree so I guess

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.839
