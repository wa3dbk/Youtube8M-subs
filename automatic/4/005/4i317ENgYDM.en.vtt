00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.870 

ultraflex<00:00:20.810> technology<00:00:21.800> is<00:00:22.040> our<00:00:22.220> latest<00:00:22.430> in

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
ultraflex technology is our latest in

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.089 
ultraflex technology is our latest in
our<00:00:23.300> series<00:00:23.360> of<00:00:23.779> technologies<00:00:24.650> that<00:00:24.919> we've

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
our series of technologies that we've

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.190 
our series of technologies that we've
developed<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:26.029> differentiates<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:27.169> from

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
developed what differentiates it from

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.229 
developed what differentiates it from
what<00:00:27.650> we've<00:00:27.829> had<00:00:28.040> in<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.279> past<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.880> fact

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
what we've had in the past is the fact

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.109 
what we've had in the past is the fact
that<00:00:29.419> it's<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.779> machine<00:00:29.960> driven<00:00:30.470> technology

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
that it's a machine driven technology

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.090 
that it's a machine driven technology
meaning<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.450> each<00:00:32.840> one<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.140> these<00:00:33.350> designs

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
meaning that each one of these designs

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.270 
meaning that each one of these designs
is<00:00:34.640> from<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> scanned<00:00:35.870> original<00:00:36.710> shape<00:00:36.980> and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
is from a scanned original shape and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.610 
is from a scanned original shape and
then<00:00:37.789> produced<00:00:38.210> on<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.480> shaping<00:00:39.019> machine<00:00:39.350> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
then produced on a shaping machine and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:54.520 
then produced on a shaping machine and
then<00:00:40.010> fine<00:00:40.430> tune<00:00:40.460> by<00:00:41.120> hand<00:00:53.350> certainly<00:00:54.350> it's

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
then fine tune by hand certainly it's

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.750 
then fine tune by hand certainly it's
following<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> trend<00:00:55.429> that's<00:00:55.550> happening

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
following the trend that's happening

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.479 
following the trend that's happening
right<00:00:56.269> now<00:00:56.329> I've<00:00:57.230> done<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.589> shape<00:00:57.890> it's

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
right now I've done this shape it's

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.239 
right now I've done this shape it's
called<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.820> skater<00:00:59.120> if<00:00:59.929> it's<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.649> shorter<00:01:01.039> bar

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
called the skater if it's a shorter bar

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.229 
called the skater if it's a shorter bar
that<00:01:01.550> comes<00:01:01.969> in<00:01:02.120> 5<00:01:02.359> 8<00:01:02.629> 5<00:01:03.019> 10<00:01:03.499> it's<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.460> wider

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
that comes in 5 8 5 10 it's a wider

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.080 
that comes in 5 8 5 10 it's a wider

concave running into a double barrel and
this<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.000> for<00:01:14.150> just<00:01:14.390> going<00:01:14.660> out<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.500> small

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is for just going out in small

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.469 

this<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.000> what<00:01:46.180> people<00:01:46.390> were<00:01:46.720> using<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:49.270> is

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
this is what people were using this is

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.200 
this is what people were using this is
what<00:01:49.630> we're<00:01:49.780> using<00:01:49.960> now<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.610> what<00:01:51.850> glass

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
what we're using now this is what glass

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.990 
what we're using now this is what glass
unique<00:01:52.990> thing<00:01:53.200> about<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.800> stitch<00:01:54.280> work<00:01:54.310> glass

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
unique thing about a stitch work glass

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.390 
unique thing about a stitch work glass
is<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> hundred<00:01:56.350> percent<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.950> fibers

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
is that a hundred percent of the fibers

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.450 
is that a hundred percent of the fibers
go<00:01:57.670> into<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.970> performance<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.840> surfboard

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
go into the performance of the surfboard

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.820 
go into the performance of the surfboard
the<00:02:00.460> fibers<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.119> crisscrossed<00:02:01.930> at<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.320> 45

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
the fibers are crisscrossed at a 45

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.010 
the fibers are crisscrossed at a 45
degree<00:02:02.860> angle<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:04.390> stitched<00:02:04.750> together

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
degree angle and then stitched together

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.950 
degree angle and then stitched together
and<00:02:05.560> what<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.369> does<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:06.910> allows<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
and what this does is this allows the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.800 
and what this does is this allows the
board<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.350> flex<00:02:08.800> soft<00:02:09.459> off<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:10.000> bottom<00:02:10.390> give

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
board to flex soft off the bottom give

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.990 
board to flex soft off the bottom give

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you a good field yet when you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.540 
you a good field yet when you
torsionally<00:02:13.660> load<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> bottom<00:02:15.040> turn<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
torsionally load it on a bottom turn it
