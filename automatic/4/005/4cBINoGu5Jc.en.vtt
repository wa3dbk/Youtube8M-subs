00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 and let me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.799
 leave me empty 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 then this crisis has already lost only 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.020
 to walk 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:32.439
 I sang covers of themes from 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.060
 foreigners and people went crazy 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:40.070
 I sang songs of Sant Stereo sang 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.070
 to black eyed peas themes with my language 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.230
 and one day grab and sing in your place 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.399
 pancho 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.399
 and the whole world I sing 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.640
 after I started to try with each one 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.990
 of the subjects and everyone sang 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.650
 so I said here is a story that 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.650
 you have to rescue 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.550
 I consider myself a family type a type 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.990
 affectionate 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.900
 and at the same time a very stubborn guy 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.810
 I have my temperament but I recognize it 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.810
 and when I have to be an apprentice 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.670
 to dance 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 returns the waist because it is with art 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.240
 assured he gets up with a joint leg 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.960
 because the track is already going to start and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.220
 whenever I was 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.270
 bands I loved to contribute I loved it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.820
 this 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.550
 and be able to leave ideas that leave 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.290
 precedents then there comes a moment in 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.460
 that I said good now from the moment of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.710
 take a step 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.490
 and will start from arm with what I 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.490
 I can create 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.160
 like soccer probably that's my 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.640
 second life 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.680
 to bicycles and motorcycles I think it's 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.739
 well what what allows me 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.439
 leave the music if it is that when 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.560
 when I 'm not with her I go behind 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:34.329
 what people do not dare to say 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 what people are good or bad 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.590
 I think that is what inspires me and 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:45.109
 what what makes my head can 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.950
 create sounds and lyrics I was born in latacunga 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.410
 and I grew up in quito I am 50% will collide and 50% 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.170
 Blog 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 has already considered the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.820
 final my mother took me out to play in a 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.590
 scenario when I was four years old 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.340
 later when I was six I started to play 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.500
 Guitar 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.620
 later when I was 11 I started to play 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.770
 the battery later when I was 16 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.190
 I started playing percussion and then 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.739
 I started playing something bass and always 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.130
 I do not remember a single moment that I do not remember 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.130
 I have sung 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.350
 do not 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.470
 is a history of music from Ecuador that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.780
 never before was created 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.930
 in each story each song has 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.140
 one meaning and each author has a 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.910
 expression and I can tell you that all 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.860
 those who are inside this tribute and 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.640
 all the songs that go there that 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.290
 now you will feel like mine 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.100
 that are really yours I know that the 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.650
 music 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.680
 the music is stronger than any 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.930
 thing and what one believes and what one 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 feels when he does it non-stop 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.139
 fernando pacheco yes no 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.120
 his intervention in live ecuador that 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:35.389
 it seemed nuanced the presentation phenomena 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:47.110
 of the amazing tower and the best thing is the 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:47.110
 feeling that I am Ecuadorian that is
