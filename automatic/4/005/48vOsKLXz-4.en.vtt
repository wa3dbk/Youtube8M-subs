00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hi everyone, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.509
 who makes an applique to see the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 character pepa you this model 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.880
 here you are doing and apply it to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
 see us we will be using a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 scissors 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.410
 the stylus which are the two instruments 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.410
 cutting 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.920
 the pens of preference is the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.840
 retro projector pen nick clegg 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.649
 permanent 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 you have the option of using the hot glue 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 the instant adhesive I prefer 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.510
 working with liquid silicone is fine 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:01.020
 to see the pair with the generous amount 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:02.760
 and end the risk of breaking 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 Like hot cola for those who do not have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 I like to stir with hot glue so we 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.790
 we will also need 33 tones 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.680
 of a day to win will be a more tone 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.200
 pink and pink or softer pink more 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 clear and white to do the part 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.710
 of the eye 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.650
 so we'll be doing the following 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 first thing you will vote for 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 It's betting on you. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 kite mold is always liked mini 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.579
 and the first thing to do is to be 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 making the cut so you can 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.759
 taking a mold is cut off part by 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 part of the papupa school so let's do 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:01.130
 the next you cut first part of 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.130
 It's out even the two finishes 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.640
 lighter honorable darker pink 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.900
 superimposed first you cut this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:21.859
 part is outside then the inner part 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:24.769
 today both the following you pick up the mold 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:28.219
 I have made here to facilitate and cut 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.340
 make a cut the cut identified 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:37.310
 today an order from outside 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:42.109
 then you come with the template overlaps not 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:46.159
 It's to travel, I cut it and make 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:51.349
 marking with the barbecue stick 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:53.659
 remembering that you can not be indicated 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.060
 do not use pen that writes 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.930
 No, it's a landmark and it's a job. 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.959
 very ugly one gives a nice finish 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.989
 soon I scored 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.669
 there you can cut with the fill 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:26.359
 or with the scissors 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:29.329
 You will make a cut of what you 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 It 's the part that I cut here that happens 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:38.780
 if you make an equal cut I did it here 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.699
 including the part of the little face along with 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.430
 You just want to know that I went alone. 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.549
 separated from that part of the face 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.849
 so what are you going to do? 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.569
 This separation you cut here is 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:58.340
 part here right now and at the time of 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.859
 paste already overlaps in a little taste of pt 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.449
 Or you do just like me. 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.169
 thus preferred to make the cut and cutting 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 like this 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:12.799
 I'll do it then, then. 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:15.609
 to ride you take the first part to 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.609
 outside 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:31.970
 in the second part that's what I ended up 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:35.990
 cutter will fit the shape better. 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.300
 shape this silicone glue it takes 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.680
 a little more to dry but it's a lot 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.170
 easier to work even 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.820
 people who do not have the habit of working 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.620
 with the craftsmanship is very practical will 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.570
 take a little bit more with quantity 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.080
 generous put a little too much 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:58.900
 It also ends up not gluing then the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.410
 first part I looked at it from the outside 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.410
 inside part 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.630
 I'll paste the fucking I 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:18.530
 made 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:20.090
 I marked it with the very easy 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.900
 do 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.790
 the price is also the record if it goes 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.730
 making a summary of all the 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.040
 spaces the stock market is cutting part by 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.970
 party will probably have to do or 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:40.280
 the printing of more than one mold for 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.850
 Can you do that weight record? 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.570
 by weight 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.570
 I like to make crafts 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.560
 really relax or have a bit of 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.960
 even patience 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:06.770
 so it is that the linen made use of 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:13.730
 balls in the inner part of the eye is 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:17.710
 very easy very easy even by 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:21.380
 to get to now we have then 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.510
 when we get on the cheek had knots 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.730
 Let's get the blood to do and taste. 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:30.610
 50 cent coin that you can make 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.610
 cool what the 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.940
 there you get the inside of the 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:07:07.470
 little ear 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:07:07.470
 the appliance has to glue this part of the time 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.530
 just repeating is not my facebook requires 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:26.490
 crafts will be on his page will 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:26.490
 It's my best, I'll put the 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.550
 agent until the next 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.550
 thank you very much
