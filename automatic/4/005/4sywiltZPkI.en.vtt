00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:09.430
 now I restrained myself in this video tutorial 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:11.810
 would teach how to download the new side 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.379
 ps good 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.980
 for that the first thing you have to do 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.560
 is to download this torrent file in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.860
 broadcast of the video serves for author or 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 bittorrent political forgiveness not what 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.820
 have to do is drag it to your 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.820
 torrent or bittorrent 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.000
 although yes 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 I canceled it because I already have it die 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 after it has been downloaded they go to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.030

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.130
 take the first file at first 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.310
 The music file actually existed was 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.310

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.940

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.290
 it is already ending I have 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.290
 you have to have the best picture 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.960
 and once it's extracted to get to 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.960

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.640
 our solid truth 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.640
 once emulator output like this 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.759
