00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.850
 This section is where I will answer your questions. 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.180
 But 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.390
 I will immediately read that question 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.690
 Saitama 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.380
 It is bargain 3 by set now 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.380
 Their individuality is the question of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.740
 [Laughing] 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.640
 kr There is an animation work, but a shop 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.600
 The picture is like that says that Gundam in the scene such as skiing 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:00.310
 this 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:04.050
 It looks like this test , I was born in 1963 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:10.840
 In fact this is 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:13.560
 Kedomo the Tteyuu 1963 At the time, I know this era When told television version month 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:22.920
 It's a TV cartoon MaruHajime 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.820
 The same as my growth, so I say that the nickname came in that anime came 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.640
 The 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.740
 I do not feel like that 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.500
 To Hanari 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.890
 [musics] 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.740
 I've seen it so far 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 I've seen quite 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.400
 Well that 's something I can't think of now 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.570
 Splashes of say around the time Tente saw for the first time Anomaa animation 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.360
 It was all a great work 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.200
 You can see white 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.780
 It's not a color 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 There is the Tteyuu Well animation of color 's not that black-and-white 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.619
 At that time, I still remember that, but 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.569
 That No I of it had been saying every week if there is a work called cyborg 00 yen 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.900
 That of Lord Black version 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.250
 It I was a TV animation work in the 1960s 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.090
 Well 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.599
 this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.340
 I remember clearly now 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.459
 so 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.769
 I guess that I remember a little bit 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.980
 It does not mean that everything is remembered, but if that is the reason I only sleep for that one episode 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.040
 I already remember one more of them 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 What kind of content is this? 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.240
 In war 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.700
 That worm 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.880
 Nakano 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.480
 I enjoyed it 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.080
 The scientist's father 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.080
 How many columns 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.210
 a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.500
 Of the Japanese army who lost in the war 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:05.490
 Tteyuu to review and revive the Toka fighter Toka ship 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 It was that kind of content, right? 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.760
 Also it's such Toka I kindergarten at that time 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.810
 I remember vividly in the Mima 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.510
 Something 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.420
 Maybe if you look at it now maybe it's up to here like this line 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.920
 Maybe remember 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:31.150
 With such animation work 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.340
 Iyane-That is quite intense Ippei to that childhood 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.700
 like 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.950
 It was such a content, but the wave 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:48.450
 Do not say I've lost my son to take losing a war 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.560
 That's right, I guess it was a little bit darker, but I guess it 's just war 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.900
 I still 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.890
 By'm era that was still left in the hearts of the people 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.569
 I remember in the early morning and is quite of or so strange 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.910
