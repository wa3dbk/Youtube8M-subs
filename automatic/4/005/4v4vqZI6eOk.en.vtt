00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.600
 the first thing I think 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.100
 important to turn improvised on a 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.090
 grid is to know the theme 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.039
 parker in any case to know from where so 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.210
 offers bye bye blackbird to this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.210
 first measure france too 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 1 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.110
 So, once we've seen the theme 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.309
 tale is the toy whose ideal 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.820
 actually it's to know by 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.440
 heart or possibly the bed 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.700
 the antibody the day is really 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.490
 important do not hit an improvisation 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 sense before game at least several times 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670
 the hotel 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.860
 and then we analyze the theme on 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 look at the melody we look at the notes 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:35.300
 which make up the theme so here we have six 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.260
 of water the only and sharpest F in any case 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.260
 are the first eight measures 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.010
 at 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.470
 so already having these notes in 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.630
 head makes that we will be able to improvise 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.890
 we are sure we can be mobile with these 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.430
 notes because they are part of the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.360
 time so for example when we look 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.860
 ducal first steps with which 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.350
 we have like our dole to essen well 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:32.380
 we will be able to improvise on these four 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:34.150
 notes for example where you will see that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.920
 if you play his notes with 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 the accompaniment of times it will ring 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.790
 very well and sometimes it'll rub a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.290
 little bit but for now in everything 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.130
 case taken to the sketch of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.590
 improvisation 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.080
 the first thing to do is that it's 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.510
 even apart from completely there you 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.340
 have noticed I have no accompaniment 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.130
 with me genius and contrabass monique 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.980
 anonymous is very rich all i want everything 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.810
 to simply integrate the theme is to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.790
 find variations of the term 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.670
 variations of the cac it means I take 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.200
 Using the theme and I play in a 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.700
 different order by completely at 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.500
 chance I try to make sure that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.610
 rest of playful so there prices 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.700
 example are the first four 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.500
 measures and if I take the example on 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.620
 the following four measures have 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.950
 soils the only fabienne a like I'm going 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.840
 try to take his notes and 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.200
 turn around to propose something 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200
 mythical 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:40.570
 for example or aaa 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.650
 this is the first eight days in 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:48.510
 able to do once the theme is 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.510
 then a change in the teil 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.190
 Oh 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.099
 it's the theme and variations 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.099
 I propose 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.590
 so here I actually used 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.400
 theme notes and toys in a 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.920
 different order trying to do in 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.930
 so that sounds that it's really the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.820
 first stage 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.210
 when we approach an improvisation so 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.740
 if we do the same thing on the eight 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.630
 following measures 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.630
 so I join the theme of souls 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.889
 so do water d if the sum quite the same 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.870
 I will consider these notes and I will 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.690
 were playing in a different order so that 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.690
 it remains musical so for example
