00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.949

 apparently young I did not first 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 higuain but it is true that we must 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.500
 put his head on it is the one who loses 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 a man that paris no it's in Paris 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.650
 evoked a little rebellious to nice 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.790

 I do not greet you either you shut up and 3 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 game but because the translation of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.299
 jojo was doing the really cuckolds 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 actually with digs and 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 stripped to the quench of kds 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.009
 handy chérèque balance but dude 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.430
 question mesalles launched the spear on 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.220
 square 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 auxerre launched it then on the spot at the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850
 actually leaves 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.540
 we take all - 5 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 I am a guy to me I am enormously 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 kind of thing for masseube at this end 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 it does not say do you do that for 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.300
 kingdom arrives lifeless the good good good 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 good test of agreement tests of which 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.370
 ability to be to be in fashion is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 enough in so a fairly qualitative game in 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.550
 it's too strong 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.620
 so we're going to kiss couples who 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.640
 kiss a game for singles 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 angry you have the music what 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.210
 ok you are ready to all indicated with 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
 the game well in the mood one here 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.780
 you will make people kiss you 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.330
 Okay, that's the real music of the game 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.020
 a tale to that we're going to watch the oca 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.980
 it's very ugly it's very very ugly 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.140
 so a blowgun that throws 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.070
 pebbles pebbles so if you have 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.070
 sabers can try to make 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.160
 How do you feel about it? 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.210
 it touched the guy but grenades 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.130
 in his mouth his father to exactly 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.480
 exactly to my children 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.590
 of today are formidable wanting 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.330
 give a little bit of a little bit of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.160
 weights and hop they're having fun all the 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.930
 day they put grenades in 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000
 bouncing balls and they shoot 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.800
 on parrots it's so cute 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.489
 sponge so I think that one can 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.170
 change his finery to one notices this 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.489
 way there this melody that makes us 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.750
 pleasure to the ears every time 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.030
 change an accessory 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.280
 but his ball in the water 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.280
 in his hood and this
