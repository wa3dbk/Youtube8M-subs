00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
overwhelmed with work and I have to go

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.690 
overwhelmed with work and I have to go
out<00:06:17.840> some<00:06:18.200> days<00:06:18.410> and<00:06:18.650> just<00:06:18.800> go<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.980> work<00:06:19.070> after

out some days and just go to work after
school<00:06:19.880> and<00:06:20.300> whatever<00:06:20.450> but<00:06:21.170> I<00:06:21.230> would<00:06:21.500> say<00:06:21.680> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
school and whatever but I would say the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.360 
school and whatever but I would say the
biggest<00:06:22.100> tip<00:06:22.730> is<00:06:23.230> staying<00:06:24.230> organized<00:06:25.070> in

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
biggest tip is staying organized in

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.180 
biggest tip is staying organized in
school<00:06:25.970> because<00:06:26.960> the<00:06:27.170> more<00:06:27.410> work<00:06:27.740> that<00:06:28.040> you

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
school because the more work that you

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.250 
school because the more work that you
get<00:06:28.370> done<00:06:28.610> in<00:06:28.880> school<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:29.720> less<00:06:29.960> work<00:06:30.230> you

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
get done in school the less work you

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.770 
get done in school the less work you
have<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.830> do<00:06:31.310> outside<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:32.000> school<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.690> the

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
have to do outside of school and the

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.810 
have to do outside of school and the
more<00:06:32.960> time<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:33.500> can<00:06:33.650> spend<00:06:33.860> with<00:06:34.160> your<00:06:34.520> horses

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
more time you can spend with your horses

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.490 
more time you can spend with your horses
and<00:06:35.120> at<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.450> stables<00:06:35.900> training<00:06:36.380> and
