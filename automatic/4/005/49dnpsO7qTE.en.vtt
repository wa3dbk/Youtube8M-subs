00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
Pablo Francisco a lot because he did

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.680 
Pablo Francisco a lot because he did
voices<00:01:00.500> too<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.310> I<00:01:01.580> watched<00:01:02.060> too<00:01:02.330> much<00:01:02.450> of

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
voices too and I I watched too much of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.910 
voices too and I I watched too much of
him<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:02.990> that<00:01:03.170> kind<00:01:03.380> of<00:01:03.440> effects<00:01:03.740> in<00:01:03.860> my

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
him and that kind of effects in my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.800 
him and that kind of effects in my
comedy<00:01:04.250> but<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.460> didn't<00:01:04.699> matter<00:01:04.820> because<00:01:04.940> when

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
comedy but it didn't matter because when

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.120 
comedy but it didn't matter because when
you<00:01:05.870> start<00:01:06.110> out<00:01:06.260> stand-up<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:06.830> there's

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you start out stand-up you there's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.440 
you start out stand-up you there's
always<00:01:07.310> someone<00:01:07.550> you<00:01:07.670> look<00:01:07.790> up<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:08.240> didn't

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
always someone you look up to so didn't

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.219 
always someone you look up to so didn't
really<00:01:08.510> matter<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:10.390> I'd<00:01:11.390> say<00:01:11.600> people<00:01:12.080> that

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
really matter but I'd say people that

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.050 
really matter but I'd say people that
inspire<00:01:12.560> me<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.740> lot<00:01:12.950> though<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.160> think<00:01:13.850> Maria

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it and then I was I was like oh wow

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720 
it and then I was I was like oh wow
that's<00:03:00.500> pretty<00:03:00.650> good<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.130> really<00:03:01.250> proud<00:03:01.670> of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that's pretty good I was really proud of

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.600 
that's pretty good I was really proud of
myself<00:03:01.850> after<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.079> moment<00:03:03.500> live<00:03:04.160> when<00:03:04.579> I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
myself after but the moment live when I

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.300 
myself after but the moment live when I
experienced<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.269> was<00:03:05.799> probably<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:07.100> best

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
experienced that was probably the best

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.170 
experienced that was probably the best
moment<00:03:07.730> ever

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
moment ever

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:27.210 
moment ever
it<00:03:08.630> was<00:03:08.750> very<00:03:08.959> very<00:03:09.739> cool

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.640 

it's<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> think<00:03:29.060> any<00:03:29.390> person<00:03:29.810> needs<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.560> make

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
it's so I think any person needs to make

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.860 
it's so I think any person needs to make
sure<00:03:30.799> there's<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.030> they're<00:03:32.209> doing<00:03:32.480> something

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
sure there's if they're doing something

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.360 
sure there's if they're doing something
on<00:03:32.959> their<00:03:33.080> free<00:03:33.260> time<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.500> they<00:03:33.830> love<00:03:34.129> and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
on their free time that they love and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
on their free time that they love and
they<00:03:34.870> they<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:36.049> enjoy<00:03:36.409> and<00:03:36.739> just<00:03:37.390> follow

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
they they just enjoy and just follow

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.449 
they they just enjoy and just follow
your<00:03:38.840> dreams<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.650> think<00:03:39.980> that's<00:03:40.129> really

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
your dreams and I think that's really
