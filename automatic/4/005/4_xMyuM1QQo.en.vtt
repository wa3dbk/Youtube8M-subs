goes<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.300> minim<00:00:33.660> OSD<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> did<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
goes to my minim OSD but what I did is I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090 
goes to my minim OSD but what I did is I
clip<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.960> had<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> leads<00:00:37.649> free

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
clip this off so I had the leads free

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340 
clip this off so I had the leads free
that<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> could<00:00:39.210> wire<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> Bluetooth

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that I could wire up to the Bluetooth

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950 
that I could wire up to the Bluetooth
module<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.100> four<00:00:41.309> pins<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.760> used<00:00:42.090> coming

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
module there are four pins I used coming

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
rx pins four and five are not used so

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.959 
rx pins four and five are not used so
you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> flying<00:00:59.370> leads<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> I'll

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you can see the flying leads and I'll

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
you can see the flying leads and I'll
probably<00:01:00.149> clip<00:01:00.510> those<00:01:00.750> off<00:01:00.780> later<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.649> from

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
probably clip those off later on from

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.469 
probably clip those off later on from
the<00:01:02.789> 3dr<00:01:03.090> radio<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.409> red<00:01:04.619> BCC

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
the 3dr radio I have the red BCC

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.600 
the 3dr radio I have the red BCC
connected<00:01:06.479> that's<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> 5<00:01:07.080> volts<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.460> have

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
connected that's the 5 volts then I have

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
connected that's the 5 volts then I have
ground<00:01:09.229> connected<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> originally<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
ground connected and originally I have

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
ground connected and originally I have
this<00:01:11.820> wired<00:01:12.060> backwards<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.320> tricky<00:01:14.130> thing

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this wired backwards so a tricky thing

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
this wired backwards so a tricky thing
about<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:15.509> setup<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> something<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
about this setup and something to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
about this setup and something to
remember<00:01:16.590> since<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> bluetooth<00:01:17.610> module

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
remember since this bluetooth module

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.660 
remember since this bluetooth module
serves<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> bridge<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.220> TX

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
serves as a bridge you actually want TX

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.630 
serves as a bridge you actually want TX
coming<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.840> 3dr<00:01:22.110> radio<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
coming from your 3dr radio to go to the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.170 
coming from your 3dr radio to go to the
TX<00:01:24.000> pin<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.950> Rx<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> radio<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
TX pin and Rx from the radio to go to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
TX pin and Rx from the radio to go to
the<00:01:27.299> RX<00:01:27.689> pin<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the RX pin so it's kind of a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
the RX pin so it's kind of a
pass-through<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> other<00:01:30.479> end<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
pass-through and on the other end the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
pass-through and on the other end the
Samsung<00:01:31.290> Galaxy<00:01:31.439> will<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.070> talking<00:01:32.570> via

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
Samsung Galaxy will be talking via

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
Samsung Galaxy will be talking via
bluetooth<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.579> module<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.590> only

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
bluetooth to this module and the only

bluetooth to this module and the only
other<00:01:37.979> connections<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.270> need<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> worry

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
other connections that we need to worry

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
other connections that we need to worry
about<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.259> getting<00:01:40.979> power<00:01:41.189> both<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> the

milliamp lipo laying around you could

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.540 
milliamp lipo laying around you could
definitely<00:02:38.350> get<00:02:38.590> away<00:02:38.800> with<00:02:38.950> something<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.370> lot

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
definitely get away with something a lot

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.360 
definitely get away with something a lot
smaller<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.740> now<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.130> what<00:02:42.280> I'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
smaller but for now that's what I'm

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.830 
smaller but for now that's what I'm
going<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.550> use<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.180> demonstrate<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
going to use just to demonstrate the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.120 
going to use just to demonstrate the
setup<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> take<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.940> lipo<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
setup I'm going to take the lipo and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.100 
setup I'm going to take the lipo and
connect<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.280> jst<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.390> should<00:02:49.600> see<00:02:49.750> power<00:02:49.990> to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
connect this jst we should see power to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.900 
connect this jst we should see power to
both<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> bluetooth<00:02:50.800> module<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.610> 3dr

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
both the bluetooth module and the 3dr

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.300 
both the bluetooth module and the 3dr
radio<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.780> everything<00:02:56.170> looks<00:02:56.380> good<00:02:56.590> there<00:02:56.650> now

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
radio so everything looks good there now

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.590 
radio so everything looks good there now
one<00:02:57.520> thing<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.730> want<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.910> point<00:02:58.030> out<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:58.240> did

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
one thing I want to point out I did

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.900 
one thing I want to point out I did
direct<00:02:58.990> solder<00:02:59.260> these<00:02:59.530> leads<00:02:59.860> not<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
direct solder these leads not the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.450 
direct solder these leads not the
cleanest<00:03:01.360> solution<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
cleanest solution but you know this is a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060 
cleanest solution but you know this is a
prototype<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.450> maybe<00:03:05.230> I'll<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> follow<00:03:05.920> up

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
prototype so maybe I'll do a follow up

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.090 
prototype so maybe I'll do a follow up
with<00:03:06.430> something<00:03:07.240> more<00:03:07.500> professional<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.950> you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
with something more professional if you

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.610 
with something more professional if you
will<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.610> also<00:03:10.510> been<00:03:10.750> thinking<00:03:11.020> about<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.260> 3d

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
will and also been thinking about a 3d

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
printed sort of a backpack that all this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.890 
printed sort of a backpack that all this

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
stuff can mount to okay now on the other

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.530 
stuff can mount to okay now on the other
end<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.290> actually<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:17.920> Bixler<00:03:18.550> set<00:03:19.420> up

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
end I actually have this Bixler set up

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.200 
end I actually have this Bixler set up
with<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> PM<00:03:20.140> 2.5<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:21.130> I've<00:03:21.220> been<00:03:21.370> messing

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
with a PM 2.5 that I've been messing

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.940 
with a PM 2.5 that I've been messing
around<00:03:22.300> with<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.990> right<00:03:23.230> now<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.500> have<00:03:23.830> it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
around with and right now I just have it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.520 
around with and right now I just have it
set<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.220> manual<00:03:24.700> mode<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.990> it's<00:03:26.170> kind<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.470> a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
set in manual mode so it's kind of a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.410 
set in manual mode so it's kind of a
pass<00:03:26.740> through<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.220> APM<00:03:27.670> isn't<00:03:27.970> doing<00:03:28.180> much

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
pass through the APM isn't doing much

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.570 
pass through the APM isn't doing much
but<00:03:28.960> it<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.200> providing<00:03:29.650> telemetry<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.310> if<00:03:30.490> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
but it is providing telemetry and if you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.200 
but it is providing telemetry and if you
notice<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.440> LED<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.620> constant<00:03:33.190> green<00:03:33.430> which

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
notice the LED is constant green which

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.600 
notice the LED is constant green which
means<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.840> paired<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.410> communicating<00:03:36.400> with

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
means it's paired and communicating with

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.270 
means it's paired and communicating with
the<00:03:36.840> radio<00:03:37.840> connected<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> Bluetooth

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the radio connected to the Bluetooth

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.240 
the radio connected to the Bluetooth
module<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.720> ground<00:03:40.990> radio<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.980> guy<00:03:42.190> you

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
module so the ground radio this guy you

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.820 
module so the ground radio this guy you
can<00:03:42.580> see<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.030> paired<00:03:43.360> with<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.200> APM<00:03:44.650> on

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
can see that it's paired with the APM on

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.520 
can see that it's paired with the APM on
the<00:03:44.950> Bixler<00:03:45.370> for<00:03:45.970> starters<00:03:46.450> I'm<00:03:46.690> going<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the Bixler for starters I'm going to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.890 
the Bixler for starters I'm going to
pair<00:03:47.770> this<00:03:47.950> with<00:03:48.010> my<00:03:48.340> macbook<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.090> we'll<00:03:49.720> hook

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
pair this with my macbook and we'll hook

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.590 
pair this with my macbook and we'll hook
up<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.310> serial<00:03:51.310> port<00:03:51.520> monitor<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.360> just

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
up a serial port monitor that can just

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.780 
up a serial port monitor that can just
see<00:03:52.780> if<00:03:52.930> we're<00:03:53.200> receiving<00:03:53.770> data<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.520> then

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
see if we're receiving data and then

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.190 
see if we're receiving data and then
we'll<00:03:54.910> work<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.240> connecting<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.780> Bluetooth

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
we'll work on connecting the Bluetooth

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.220 
we'll work on connecting the Bluetooth
from<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.040> Samsung<00:03:57.310> Android<00:03:57.910> planner<00:03:58.330> okay<00:03:59.170> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
from the Samsung Android planner okay so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.720 
from the Samsung Android planner okay so
what<00:03:59.500> I'm<00:03:59.560> going<00:03:59.710> to<00:03:59.740> do<00:03:59.860> now<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.220> I'm<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.580> to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.150 
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
launch<00:04:01.170> Z<00:04:02.170> term<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:04.710> when<00:04:05.710> I<00:04:05.740> do<00:04:05.830> I'm<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.070> to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
launch Z term and when I do I'm going to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.950 
launch Z term and when I do I'm going to
hit<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> shift<00:04:06.670> key<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.090> click<00:04:07.180> on<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.720> and

hit the shift key and click on this and

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.880 
hit the shift key and click on this and
it<00:04:08.830> will<00:04:08.950> ask<00:04:09.190> me<00:04:09.960> which<00:04:10.960> serial<00:04:11.380> port<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.740> want

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
it will ask me which serial port I want

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.310 
it will ask me which serial port I want
to<00:04:11.950> connect<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.520> so<00:04:12.940> in<00:04:13.240> this<00:04:13.720> case<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:14.110> want<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
to connect to so in this case I want to

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.310 
to connect to so in this case I want to
connect<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.830> droid<00:04:15.040> planner<00:04:15.370> Bluetooth

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
connect to the droid planner Bluetooth

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.950 
connect to the droid planner Bluetooth
I'm<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.500> hit<00:04:17.590> OK<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.390> what<00:04:19.390> we<00:04:19.720> should

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
I'm going to hit OK and what we should

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.900 
I'm going to hit OK and what we should
be<00:04:20.080> seeing<00:04:20.380> here<00:04:20.500> modeling<00:04:21.100> messages<00:04:21.640> now

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
be seeing here modeling messages now

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.140 
be seeing here modeling messages now
this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.570> believe<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.680> binary<00:04:24.340> format<00:04:24.940> so

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
this is I believe a binary format so

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.530 
this is I believe a binary format so
we're<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.390> going<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.540> be<00:04:25.630> able<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.840> make<00:04:25.990> sense

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
we're not going to be able to make sense

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.430 
we're not going to be able to make sense
this<00:04:26.630> but<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.620> does<00:04:27.860> demonstrate<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:29.440> we're

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
this but it does demonstrate that we're

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.430 
this but it does demonstrate that we're
receiving<00:04:30.770> data<00:04:31.130> over<00:04:31.730> Bluetooth<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:33.140> let's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
receiving data over Bluetooth so let's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.620

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
ahead and go out and what I'm going to

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.390 
ahead and go out and what I'm going to
do<00:05:11.960> next<00:05:12.170> in<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.560> launch<00:05:12.740> droid<00:05:13.160> planner<00:05:15.400> so

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
do next in the launch droid planner so

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.390 
do next in the launch droid planner so
this<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.700> our<00:05:16.820> default<00:05:17.030> screen<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.070> then<00:05:19.070> I'm

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
this is our default screen and then I'm

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.890 
this is our default screen and then I'm
going<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:20.140> set<00:05:21.140> up<00:05:21.260> our<00:05:21.410> connection<00:05:21.980> type<00:05:22.900> go

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
going to set up our connection type go

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.060 
going to set up our connection type go
Bluetooth<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:27.880> 57600<00:05:28.990> baud<00:05:29.990> rate<00:05:30.320> you've

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
Bluetooth and 57600 baud rate you've

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.710 
Bluetooth and 57600 baud rate you've
seen<00:05:31.250> in<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.460> previous<00:05:31.670> video<00:05:32.060> we<00:05:32.330> showed<00:05:32.420> how

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
seen in a previous video we showed how

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720 
seen in a previous video we showed how
to<00:05:32.750> set<00:05:32.990> up<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.260> baud<00:05:33.440> rate<00:05:33.710> for<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.430> actual

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
to set up the baud rate for the actual

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.550 
to set up the baud rate for the actual
module<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.660> what<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.870> should<00:05:36.110> be<00:05:36.230> able<00:05:36.290> to<00:05:36.410> do

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
module so what I should be able to do

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.430 
module so what I should be able to do
next<00:05:36.820> close<00:05:37.820> out<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.000> that<00:05:38.120> menu<00:05:38.420> hit<00:05:39.290> connect

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
next close out of that menu hit connect

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.780 
next close out of that menu hit connect
and<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:45.380> can<00:05:45.560> see<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.070> zoomed<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.580> and

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
and you can see that it zoomed in and

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.710 
and you can see that it zoomed in and
shows<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.090> orientation<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.250> our<00:05:49.250> plane<00:05:50.000> you

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
shows the orientation of our plane you

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.150 
shows the orientation of our plane you
can<00:05:50.900> see<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.200> data<00:05:51.380> is<00:05:51.530> coming<00:05:51.740> in<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.010> this

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
can see that data is coming in on this

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.900 
can see that data is coming in on this
side<00:05:52.300> now<00:05:53.300> let's<00:05:53.510> just<00:05:53.660> take<00:05:53.870> a<00:05:53.900> look<00:05:54.170> as<00:05:54.350> I

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
side now let's just take a look as I

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.070 
side now let's just take a look as I
roll<00:05:55.910> this<00:05:56.150> plane<00:05:56.800> around<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.040> pitch<00:05:58.340> it

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
roll this plane around and I pitch it

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.480 
roll this plane around and I pitch it
you<00:06:00.080> can<00:06:00.260> see<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.680> droid<00:06:00.890> planner<00:06:01.220> app

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
you can see that the droid planner app

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.780 
you can see that the droid planner app
updates<00:06:02.480> nicely<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.800> show<00:06:04.070> you<00:06:04.130> if<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:04.460> change

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
updates nicely and show you if I change

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.990 
updates nicely and show you if I change
the<00:06:05.030> actual<00:06:05.330> orientation<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.580> turn<00:06:07.820> the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000

the actual orientation so I turn the
plane<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:09.830> see<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:10.130> update<00:06:10.520> on<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.850> map<00:06:11.090> and

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
plane you see the update on the map and

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.620 
plane you see the update on the map and
in<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.680> future<00:06:12.890> video<00:06:13.130> I'll<00:06:13.460> show<00:06:13.670> the

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
in a future video I'll show the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.460 
in a future video I'll show the
different<00:06:14.990> flight<00:06:15.230> modes<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.860> how<00:06:15.980> to<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.610> do

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
different flight modes and how to I do

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.830 
different flight modes and how to I do
mission<00:06:18.470> planning<00:06:19.240> using<00:06:20.240> your<00:06:20.450> droid

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
mission planning using your droid

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.560 
mission planning using your droid
planner<00:06:21.140> app<00:06:21.760> now<00:06:22.760> one<00:06:23.150> thing<00:06:23.330> that<00:06:23.450> I'm

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
planner app now one thing that I'm

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.050 
planner app now one thing that I'm
hoping<00:06:23.900> to<00:06:24.020> do<00:06:24.200> is<00:06:24.440> you'll<00:06:25.130> notice<00:06:25.490> this<00:06:25.640> Cluj

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
hoping to do is you'll notice this Cluj

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.350 
hoping to do is you'll notice this Cluj
of<00:06:26.480> wires<00:06:27.230> and<00:06:27.830> so<00:06:28.040> my<00:06:28.280> plan<00:06:28.550> is<00:06:28.580> to<00:06:28.820> in<00:06:29.300> the

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
of wires and so my plan is to in the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.630 
of wires and so my plan is to in the
coming<00:06:29.990> weeks<00:06:30.350> kind<00:06:30.650> of<00:06:30.710> improve<00:06:31.100> this<00:06:31.340> setup

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
coming weeks kind of improve this setup

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.880 
coming weeks kind of improve this setup
and<00:06:31.970> as<00:06:32.060> I<00:06:32.180> mentioned<00:06:32.540> design<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.230> 3d<00:06:33.410> printed

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
and as I mentioned design and 3d printed

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.810 
and as I mentioned design and 3d printed
case<00:06:34.390> that<00:06:35.390> can<00:06:35.540> hold<00:06:35.750> all<00:06:35.930> this<00:06:36.110> together<00:06:36.350> so

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
case that can hold all this together so

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.950 
case that can hold all this together so
perhaps<00:06:37.820> that's<00:06:38.090> something<00:06:38.450> that<00:06:38.600> we<00:06:38.750> can

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
perhaps that's something that we can

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.310 
perhaps that's something that we can
collaborate<00:06:39.260> on<00:06:39.590> together

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
collaborate on together

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.830 
collaborate on together
as<00:06:40.380> we<00:06:41.340> did<00:06:41.520> previously<00:06:41.730> with<00:06:42.120> a<00:06:42.300> multi-week

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
as we did previously with a multi-week

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.290 
as we did previously with a multi-week
ace<00:06:43.140> but<00:06:43.950> in<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.190> meantime<00:06:44.400> I'm<00:06:44.730> going<00:06:44.910> to<00:06:45.060> be

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
ace but in the meantime I'm going to be

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.300 
ace but in the meantime I'm going to be
experimenting<00:06:46.110> with<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.320> setup<00:06:46.680> just<00:06:46.830> to<00:06:47.100> see

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
experimenting with the setup just to see

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.670 
experimenting with the setup just to see
how<00:06:47.430> it<00:06:47.610> works<00:06:47.880> and<00:06:48.240> do<00:06:48.870> some<00:06:49.080> testing<00:06:49.470> in<00:06:49.590> the

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
how it works and do some testing in the

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.440 
how it works and do some testing in the
field<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:50.610> great<00:06:50.850> thing<00:06:51.030> about<00:06:51.060> this

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
field the great thing about this

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.810 
field the great thing about this
solution<00:06:51.630> is<00:06:52.110> you<00:06:52.800> can<00:06:52.950> have<00:06:53.130> this<00:06:53.280> somewhat

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
solution is you can have this somewhat

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.470 
solution is you can have this somewhat
portable<00:06:54.300> while<00:06:54.510> your<00:06:55.500> Bluetooth<00:06:56.360> setup<00:06:57.360> is

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 
portable while your Bluetooth setup is

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.570 
portable while your Bluetooth setup is
on<00:06:57.630> the<00:06:57.750> ground<00:06:58.050> so<00:06:58.920> that<00:06:58.950> was<00:06:59.250> a<00:06:59.280> fun

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
on the ground so that was a fun

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.670 
on the ground so that was a fun
experiment<00:07:00.510> just<00:07:00.690> to<00:07:00.960> get<00:07:01.170> this<00:07:01.350> up<00:07:01.560> and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
experiment just to get this up and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.370 
experiment just to get this up and
running<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.250> finally<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:03.030> data<00:07:03.750> coming<00:07:04.020> across

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
running and finally a data coming across

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.070 
running and finally a data coming across
