00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.880
 The first non-eye 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 If you look at it , it will not pull right away 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.950
 Since the retreat from singing Ome and rhythm is the best I think I want to do it that way 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.790

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.440

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.250

 boo foo woo ba 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:04.220
 Is it so cool to receive this part consciously and draw the rhythm so as not to break it ? 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.210
 I think 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:15.280
 The rest is that whole note on the left so it's nice to have room 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.700
 I think it will be easier to put on the right hand 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.780
