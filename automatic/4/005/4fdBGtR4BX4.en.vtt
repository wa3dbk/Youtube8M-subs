00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.640
 antonia of logical doors that I said in 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.519
 the last video that would 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.250
 this first logical door that does not the 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.450
 annul gets inside because it's too much 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 basic is a door 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 and that is if the off output of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.400
 output is on and if we turn on the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.080
 input output has been paid 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.310
 in that is practically what is lowered 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 what all the doors are based on 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.980
 logical 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.880
 but get creative 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 that is a door org 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.690
 that with just one of the two 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.540
 the wood is on and it lights 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.810
 you just need to be one 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.020
 any of the two functions 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.500
 and it 's the same because you see it's an x ​​org and 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.970
 with only one of the two being 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.970
 on and although it has stopped 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.040
 then the door and more like 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.729
 expanded let's say and this is that they have 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.920
 to be both 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.060
 the two imputed lit the input is 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.870
 this is not that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 the lit the author goes off 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.560
 but all 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 has to be taken care of and with that only 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.300
 turn off one and you have already paid the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.010
 car 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.050
 It is very simple to build for 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.490
 build it only by putting me here 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.220
 the blocks 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.620
 we put to make a complete we put 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.850
 three islands and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.009
 together so a torch on each side 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.009
 the two levers that would be the inputs 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:02.810
 and here appears the exit to one of these 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:06.189
 outputs off and on the program 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.189
 and for this to be done descended 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.520
 this 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.930
 this is the same only that more reduced 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.040
 and this is also the same but for 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 as corner shape works 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.159
 exactly the same 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.530
 they do exactly the same thing just that they are 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.060
 different types of doing it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.459
 this is a n 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.540
 that if the exits to see the output comes out 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.900
 turned on to pass this from the pistons 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.530
 disappear here blocks 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.530
 with plugs 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.830
 it does not happen to me in any other normal 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.370
 ok here is linear have to be the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.340
 two lit so that the output comes out 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.010
 turned off yesterday in reverse 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.110
 and that only one is with that only 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.470
 one of the notes has been paid already 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.470
 they have defended 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.220
 and that that is one of the two and is 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.880
 off already know the way out my sense 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.880
 it's worth that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.110
 sum x org 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 what to see if I can explain to his 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.780
 function 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.770
 that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.230
 with which one of the inputs is on 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.360
 the author leaves on but if 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.380
 we turn on the two imputed is was the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.050
 press off 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.420
 is the simple thing for example this is for 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.780
 if you have at home but I will explain 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.990
 because it is very useful 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.630
 to see if the door 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.630
 to make a goal 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.670
 we have a door with a lever here 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.400
 we want it to open from here and 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.560
 we want here there is also another 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.380
 lever to make the door 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.900
 here we see that this 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.920
 it's not granted because I went home and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.050
 I can not make the door only serve to 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.760
 this 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.180
 we go home imagine you going up 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.460
 door we enter the house we open the door 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 and we are this would already be inside the house 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.210
 we descend and the door would go out already 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.220
 come out we do this we have it in the 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.220
 door we integrate the door 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.889
 this is an rs in hordes this is like 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.039
 for 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.039
 you know for example that if I'm going to do 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.850
 let's see if I take a button if we put a 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.370
 button and we give it a one second pulse 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.380
 then for this to be maintained 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.360
 we see that those the piston would have if 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.910
 we want to make a button stay 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.940
 turned on we just make a truth 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.880
 let it be if we put 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.400
 what you have for three what in each 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.110
 side a torch that of current to 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.480
 this is the current this and here 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.550
 come out the aura then many times voice 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.060
 and as we see the piston is lying 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.800
 it stays like this forever until here 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.540
 if we if we see that if we are going to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.610
 give here does not work we have to give it to 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.270
 the other 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.270
 Saturday 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.930
 it's an X not that it's for the same thing 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.140
 the other one that only invests have to 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.140
 to be 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.120
 I explain sack that only with that a 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.010
 input is on the out to share has 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.270
 paid and if we turn on the inputs the 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.420
 output comes on 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.330
 OK 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.830
 this I do not have a life that's what I saw it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.530
 I do not remember where and is served if 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.800
 with what if we are if we understand one of 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.210
 they 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.340
 So if we feel that one of them 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.060
 turn off the one next to us 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.540
 we will go 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.950
 but if we light both at once 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.600
 know if we understand that this is no longer the 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.520
 I would let you press it and I would not let you pay 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.360
 s 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.490
 it is necessary to return here 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:33.190
 to get that out and activate 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:37.620
 off and now activities 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.620
 we arrived here and it would close 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:45.270
 and that which is also very useful for 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.270
 use a button as a lever let's say 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.520
 we see that here it is off 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.699
 we press the button once 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.699
 and if we press again and it turns off 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.800
 It is very simple 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.509
 and well that has been everything there are many more 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.330
 logical doors three-way properties 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.949
 for a friend of mine asks me a lot 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.039
 of times how do you do some things that 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.659
 they try to make an adventure map 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.729
 So, well, so that the 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:17.349
 he seeks doors are am not 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:23.159
 they had idea of how to do them so 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:23.159
 Well, what's that going for him and goodbye
