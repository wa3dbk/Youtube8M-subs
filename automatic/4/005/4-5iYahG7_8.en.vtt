00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.660
 very good everyone i'm joselu 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.549
 welcome to this new video and good 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.559
 tell you first of all that you are 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.389
 looking in the background some small summaries 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.950
 of the videos you have had this month 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.839
 August in the channel while state 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.580
 out and good this video is more than anything 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.440
 to tell you that I'm already back in 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.810
 home I'm back as you can see 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.300
 in the title of the video and you do not know the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.880
 I wanted to return from power 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.740
 keep making videos playing fifa 's 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.750
 been practically a month without playing 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.370
 fifa without watching videos but good as 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.559
 I was saying I'm already here again in 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.690
 home so it's going to come back all the pace 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.059
 of the channel to normality I've even 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.710
 thought about uploading more videos than before 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.960
 let me go on vacation go up a 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.969
 video every two days or so tell me what 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.800
 seem the comments and I also wanted 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.199
 tell you a little about the current series 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.909
 that we have in the channel the part of the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.769
 of the signing of the month that is good 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.239
 pretty clear how is the dynamics of a 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.730
 video a month of a player that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.219
 I recommend but good the series of 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.749
 valence and the bright are we in 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.969
 what is going to be the last season that 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.339
 play figure 13 is worth because fifa 14 goes 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.170
 to go out in barely a month so like 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.090
 I say this season will be the last one 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.549
 play on fifa 13 both in the mode 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.399
 with the valence of joselu as in the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.100
 brighton and good would be ethical the truth 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.679
 finish in these two these two way 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.240
 race then with a double in the 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.920
 brighton and with a triple have valence 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.280
 that will not be easy but good 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.679
 let's go for everything and let's try 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.659
 fire fifa 13 the most epic 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.579
 possible with all the titles that are 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.319
 I can win and well I also wanted to 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.659
 take this video for 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.280
 thank you that we are more than 3000 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.959
 subscribers in the channel there has not been 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.849
 special is worth it because it was outside 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:42.819
 home then I could not prepare anything 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.709
 I did not have anything in mind either, it was good 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.349
 there was no special why I'm sorry 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.239
 but it has coincided the dates that was 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.250
 off and it has not been and will see to 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.959
 the next one that occurs to me but good 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.000
 thanks to all of you who have arrived 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.799
 new ones that you are here for 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 time because as I say without you the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.149
 channel would not have any sense of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.250
 really good be thanks to all those who 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.110
 you see the videos you leave a like a 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.569
 comment or anything you 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.819
 you make this channel possible and 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.130
 well speaking a little bit of number 14 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.750
 also because as you all me 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.790
 I imagine I have already very much 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 I want you to leave both the demo and the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.440
 game because it is practically no longer 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.180
 almost nothing for them to come out and well many 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.920
 you asked me in the comments 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.270
 of the last videos that I already know with 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.730
 what teams will I start the modes 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.400
 race in fifa 14 as much as joselu 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.150
 as the manager and well I will tell you that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.030
 I have several ideas in mind and especially 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.459
 the career of manager I think that we 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.860
 will surprise you quite and at the same time 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.620
 will like it because it 's something special 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.080
 that if I get it right I really have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 a lot of hope in what I'm 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.100
 preparing I can not say more because if 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.590
 does not lose enough emotion so good 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.270
 if I finally get it right and 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.060
 everything goes right because I think that you 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.410
 It will surprise you a lot and you will like it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 basically because it's something pretty 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.000
 novelty that looks very very little by 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.770
 youtube and I think it's going to give a lot 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 fun so much for me and playing that 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.420
 Career mode as for you watching it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.220
 so I better not tell you anything else because 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.440
 if you're not going to end up catching me and going to 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.000
 lose all the emotion so good 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.860
 friends this I think that was all that you 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.600
 had to say today in this video that already 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.560
 I'm back at home that you're going to have 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.209
 Many 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.170
 videos from now on all the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.170
 series that the endings of ypf to 13 like 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.209
 I say come pretty epic and what good 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.060
 that for fifa 14 you know I have 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.069
 several ideas in mind pretty good 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.680
 good friends this would be all see you 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.980
