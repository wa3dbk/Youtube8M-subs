00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
LeBron James throughout the season would

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.870

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
have taken that shot and I think it's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.850 
have taken that shot and I think it's
not<00:03:03.090> his<00:03:03.299> shot<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.989> bait<00:03:04.320> him<00:03:04.500> into<00:03:04.680> taking

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
not his shot you bait him into taking

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.620

that<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.730> hope<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.269> he's<00:03:06.450> good

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
that that's what you hope if he's good

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.120 
that that's what you hope if he's good
enough<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.900> make<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.350> given<00:03:07.650> night<00:03:07.680> you

well<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.920> wonder<00:03:40.190> how<00:03:40.400> much<00:03:40.550> of<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.760> was

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
well you wonder how much of it was

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.250 
well you wonder how much of it was
LeBron<00:03:41.210> tonight<00:03:41.480> how<00:03:41.630> much<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.930> was<00:03:42.020> Erik

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
LeBron tonight how much of it was Erik

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.660 
LeBron tonight how much of it was Erik
Spoelstra<00:03:42.620> how<00:03:42.740> much<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.040> was<00:03:43.160> something<00:03:43.550> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
Spoelstra how much it was something that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.310 
Spoelstra how much it was something that
the<00:03:43.760> team<00:03:43.970> discussed<00:03:44.570> because<00:03:44.960> there's<00:03:45.140> no

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
the team discussed because there's no

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.720 
the team discussed because there's no
doubt<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.770> LeBron<00:03:46.310> James<00:03:46.580> had<00:03:46.700> a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
doubt that that LeBron James had a

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.370 
doubt that that LeBron James had a
different<00:03:47.150> mentality<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.990> think<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.320> the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
different mentality I think in the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.260 
different mentality I think in the
fourth<00:03:48.590> quarter<00:03:48.800> of<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.130> game<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.550> going

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
fourth quarter of this game and going

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.000 
fourth quarter of this game and going
forward<00:03:50.630> that's<00:03:50.810> how<00:03:50.960> it<00:03:51.200> has<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> be<00:03:51.740> if<00:03:51.890> they

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
forward that's how it has to be if they

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.530 
forward that's how it has to be if they
revert<00:03:52.400> back<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.670> their<00:03:52.880> old<00:03:52.940> ways<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.450> they

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
revert back to their old ways and they

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.360 
revert back to their old ways and they
get<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:53.780> tight<00:03:53.990> moments<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.470> they<00:03:54.860> let<00:03:55.040> LeBron

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
get in tight moments and they let LeBron

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.190 
get in tight moments and they let LeBron
James<00:03:55.640> bring<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.090> ball<00:03:56.270> up<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.720> floor<00:03:56.900> and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
James bring the ball up the floor and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.800 
James bring the ball up the floor and
decide<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.040> try<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:58.580> great<00:03:58.910> against<00:03:59.360> a<00:03:59.450> set

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
decide to try to be great against a set

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.660 
decide to try to be great against a set
defense<00:04:00.410> time<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.100> time<00:04:01.220> again

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
defense time and time again

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.800 
defense time and time again
then<00:04:01.850> they're<00:04:02.000> gonna<00:04:02.060> revert<00:04:02.390> back<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.720> their

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
then they're gonna revert back to their

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.450 
then they're gonna revert back to their
old<00:04:02.870> habits<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.590> team<00:04:03.800> could<00:04:04.220> get

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
old habits and this team could get

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.650 
old habits and this team could get
knocked<00:04:04.670> out<00:04:04.850> in<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> first<00:04:05.090> round<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.570> they

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
knocked out in the first round if they

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.690 
knocked out in the first round if they
get<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> wrong<00:04:05.960> matchup<00:04:06.410> if<00:04:06.740> they<00:04:07.130> play<00:04:07.460> that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
get the wrong matchup if they play that

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.580 
get the wrong matchup if they play that
way<00:04:07.910> down<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.360> stretch<00:04:08.660> they<00:04:09.110> didn't<00:04:09.500> do<00:04:09.560> it

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
way down the stretch they didn't do it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.380 
way down the stretch they didn't do it
tonight<00:04:09.920> hopefully<00:04:10.550> they<00:04:10.700> go<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.000> watch<00:04:11.150> this

that you can say he really has to prove

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.740 
that you can say he really has to prove
something<00:04:40.700> now<00:04:40.880> he's<00:04:41.000> got<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.210> deliver<00:04:41.420> he's

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
something now he's got to deliver he's

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.780 
something now he's got to deliver he's
got<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.110> prove<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.650> he<00:04:42.950> could<00:04:43.100> win<00:04:43.400> and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
got to prove that that he could win and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.430 
got to prove that that he could win and
to<00:04:44.000> win<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.510> best<00:04:44.750> thing<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:44.930> he<00:04:45.110> could<00:04:45.260> do

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
to win the best thing that he could do

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.920 
to win the best thing that he could do
is<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.890> facilitate<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.880> allow<00:04:47.120> others<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.540> be

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
is to facilitate and allow others to be

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.510 
is to facilitate and allow others to be
guys<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.440> could<00:04:48.800> score<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.130> ball<00:04:49.250> down<00:04:49.400> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
guys that could score the ball down the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.710 
guys that could score the ball down the
stretch<00:04:49.760> he<00:04:49.910> doesn't<00:04:50.240> have<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.420> do<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.660> think

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
stretch he doesn't have to do it I think

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.660 
stretch he doesn't have to do it I think
there<00:04:51.050> are<00:04:51.140> times<00:04:51.320> particularly<00:04:52.280> during<00:04:52.520> this

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
there are times particularly during this

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.550 
there are times particularly during this
losing<00:04:52.940> streak<00:04:53.090> where<00:04:53.780> LeBron<00:04:53.930> James<00:04:54.380> has

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
losing streak where LeBron James has

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.710 
losing streak where LeBron James has
tried<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.040> prove<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.580> he<00:04:56.030> can<00:04:56.210> be<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.390> late

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
tried to prove that he can be a late

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.690 
tried to prove that he can be a late
game<00:04:56.960> shot<00:04:57.410> maker<00:04:57.710> we've<00:04:58.370> seen<00:04:58.610> her

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
game shot maker we've seen her

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.740 
game shot maker we've seen her
throughout<00:04:58.880> his<00:04:59.060> career<00:04:59.210> make<00:04:59.540> big<00:04:59.720> shots

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
throughout his career make big shots

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.840 
throughout his career make big shots
obviously<00:05:00.470> he<00:05:00.590> took<00:05:00.620> every<00:05:01.280> single<00:05:01.670> one<00:05:01.790> of

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
obviously he took every single one of

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.700 
obviously he took every single one of
them<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.150> Cleveland<00:05:02.600> we<00:05:02.930> know<00:05:03.170> he<00:05:03.320> can<00:05:03.500> make

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
them in Cleveland we know he can make

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.280 
them in Cleveland we know he can make
him<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.040> far<00:05:04.580> too<00:05:04.610> often<00:05:05.060> he<00:05:05.690> ends<00:05:05.990> up<00:05:06.050> taking

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
him but far too often he ends up taking

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.350 
him but far too often he ends up taking
shots<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:06.920> are<00:05:06.950> not<00:05:07.220> really<00:05:07.580> his<00:05:07.910> game<00:05:08.180> and

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
shots that are not really his game and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.210 
shots that are not really his game and
not<00:05:08.480> his<00:05:08.660> comfort<00:05:09.020> zone<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.710> think<00:05:09.980> moving

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
not his comfort zone and I think moving

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.550 
not his comfort zone and I think moving
forward<00:05:10.730> this<00:05:11.120> team<00:05:11.420> may<00:05:11.660> be<00:05:11.690> tonight<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.170> think

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
forward this team may be tonight I think

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.230 
forward this team may be tonight I think
this<00:05:12.650> could<00:05:12.830> possibly<00:05:13.580> trigger<00:05:13.940> some

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
this could possibly trigger some

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.940 
this could possibly trigger some
momentum<00:05:14.690> for<00:05:14.840> them<00:05:14.930> as<00:05:15.020> they<00:05:15.110> see<00:05:15.170> how<00:05:15.740> they

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
momentum for them as they see how they

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.770 
momentum for them as they see how they
closed<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.460> game<00:05:16.670> out<00:05:16.790> they<00:05:16.940> defended<00:05:17.450> they

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
closed this game out they defended they

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.180 
closed this game out they defended they
had<00:05:17.900> contributions<00:05:18.530> from<00:05:18.590> role<00:05:18.800> players<00:05:19.100> they

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
had contributions from role players they

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.680 
had contributions from role players they
were<00:05:19.280> great<00:05:19.610> on<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.940> glass<00:05:20.210> tonight<00:05:20.450> which

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
were great on the glass tonight which

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.660 
were great on the glass tonight which
has<00:05:20.810> been<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.960> big<00:05:21.230> weakness<00:05:21.590> for<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.800> team<00:05:21.980> 18

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
has been a big weakness for this team 18

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.760 
has been a big weakness for this team 18
offensive<00:05:22.970> rebounds<00:05:23.660> but<00:05:24.020> more<00:05:24.260> important<00:05:24.710> is

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
offensive rebounds but more important is

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.200 
offensive rebounds but more important is
how<00:05:24.920> they<00:05:25.100> handled<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.580> stress<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.150> pressure

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
how they handled the stress and pressure

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.540 
how they handled the stress and pressure
of<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.660> late-game<00:05:26.930> situation<00:05:27.650> he<00:05:28.160> was

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
of the late-game situation he was

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.490 
of the late-game situation he was
special<00:05:29.090> because<00:05:29.390> he<00:05:29.480> can<00:05:29.660> draw<00:05:29.900> people<00:05:30.350> and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
special because he can draw people and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.320 
special because he can draw people and
find<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.160> that's<00:05:31.610> what<00:05:31.790> he<00:05:31.880> has<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:32.120> do<00:05:32.240> with

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
find and that's what he has to do with

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.880
