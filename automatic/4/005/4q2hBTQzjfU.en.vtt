but<00:02:32.230> thicker<00:02:32.470> than<00:02:32.680> your<00:02:32.890> 60<00:02:33.250> millimeter<00:02:33.700> it's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
but thicker than your 60 millimeter it's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.940 
but thicker than your 60 millimeter it's
a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.510> bit<00:02:34.720> more<00:02:34.900> expensive<00:02:35.319> but<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.740> think

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
a little bit more expensive but I think

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.979 
a little bit more expensive but I think
it's<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.130> right<00:02:36.310> way<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.580> doing<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:37.150> well<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
it's a right way of doing it well you

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's a right way of doing it well you
actually<00:02:38.170> didn't<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.620> choice

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
actually didn't have a choice

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.410 
actually didn't have a choice
you<00:02:39.810> wanted<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.410> go<00:02:40.590> green<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.070> bamboo<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you wanted to go green and bamboo is it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.110 
you wanted to go green and bamboo is it
still<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.710> greenest<00:02:44.070> timber<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.670> mean<00:02:44.970> also

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
still is the greenest timber I mean also

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
still is the greenest timber I mean also
the<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.750> glues<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.320> been<00:02:46.470> used<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.310> all

the the glues have been used in all
these<00:02:47.850> boards<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> stuff<00:02:48.870> there's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
these boards and stuff there's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
formaldehyde in them and they emit for

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.670 
formaldehyde in them and they emit for
multi<00:02:53.580> into<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.970> air<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:54.960> indoor<00:02:55.440> air

with<00:02:57.870> formaldehyde<00:02:58.440> okay<00:02:59.070> that's

with formaldehyde okay that's

and<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.830> boards<00:03:05.160> falls<00:03:05.430> below<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.790> e<00:03:05.820> 1<00:03:06.270> or

and on the boards falls below the e 1 or

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 
and on the boards falls below the e 1 or
0<00:03:06.930> which<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.590> even<00:03:07.800> better<00:03:07.950> rating<00:03:08.700> for

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
0 which is even better rating for

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.910 
0 which is even better rating for
formaldehyde<00:03:09.600> emission<00:03:10.080> which<00:03:10.560> i<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.740> is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
formaldehyde emission which i think is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.040 
formaldehyde emission which i think is
0.5<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.180> parts<00:03:13.050> per<00:03:13.260> million<00:03:13.530> well<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
0.5 and parts per million well so a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.700 
0.5 and parts per million well so a
significant<00:03:16.050> difference<00:03:16.350> between<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
significant difference between the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.690 
significant difference between the
bamboo<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.750> your<00:03:18.750> baseballs<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
bamboo and your baseballs so is the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.760 
bamboo and your baseballs so is the
bamboo<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.210> green<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:22.080> glues<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.590> green

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
bamboo is green and the glues of green

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.980 
bamboo is green and the glues of green
so<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.400> that's<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> good<00:03:23.850> one<00:03:24.030> product

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
so that's what that's a good one product

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.480 
so that's what that's a good one product
I<00:03:25.140> think<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.800> should<00:03:25.830> you've<00:03:26.280> got<00:03:26.460> a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
I think what we should you've got a

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.310 
I think what we should you've got a
cutting<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.030> day<00:03:27.210> because<00:03:27.360> I'm<00:03:27.840> getting

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
boots onto that so that they can start

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.310 
boots onto that so that they can start
cutting<00:03:32.970> as<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.360> caucuses<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.960> can<00:03:34.110> put<00:03:34.260> it
