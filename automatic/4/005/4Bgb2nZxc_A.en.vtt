00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.189
 hello youtube friends I'm mister but 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.720
 once again and this time we are going to do the 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.520
 challenge play dough episode 16 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.930
 so this time we're going to do the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.350
 request of kevin nash zavala and an air 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:22.240
 Gutierrez who asked me to make a mark 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.240
 and I miss myself I 'm going so let's start 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.870
 ah 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 I'll be able to give some account 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 recording this time at night I had some 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 occupations in the morning and that's why 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.769
 I bring you this video so a little 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.409
 later 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:55.379
 you know a little bit my good god let's go to 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.290
 do first I think better because then 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.339
 it's simpler so you can give yourself a 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.339
 idea of how bad I am 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.080
 good 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.860
 here is your head 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.190
 I do not know whether to do it smaller because I eat 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 at this time I have no less dough 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.670
 for meco I go because I could be 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 great but if not to encompass then 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.970
 let's start doing for their eyes or 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 idea of ​​how I'm going to make your eyes I'm going to 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 improvise a little 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.240
 well here they see me doing to me like today 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.220
 As you can see I'm making that big streak 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.700
 black to make the outline of your eyes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.380
 to give that idea 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.219
 Well, it's a drawing 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.680
 then what your eyes mark in this 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.780
 white background make your face 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.580
 for those simple black stripes so 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.960
 that's how I interpreted it to look good 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.580
 now that his good body also like 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.260
 see this the problem is that that little mouth 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.780
 in the end 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.480
 Well, he did not fully convince for at least 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.480
 I can say it's better I'm going to at least 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.110
 over his body I will make a kind 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.700
 of sack 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 with two protuberances 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.709
 like a tree branch let's say 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 And those hands that are the same as a 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.330
 bits 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.920
 a new one did not need a toothpick 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.920
 for his head that was good 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.490
 well you can say has been left me convoy 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.020
 and now we're going to start making encompass 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.680
 trying to keep the same 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.680
 proportions 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.200
 it's something like this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 is going to be nightmare make your shirt 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.020
 stripes 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.020
 what I can think of is to make a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.290
 of stripes how are you and do this 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.519
 and in this way make your the stripes of 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.519
 his shirt 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.300
 of bee the colors of a bee 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.640
 let's see the black is a little bit more 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.640
 thin that is going to do it 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.409
 something like that 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.409
 of the same for your hands 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.340
 good since we are doing the hands of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.030
 dark at your hands to the best and not the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.880
 it has exactly that way but good not 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.930
 it does not happen that it looks worse or something 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.109
 A) Yes 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.530
 it really does not matter at all and then I 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.739
 I wanted to say about knowing that I have seen 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.320
 all episodes I consider myself a great 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.639
 fan but at least one fan I'm 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.639
 subscribed and everything 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.350
 and it's about 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.829
 meco go and give face 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.110
 Well, I consider them characters 

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:40.260
 authentic and great not 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.650
 because as a beginning vettel have 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.300
 started as a good while they are 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.520
 seeing there that I'm doing color 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.320
 purple with red and blue if you do not 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.050
 they knew why that really 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.409
 they teach in the primary hahaha good 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.889
 I said that 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:01.249
 they are a perfect couple obviously not 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.929
 sentimental but they complement each other 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.569
 perfectly the personalities of 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:08.779
 mexico I'm so serious 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.279
 this worker who gets angry and rites very 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.289
 easily 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:16.660
 together with dark arc who is a person 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.660
 which is the opposite that bothers 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.880
 no no mark do not get upset about anything 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.420
 he likes to have fun and annoy the 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.810
 others trolling what would you say this 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.630
 I made a mouth first based on the 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.250
 drawing that I was looking at but 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.020
 then I took it off because it really is not 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.780
 I thought he was smiling but 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.310
 as I do not know what I thought it was like 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.740
 If I had a white uav on my face 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.620
 at the end I put that little mouth that I told you 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.980
 Well, it's not exactly what you have to give 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.680
 face but it is then if I do not 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.660
 it bothers me hope you do not either 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.670
 I hope I'm serious I hope it and my hair 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.820
 actually the hair was the worst of all 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:01.289
 I did not know how to do the hair I wanted 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.960
 do it as a kind of goku hair 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.020
 I really do not have anything like goku 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.789
 convinced then I thought about making him a 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.330
 town back here like the one I have 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.330
 LOL 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.110
 his barbs after his hair I realized 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.270
 that he has all of them towards 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.490
 left or right looking at it 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.700
 from your point of view then I did it 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:30.820
 that way and then he gave me convinced me 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:32.470
 is very young this also mix the 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.740
 black and the gray that I had left for 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.840
 make your pants and in the end this one yes 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.600
 I regret that a little more was left 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.150
 great to give face but afterwards although not 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.860
 I passed it on camera I solved it 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:49.050
 putting a little more leg I'm going 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.050
 He even went there and I did not wave 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.980
 Well, I liked how they were 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.949

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.479
 little about how baby is going to see if I 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.280

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.410
