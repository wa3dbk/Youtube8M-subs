of<00:00:35.219> doing<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.640> I've<00:00:35.790> heard<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.719> let's<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.140> all

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of doing it I've heard so let's get all

these cannons up to level 12 so 876 yes
we<00:00:41.460> should<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.730> able<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.940> afford<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we should be able to afford most of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
we should be able to afford most of
these<00:00:42.510> cannons<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.379> oops<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

these cannons so oops I don't want that
no<00:00:44.910> no<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.620> don't<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.739> any<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.039> gems<00:00:47.309> too

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
no no I don't want any more gems too

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.420 
no no I don't want any more gems too
expensive<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.829> where's<00:00:50.160> another

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
expensive there we go so where's another

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
expensive there we go so where's another
cannon<00:00:50.940> good<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> fill<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> up

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
cannon good and we got to fill it up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.450 
cannon good and we got to fill it up
again<00:00:57.469> guys<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> cannons<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.340> do

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
again guys I think the cannons will do

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.599 
again guys I think the cannons will do
great<00:00:59.640> against<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.449> much<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:01.609> attacks

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
great against pretty much all attacks

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
great against pretty much all attacks
except<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.120> air<00:01:03.239> defense<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.899> except<00:01:04.199> for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
except for air defense are except for

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
except for air defense are except for
aerial<00:01:04.830> attacks<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:05.939> okay<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.750> we

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
aerial attacks but that's okay if we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
aerial attacks but that's okay if we
have<00:01:07.080> any<00:01:07.200> extra<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> our<00:01:08.310> air

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
have any extra will use them on our air

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
have any extra will use them on our air
defenses<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:09.930> that'll<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.530> think

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
defenses and I think that'll be I think

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
defenses and I think that'll be I think
we<00:01:10.830> should<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.460> couple<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.299> extra<00:01:12.630> gems

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
we should have a couple more extra gems

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.420 
we should have a couple more extra gems
so<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.860> ahead<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.010> fill<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.280> up

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so let's go ahead and fill this up

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.800 
so let's go ahead and fill this up
actually<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.119> might<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> able<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
actually we can might be able to do this
