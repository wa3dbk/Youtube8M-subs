00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
good challenge but usually that setup

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
good challenge but usually that setup
won't<00:01:31.110> kill<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.979> setup<00:01:35.220> won't<00:01:35.460> kill

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
won't kill the now that setup won't kill
the<00:01:35.880> Patriot<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> does<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.640> you're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the Patriot but if it does then you're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.859 
the Patriot but if it does then you're
gonna<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.119> trouble<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> hands<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
gonna have more trouble on hands so I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.149 
gonna have more trouble on hands so I
guess<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.560> say<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
guess this you can say but this is the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.620 
guess this you can say but this is the
worst<00:01:41.310> case<00:01:41.490> scenario<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> strategy

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
worst case scenario but this strategy

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.670 
worst case scenario but this strategy
works<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.259> well

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
works as well

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
works as well
whenever<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.640> fight<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.420> handymen

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
whenever you fight these two handymen

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
as easy as these ones but the only two

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.120 
as easy as these ones but the only two
hard<00:04:30.270> ones<00:04:30.479> on<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:31.350> OPS's<00:04:31.710> element<00:04:32.039> is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
because it's very hard to figure out

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.170
