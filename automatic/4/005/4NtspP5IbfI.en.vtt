00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
we've got another one and this is a wall

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.110 
we've got another one and this is a wall
clock<00:00:07.410> rather<00:00:07.799> like<00:00:08.040> one<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.340> mine<00:00:08.550> I'm<00:00:08.970> gonna

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
clock rather like one of mine I'm gonna

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.680 
clock rather like one of mine I'm gonna
take<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.860> show<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.429> one

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.849 

it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:17.420> 31-day<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:19.080> don't<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> make<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it's a 31-day we don't know the make of

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
it's a 31-day we don't know the make of
this<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.900> beautiful<00:00:21.900> example<00:00:23.600> coil

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
this at all beautiful example coil

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.300 
this at all beautiful example coil
strike<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> hash<00:00:28.349> sounding<00:00:28.980> strike

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
strike it's got a hash sounding strike

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
strike it's got a hash sounding strike
but<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> rather<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> looks<00:00:31.650> very

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
but I rather like it and it looks very

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.389 
but I rather like it and it looks very
similar<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.730> mine<00:00:33.829> but<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
similar to one of mine but it's got a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.680 
similar to one of mine but it's got a
better<00:00:35.610> strike<00:00:35.910> check<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> out

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.619 

you<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.680> eh<00:00:44.059> that's<00:00:45.059> awesome

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.880 

moving<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.050> onwards

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
moving a little bit onwards

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
moving a little bit onwards
well<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> clock<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:55.039> quite<00:00:56.039> quite<00:00:56.940> old<00:00:57.120> some

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
well this clock is quite quite old some

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.650 
well this clock is quite quite old some
got<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.890> 1998<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.359> brand-new<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.539> she

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
got in 1998 I think brand-new when she

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.460 
got in 1998 I think brand-new when she
bought<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.600> never<00:01:03.989> ever<00:01:04.820> seen<00:01:05.820> any

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
bought it but it's never ever seen any

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.219 
bought it but it's never ever seen any
servicing<00:01:08.000> nothing's<00:01:09.000> ever<00:01:09.119> been<00:01:09.299> done<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.359 

this<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.439> absolutely<00:01:14.090> cool<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:19.250> can't<00:01:20.250> really

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this was absolutely cool I can't really

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
this was absolutely cool I can't really
say<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.759> more<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:22.020> just

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
say a lot more about it it's just just

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770 
say a lot more about it it's just just
an<00:01:23.009> average<00:01:23.369> half<00:01:23.670> hour<00:01:23.909> strike<00:01:24.270> wall<00:01:24.540> clock

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
an average half hour strike wall clock

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
an average half hour strike wall clock
but<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.180> something

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
but I like it because it's something

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.100 
but I like it because it's something
that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.540> wouldn't<00:01:27.840> necessarily<00:01:27.990> always

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
that you wouldn't necessarily always

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.700 
that you wouldn't necessarily always
think<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> getting

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
think of getting

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.360 
think of getting
that<00:01:33.490> one's<00:01:33.670> coming<00:01:33.820> up<00:01:33.970> waiter<00:01:35.280> y'all<00:01:36.280> know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
that one's coming up waiter y'all know

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.730 
that one's coming up waiter y'all know
what<00:01:36.490> order<00:01:36.640> these<00:01:36.850> are<00:01:37.030> gonna<00:01:37.120> go<00:01:37.330> in<00:01:37.740> well

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
what order these are gonna go in well

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.780 
what order these are gonna go in well
they'll<00:01:38.830> probably<00:01:38.860> go<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.400> order<00:01:39.490> what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
they'll probably go in the order what

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.190 
they'll probably go in the order what
I've<00:01:39.880> got<00:01:40.120> them<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.420> card<00:01:40.660> when<00:01:40.870> I<00:01:40.900> upload

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
I've got them on the card when I upload

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.510 
I've got them on the card when I upload
them<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:41.890> about<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> third<00:01:42.490> or

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
them so this is about the third or

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.750 
them so this is about the third or
fourth<00:01:42.910> one<00:01:43.120> I've<00:01:43.240> covered<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:43.990> far

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
fourth one I've covered so far

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040 
fourth one I've covered so far
Sam's<00:01:45.760> got<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.000> good<00:01:46.270> collection<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.810> clocks

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
Sam's got a good collection of clocks

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.630 
Sam's got a good collection of clocks
not<00:01:47.290> as<00:01:47.410> many<00:01:47.590> as<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.830> have<00:01:47.860> but<00:01:48.220> she's<00:01:48.430> got<00:01:48.610> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
not as many as I have but she's got a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.400 
not as many as I have but she's got a
good<00:01:48.820> amount<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.600> first<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.170> saw<00:01:50.350> on

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
good amount in the first one you saw on

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.800 
good amount in the first one you saw on
that<00:01:50.500> on<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.430> videos<00:01:51.729> I've<00:01:51.880> got<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.360> far<00:01:52.390> is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
that on the videos I've got so far is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.469 
that on the videos I've got so far is
the<00:01:52.990> best<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> biggest<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:55.390> of

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
the best it's the biggest a lot of

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.820 
the best it's the biggest a lot of
people<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:55.840> commented<00:01:56.229> on<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.500> that's<00:01:56.650> what

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.040 
we like his comments positive comments
on<00:01:59.590> things<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.950> really<00:02:00.570> mean<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.630> lot<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:07.050> well

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
on things that really mean a lot so well

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.190 
on things that really mean a lot so well
I<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:09.880> only<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.179> short<00:02:10.239> one<00:02:10.660> because

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
I know this is only a short one because

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.240 
I know this is only a short one because
they're<00:02:11.290> not<00:02:11.350> really<00:02:11.560> much<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:11.920> say<00:02:12.220> about

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
they're not really much I can say about

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.770 
they're not really much I can say about
it<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.610> can't<00:02:12.820> really<00:02:13.000> show<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.390> movement

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it I can't really show you the movement

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.880 
it I can't really show you the movement
because<00:02:13.930> there's<00:02:14.110> nothing<00:02:14.200> there's<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.650> really

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
because there's nothing there's a really

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.460 
because there's nothing there's a really
show<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:15.989> behind<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.260> face

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
show it's up in there behind the face

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.780 
show it's up in there behind the face
you<00:02:17.709> can't<00:02:17.920> really<00:02:18.070> see<00:02:18.340> much<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you can't really see much of the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.979 
you can't really see much of the
movement<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.270> it's<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> typical<00:02:19.650> 31-day<00:02:21.989> quite

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
movement but it's a typical 31-day quite

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.090 
movement but it's a typical 31-day quite
nice<00:02:23.230> clock<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.150> fancy<00:02:25.360> top<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.739> know<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
nice clock with a fancy top you know I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.020
