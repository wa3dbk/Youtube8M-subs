00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hello, guys, how are you today? 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.210
 different video is about the boxing 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.240
 of the collector's edition of the 64 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 black flag for me is the most 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.480
 complete also the most expensive obviously 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.179
 well here I was removing the cardboard 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.339
 on the outside that brings us here I am 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.579
 touching the symbol of the murderers already 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.960
 that the box is with relief is worth and good 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.650
 here in the box it brings us a 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.710
 message as you can see now 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.400
 and good first we take out the metal box 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 of the game 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.240
 from behind we have the protagonist by 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.910
 in front of the assassin symbol as 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.990
 you will have appreciated and here is the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 normal game box 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.520
 I'm sorry for the blur of the mobile phone 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 I know what happened to him at that moment in the video 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 but well then I will explain to you with more 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.170

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.470
 of the edition here we have two 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470
 lithographs 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 and good then I teach you a 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.400
 canvas 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.400
 painted the protagonist here is 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.159
 edition is from a boat here you can 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.119

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.119
 there are more boats worth 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.070
 there it is and this good is a flag that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.410
 it's quite big it's like a tablecloth 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.410
 big is to say it's brutally big 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.020

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.159
 ok but it's like torn like a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.960
 pirate flag 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 is torn so much by the sides 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.990

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.500
 to teach all the components together 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.450
 so to speak at the same table all 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.550
 editing component that brings the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.450
 normal game the cover as here 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.450
 you can appreciate 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.390
 the lithographs 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.050
 the art book now that I show you the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.810

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.010
 there are the contents and then what 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.690
 is explaining the chapter by 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.220
 chapter you will see now there is the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.100

 it's a pretty pretty little book 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.210
 it's pretty good 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.970
 here is the first canvas 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.340
 that is a map that comes with the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.950
 figure a map I imagine that it will be 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.870
 of all the second game mapping 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 canvas here the soundtrack that I fight 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.400
 with her to get it out for finally not 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.580
 take out the full disk but well there 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.650
 is the soundtrack another game 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.940
 and good here the most important thing of the of 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.330
 the edition the figure of the protagonist 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.880
 seized to the initial part of the boat 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.190
 that as now I will show you 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.190

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.520
 there is 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.290
 Now this thing that is living is a 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.530
 comparison of last year's figure 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.410

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 Gray 3 and the 4th of this year as you see 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.130
 the size is quite large from that of 4 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.140
 yes both lovely and good here 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.830

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.139

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:23.240
