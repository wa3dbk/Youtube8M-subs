kamehameha<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.750> only<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.740> just<00:03:07.770> want

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
kamehameha not only that but I just want

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.230 
kamehameha not only that but I just want
to<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.250> some<00:03:08.430> more<00:03:08.460> hand<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.940> hand<00:03:09.150> combat

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
to see some more hand to hand combat

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.660 
to see some more hand to hand combat
from<00:03:09.840> him<00:03:10.050> as<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> think<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
from him as well but I think one of the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.920 
from him as well but I think one of the
most<00:03:11.790> surprising<00:03:12.330> things<00:03:12.540> about<00:03:12.660> this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
most surprising things about this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
most surprising things about this
trailer<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.830> actually<00:03:14.010> includes<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
trailer is that it actually includes the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.480 
trailer is that it actually includes the
return<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.420> beerus<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> whis<00:03:16.530> from<00:03:17.070> battle<00:03:17.370> of

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
return of beerus and whis from battle of

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.910 
return of beerus and whis from battle of
gods<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.930> biggest<00:03:19.110> assumption<00:03:19.710> at<00:03:19.800> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
gods and the biggest assumption at the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.190 
gods and the biggest assumption at the
moment<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.700> both<00:03:20.910> Vegeta<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.450> Goku<00:03:21.660> are

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
moment is that both Vegeta and Goku are

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.960 
moment is that both Vegeta and Goku are
being<00:03:22.410> trained<00:03:22.770> by<00:03:22.890> beerus<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.400> whis<00:03:23.490> and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
being trained by beerus and whis and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.280 
being trained by beerus and whis and
that's<00:03:24.270> because<00:03:24.420> they<00:03:24.690> had<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:24.960> brand<00:03:25.230> new

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
that's because they had these brand new

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.020 
that's because they had these brand new
uniforms<00:03:25.890> which<00:03:26.070> have<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.250> brand<00:03:26.490> new<00:03:26.610> symbol

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
uniforms which have a brand new symbol

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.850 
uniforms which have a brand new symbol
and<00:03:27.180> they're<00:03:27.570> not<00:03:27.750> too<00:03:28.170> different<00:03:28.440> from<00:03:28.680> their

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and they're not too different from their

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.100 
and they're not too different from their
alternate<00:03:29.340> costumes<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.970> mean<00:03:30.150> look<00:03:30.600> at<00:03:30.720> Vegeta
