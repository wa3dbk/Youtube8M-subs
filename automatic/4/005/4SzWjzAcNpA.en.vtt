 under the aegis of a certain wallemme sector that we know for having created 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.970
 series t to sex 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.189
 besides the influx of the frame in order to darken the universe 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.009
 usually 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 with a story based on a parallel world is located on the other side 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 a strange mirror 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.940
 this world of desolation to the outcry that it aims to eliminate edit to our 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.390
 mickey friend who's in play inadvertently spilled solvent on a 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 world map to orchestrated alain in south guyenne studio and who 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.110
 were working on creating an imaginary world the world I want 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 say 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.230
 this dissolution 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.170
 a postulate far from what we had before 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.500
 and that will allow us to discover the world of disney sub-men other 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 day 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 carrez picnic allows us to find the right number of characters 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.270
 familiar such as rabbits osvaldo the naughty patibular the pump 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.170
 side decor also one has the impression of being stolen in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 well known places reminiscent of disney theme parks 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 to save his world in perdition friendship has in his possession a brush 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 who will never leave the mount 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.590
 thanks to him our hero can not throw magic paint streams and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 which allow to reconstruct some of its decorative elements disappear 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.730
 or the expensive inverted solvent and that will erase the obstacles that 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.700
 hinder the progress of our rescue 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 practical way to discover new paths but also to make 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.479
 enemies two styles because the brush also has a detrimental effect on animals 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.479
 which is rather practical to defend oneself in this hostile world 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.880
 the picnic offers more libertine gameplay than usual ghassan haddad 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.250
 which serves as an open world 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.520
 from this one it is possible to chain the levels to advance 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.540
 in history but also performed some side quests that will inflate the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.709
 game life game 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.940
 but the titles to see the inspector also returns his first loves 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.410
 after 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.360
 with a lot of platform sequences reminiscent of the first 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 games released on megadrive and super Nintendo 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.419
 unfortunately what is technical and manipulative well the brush and knows 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.930
 defending against his enemies he has a little trouble jumping from platform to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.339
 another fault at a management of jumps a little hazardous at times 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.279
 the camera was also possible since it has both projects is 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.279
 its place never in the right place it would have been wiser to impose an angle 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.279
 in those moments to avoid such a disaster 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.769
 wimax is also hers with a precision that is not always 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.359
 appointments results we can sell too but it will take 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.769
 repeat several times to get to his ends what is often 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.009
 annoying especially in the heat of the action 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.320
 far from perfect 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.070
 and picnic offers however a pretty good rhythmic adventure 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.570
 and who will certainly amuse the women of the mascot of the uncle veil 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:15.699
