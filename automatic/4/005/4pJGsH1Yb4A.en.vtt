00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.159

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.499
 level and with rai is a species of the ex 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.359
 ap luis enrique came out of nowhere 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:45.020

 life will come back that will come yes the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.109
 activities at nicolas jose anigo then the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 brilliant jose anigo wanted to talk about 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.729
 his activities none is any word on 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.229
 an activity he's doing right now on 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.170
 an encrypted string so that I find that 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.159
 disgusting luis then I would say if 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.959
 I was bad languages ​​that's 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.119
 because it's a competing chain to 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.020
 yours a luis while it's not 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.619
 true there is no competition between 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.230
 his chiefs but well short I am adapted 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.090
 in any case I loved your question about 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.319
 joe to jose anigo that you asked josé 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.829

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.569
 marseille 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.150
 did you propose to patch 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.610
 trophy that awesome I imagined so hello 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.329
 hello yes jose anigo the young I saw 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 that they had an ad for a 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.340
 custody I was interested there for 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.079
 to participate nothing but wait for you 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.269
 rather, the formulas 24 48 hours 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.650
 ah well here is the formula 24 hours I the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.060
 know already been a lot that's spanking 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.019
 48 hours with the spot in the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.340
 mouth and the beating 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.380
 he told me he was happy 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.579
 relearn how to love very much I'll tell you 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.319
 put aside you look a step so 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.410
 I was going, sir diouf does not stop 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.959
 the problem or madam I do not know if 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.310
 it's true but it's next to lettuce 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.310
 your stamps to everyone 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.790
 I played well and thank you that gives him 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.650
 and we immediately go on with Julian 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.630
 cazarre luis l instant gaza is here but 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 there the paris of the galas the time that plays 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.300
 I'm pretty often pretty strong 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.860
 to give the good we did not say the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.700
 charlie rating that scores per capita 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.590
 and charlie who equalizes 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.920
 is how many mails its moorings not 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.150
 did you mention the golden talent ball 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.010
 I'm coming back to when from Ronaldo or 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.269
 messi there you were there yes because the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.100
 guys who owns mark and spends seven 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.989
 goals but you do it but there of course 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.790
 it's still gilbert you have it 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.260
 understood you understood it it's just 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.360
 and you watched that 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.680
 look at the goals it is this valley of ars 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.180
 a trick for the sales ranking of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.560
 jerseys it's the guys who sell 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.730
 jerseys it has nothing to do this is the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.440
 knows the development of cult of the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.459
 personality that you want 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.690
 did not understand that since the 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.860
 fifa bought it that's no longer called the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.500
 golden balloon we came to is called the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.360
 golden melon so excuse me the melon 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.980
 it's even the port and manual neuer 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.310
 he is not he is not there is not his 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.290
 square 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.239
 he is not level the golden ball 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.950
 it's ronaldo behind you have a melon 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.600
 of gold have a messiah case a big fat 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.769
 melon but it's not the same in my opinion 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.120
 the limit if we talked about the guys who 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.280
 can possibly catch up with them paul 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.470
 george lepp not the price relay the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.730
 yam 10 turnover potential that one you 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.320
 are right to melon outside want in 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.250
 Apart melon and gold I can 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.470
 to be landed in the next 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.329
 years and is not against the city hall 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.769
 is not quoted palmyre and excuse me 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.900
 he put misery to the best 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.120
 central defense of the world val town hall and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.229
 we do not have the palace excuse me it's 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.430
 which is good but who deserve to be 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.750
 quoted I think that at the same time want 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 ficals tonight they could be 2000 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.370
 and 1 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.350
 I think he'll do the same thing so 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.600
 naughty attention or and the golden melon 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.030
 besides why the psg in your opinion 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.680
 they kept van der wiel 1 and they have 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.870
 sold jallet is what I was going 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.240
 excuse me van der wiel yvan 88 cents 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.979
 thousand gold jersey in amsterdam 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.120
 see nothing that lived while I was going 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.260
 he sells not even forty thousand miles 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.860
 in the suburbs of cognac because he 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.330
 comes from cognac 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.710
 so excuse me I had there he has a 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.360
 head dolbec in the in the cities of gold 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.500
 of course ignores ben radios 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.300
 yes yeah remember the olmecs 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.440
 Ben and him it is one what are you 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.740
 want to do with it does not hold sell 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.419
 jerseys 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.530
 you know what is the guy sold the 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.800
 more jerseys on the last five 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.409
 years 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.169
 in your opinion gilbert says 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:10.089
 born dead no it's babu he even did 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:15.559
 flocking effect gift packages 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:16.069
 but it's not beautiful it's a cost that the 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.599
 good news 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.069
 the good news when we see all this 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.360
 is that we say that all these 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.319
 guys there do not look at league 1 them 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.789
 dishes that vote for the golden ball 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.959
 and that's just good news for 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.419
 they must do their shopping 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:30.469
 they prefer football it's a choice and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.969
 just to finish the psg it's when 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.319
 even in the last game he had 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.089
 still an opportunity to take the lead 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.289
 Well, we told them that's it 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.759
 opportunity to take the lead and they have 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.499
 successful are taken the head of laurent 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.479
 white has a vision well lend their edge 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:47.169
 I tell myself that maybe it's not bad 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.169
 love it that's great I finished
