it that maneuver so this is going to be

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.830 
it that maneuver so this is going to be
the<00:01:50.159> bottom<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.700> our<00:01:50.969> sorting<00:01:51.390> hat<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the bottom of our sorting hat with a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.959 
the bottom of our sorting hat with a
brim<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.170> our<00:01:52.439> sorting<00:01:52.890> hat<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> do

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
brim with our sorting hat and you do

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.779 
brim with our sorting hat and you do
want<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.359> be<00:01:54.420> quite<00:01:54.719> wide<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> you'll<00:01:56.640> see

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
want that to be quite wide so you'll see

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.279 
want that to be quite wide so you'll see
here<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.240> pulling<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.899> sorting

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
here I'm just pulling it now the sorting

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.459 
here I'm just pulling it now the sorting
hat<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> old<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.060> saggy<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
hat is very kind of old and saggy and so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.779 
hat is very kind of old and saggy and so
it<00:02:01.560> doesn't<00:02:01.859> need<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.249> perfect<00:02:02.670> circle

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
it doesn't need to be a perfect circle

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.639 
it doesn't need to be a perfect circle
which<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> why<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.509> opting<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.200> circle

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
which is why I'm not opting for a circle

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.980 
which is why I'm not opting for a circle
cutter<00:02:04.859> or<00:02:05.070> anything<00:02:05.249> like<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.850> this

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
it on the greaseproof paper though I'm

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.540 
it on the greaseproof paper though I'm
going<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:44.860> stick<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.040> straight<00:04:45.310> onto<00:04:45.460> the

going to stick it straight onto the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.910 
going to stick it straight onto the
cupcake<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.240> opted<00:04:46.840> for<00:04:46.870> bread<00:04:47.290> yellow<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
cupcake I opted for bread yellow and

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.950 
cupcake I opted for bread yellow and
blue<00:04:48.130> for<00:04:48.340> my<00:04:48.460> Harry<00:04:48.760> Potter<00:04:49.090> themed<00:04:49.450> cupcake

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
blue for my Harry Potter themed cupcake

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.750 
blue for my Harry Potter themed cupcake
because<00:04:50.140> Harry<00:04:50.500> Potter<00:04:50.770> scarf<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.400> red<00:04:51.610> and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
because Harry Potter scarf is red and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520 
because Harry Potter scarf is red and
yellow<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.780> snitch<00:04:52.990> lives<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.440> sky

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
yellow and the snitch lives in the sky

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.180 
yellow and the snitch lives in the sky
so<00:04:53.920> blue<00:04:54.100> seems<00:04:54.490> appropriate<00:04:55.920> so<00:04:56.920> I'm<00:04:57.040> just

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
so blue seems appropriate so I'm just

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.310 
so blue seems appropriate so I'm just
going<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.520> do<00:04:57.640> one<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:57.820> our<00:04:58.000> lovely<00:04:58.390> lo<00:04:58.780> swirls
