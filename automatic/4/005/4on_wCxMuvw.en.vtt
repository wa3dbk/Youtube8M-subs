00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
 everyone who uses a computer already 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 encountered expressions such as formatting and 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.639
 defragment but what they mean 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.009
 really and what happens on your disk 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 when you run some of these 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.330
 operations 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.640
 we prepared a dip in your hd to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.640
 explain all this to the company 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.250
 Do you know what it means to format your 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
 hd well when you buy a disc for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 your computer it comes virgin someone 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 you need to prepare this product for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 receive the operating system be it the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 windows mac or linux 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.950
 in practice, formatting creates tracks and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 sectors for information to be 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.059
 allocated in spaces easy to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 found later is as if you 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.719
 walls and shelves. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.260
 drawers to organize all the information 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.610
 on your computer 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 but if this is the first thing to do 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.420
 do on the computer and its manufacturers 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 already do so normally because some 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.460
 people format the answer again 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 It's as simple as at home. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 drawers become messy with the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.990
 time the computer is the same thing 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 If it's you, the doctor has gone through 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.159
 a virus situation or installed 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 uninstalled many applications this all 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.900
 leaving the fragmented machine going 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.659
 leaving orphaned files inside your 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.759
 windows operating system in case has 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.080
 a business called this record right 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.460
 windows registry has all the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
 information of everything that happened in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 machine since it was installed 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.289
 so sometimes installation and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 uninstallation for the common user it 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.440
 think he cleaned the machine she 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.539
 came back before 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.430
 we have several such cases not 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.229
 happens there with continued registration 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.810
 with references to archives 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.190
 that have already been deleted right and moreover 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.619
 remains fragmented even if you want 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.090
 Paying then depends a lot on the frequency 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.110
 formatting the usage of that user 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.149
 There you will hear some people. 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 saying that the more formatted the HD 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 the shorter the life of the equipment 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 This is not a lie, but it's also far away. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.509
 of being an absolute truth is that HD is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.159
 a mechanical part the wear and tear of the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.330
 needle in contact with the disk time 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.130
 whole is natural 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.019
 the more you use the disk more 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.820
 quickly it will deteriorate 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.290
 but this weariness does not only happen in the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.510
 formatting does not 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.040
 it happens every day with each reading 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.870
 or recording information 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.700
 so the better you take care of the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.150
 your hd plus it will last 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.459
 wants to know how the first care has the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 with the fragmentation of the disk has 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.760
 that you have installed a program 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.519
 it obviously occupy a space in your 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 hd after a few days you deleted it and 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.450
 the space for that program was 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.090
 empty on your disk only as soon as 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.200
 then you have installed another program 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.299
 computer will first occupy this 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.670
 empty space but the rest of the data 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.650
 will be filed somewhere else with 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.630
 the time the files on your disk becomes 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.000
 to be spread out on all sides 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.500
 and then the reading becomes more time consuming 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.239
 since the needle will be looking for 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.609
 pieces of information in spaces 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.070
 different from the disk for this on windows 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.819
 there is the defragmenter tool 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.609
 disco 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.469
 he goes there and picks up all the clusters 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.389
 neighbors of deleted files that you 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.040
 did and he gives a clean the future and 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.170
 organize files so they stay 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.269
 close to seeing you start in a 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.489
 file at the beginning says that the 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.500
 disc to the end for the rest 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.359
 you will see everything close and in a reading 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 makes it easier for you to see the 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.340
 machine gets faster 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.379
 another interesting tool that comes 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.389
 with windows itself is the scan says 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.370
 here it will scan the hd for 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.780
 clusters as if they were 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.489
 buried drawers 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.959
 this way it will warn the system 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.700
 to never use those 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.349
 compartments and then you will not lose 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.299
 more time and no archived data 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.189
 in that space on the disk has still 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.439
 system restore tool 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.090
 here the story is as follows you can 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.250
 program your computer to create 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.590
 copies of some important files in the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.959
 system at different times be 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.579
 daily weekly or as you 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.650
 prefer you have many resources of 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.750
 wrong peripherals on the machine sometimes 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.669
 It ends up creating a conflict why 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 made the camera the manufacturer made the bed not 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.220
 You know, you did not predict who 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.019
 making a printer drive and using the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.120
 same file is generating a conflict 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.900
 So you can get back in the records. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.370
 to order including as a hobby of gold 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.229
 if you prefer other programs 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.090
 free of charge cleaning the 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.900
 registry by deleting all commands 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 invalid 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.340
 cycling is one of them
