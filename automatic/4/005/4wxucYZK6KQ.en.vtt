00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.350
 and so good, okay everything cool 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.389
 it was the game was a little bit about tires 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.380
 my tires do not know how it will be 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.330
 my voice is my equipment was with 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 flautist now I took off for fashion 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 is to have a little bit higher 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.199
 I do not know how it all slows down. 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.690
 emanating from the boss is here with me 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 behind her motorcycle 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.990
 so check the vignette and this video 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.900
 offering wimax dot com network 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:46.650
 the home of accessories is asshole leaves a 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:50.970
 thing with hourly beauty are 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.500
 here with a second to see the team with 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.739
 Ten thousand four hundred and ninety 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.019
 kilometers going to the second 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 revision of the xj of 10 thousand has already 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.630
 A little more does not have to come to the play. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 even the small town fuck 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 but the tire from the rear to the rear is in the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 stage is a lot of people say that the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.690
 big bike lasts 5 thousand kilometers 6 thousand 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.540
 miles and I am proving that it depends 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 how you walk 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.480
 I give and 10,500 can say that it is not 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.420
 So bad, he's still starting to want to 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.060
 appear that middle metal screen 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.810
 not because it is not the first 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.960
 asks staff when there is xj6 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.970
 You're going to change the tire, it's good 180 if 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.590
 understanding does not know the width of the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 Tire width thickness're lagen watchman 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.759
 of the application the boy i because the people 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 on smaller motorcycles have mania to put the 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.740
 tire thicker than the peniche tire 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.890
 j 1 161 normal of these larger bikes 180 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.869
 and 190 but the most common is 80 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.030
 so what happens guys will paste 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.020
 with 180 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.360
 now what are the risks of others 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.680
 you put a thicker Mayan tire on the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.150
 your bike than the original factory is 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.280
 first the bike gets heavier tires 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.370
 it will get heavier for motorcycles 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.870
 This will spend the most on her relationship . 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.350
 will have one of the helmets 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.319
 premature wear of the relationship can be 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.590
 that it does not fit in its wheel that there is 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.950
 now 160 thousand tons is with 1,190 going to cost 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 enter if you enter then balloon and kaka is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.019
 thinner than the 160 because it will stay 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.850
 a biscuit understood 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.150
 also because it is heavier it will 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.530
 spend more fuel to spend more 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 fuel and 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.879
 The lady mistress, passing us without 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.610
 talk that will put your life at risk and the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.819
 worst of this deal put more tire 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.069
 wide is that to speak apa wider tire gives 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.319
 more tack that does not cause a 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.819
 motorcycle by putting a wider tire 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.500
 in her 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.470
 yes it will be the same bike is and will do with 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.859
 that he spends a lot in the middle that goes 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.109
 leave your tire square leaving your 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.090
 prolonged square will not lose the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.650
 because it will stay square and 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 go square 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.760
 there it was framed with the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.090
 ethanol to make curve it will lose 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.879
 finishing up by motorbike is essential 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.159
 that the tire is with caco I think it 's with 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.799
 the same speaks conversations with the wto concludes 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.579
 the same says the mistake do not be bend to 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.269
 to bend because the bike makes more curve 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:59.530
 do not lie down on the motorcycle than on the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.449
 handlebars is then okay when your life 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.780
 risk have to remember that the engine does 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:08.379
 fashion will be the frei makes the bike brake but the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.900
 Tire makes her speed and makes it stop the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.909
 tire is fucking important and noted 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.650
 if the boy still covered his life 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.400
 at risk for his girlfriend's life in 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.209
 risk 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.699
 you will see 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.889
 the format your mother your brother gerry mccann 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.819
 A lot of people left, but nothing 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.530
 I put it all the best for me. 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.349
 giving advice to you is what I 'm going to 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.490
 do I'll put the other 60 and all 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:36.289
 county that is right is mine because I 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.849
 I think I came back the possibility of someone 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.460
 I get to talk to you with a tire 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.039
 bigger that does not give anything greater that gives nothing 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.430
 he was rescued was framed goes 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.680
 make a curve falls and dies 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.750
 I would become weighed in the consciousness of 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.639
 to have done with you understood I would stay 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.699
 so man do you want 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.539
 and something else the original tire they live 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.360
 It 's in that way, but you trade for one. 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.090
 I do not know if it looks bigger 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.630
 depending on the way he was scratched 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.270
 I did not study until fat guy or thin 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.159
 and put on clothes will disguise even with 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.590
 tires and losing what looks bigger and 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.160
 everything else then this is the tip of today 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.320
 guys 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.590
 It is in a colloquium tire but thick 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.690
 You're not risking your life. 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.470
 the gas in May the whole of Motoca 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:35.700
 you because of esthetics is important is not the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.050
 size know how to use nÃ© made analogy but is 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.640
 more or less that same 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.000
 It's no use, there's only one big thing. 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.570
 knowing how to use is not really 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.090
 So a hug for you, take care.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.250
