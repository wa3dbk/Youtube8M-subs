by<00:00:06.000> Nick<00:00:06.180> Robinson<00:00:06.660> you'll<00:00:06.899> need<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.350> a4<00:00:07.710> sheet

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
by Nick Robinson you'll need an a4 sheet

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.680 
by Nick Robinson you'll need an a4 sheet
it's<00:00:08.429> low<00:00:08.639> intermediate<00:00:08.970> because<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.540> need

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
it's low intermediate because you need

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.780 
it's low intermediate because you need
to<00:00:09.809> fold<00:00:10.110> real<00:00:10.530> precise<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.160> get<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> good<00:00:11.550> plane

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
to fold real precise to get a good plane

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.690 
to fold real precise to get a good plane
and<00:00:12.200> don't<00:00:13.200> make<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> same<00:00:13.650> mistake<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.490> did

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and don't make the same mistake as I did

and don't make the same mistake as I did
don't<00:00:15.360> fly<00:00:15.630> when<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.020> windy<00:00:16.320> outside

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
don't fly when it's windy outside

don't fly when it's windy outside
indoors<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.820> plane<00:00:18.029> flies<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.840> well<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
indoors the plane flies really well on a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.670 
indoors the plane flies really well on a
straight<00:00:19.980> line<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:21.480> begin<00:00:21.960> by<00:00:22.320> folding

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
straight line and we begin by folding

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.730 
straight line and we begin by folding
the<00:00:23.070> sheet<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.519> half<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:26.660> then<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:28.140> open<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.619> up

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the sheet in half and then we open it up

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.760 
the sheet in half and then we open it up
to<00:00:29.490> mark<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.539> quarters<00:00:31.940> just<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.559> 1/3<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to mark the quarters just about 1/3 of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.600 
to mark the quarters just about 1/3 of
the<00:00:35.250> length<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> sheet<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:41.340> we'll

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the length of the sheet and now we'll

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
the length of the sheet and now we'll
fold<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.480> corner<00:00:44.450> from<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:46.039> mark<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.219> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
fold the corner from this mark we just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.529 
fold the corner from this mark we just
made<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.020> middle<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> sheet

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
made to the middle of the sheet

to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> mark<00:00:56.660> get<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> there

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
to the mark get to there

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.250 
to the mark get to there
same<00:01:00.860> thing<00:01:01.070> on<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.280> other<00:01:01.310> side<00:01:02.140> from<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
same thing on the other side from the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.230 
same thing on the other side from the
middle<00:01:03.680> line<00:01:03.860> up<00:01:04.810> to<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:07.310> quarter<00:01:07.820> mark<00:01:08.000> we

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
middle line up to the quarter mark we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.730 
middle line up to the quarter mark we
just<00:01:08.510> made<00:01:10.120> make<00:01:11.120> those<00:01:11.420> creases<00:01:11.780> count<00:01:12.170> if

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
just made make those creases count if

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.330 
just made make those creases count if
you<00:01:13.520> get<00:01:13.850> them<00:01:14.090> wrong<00:01:14.330> your<00:01:14.750> nose<00:01:15.050> will<00:01:15.340> be

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
you get them wrong your nose will be

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.609 
you get them wrong your nose will be
bent<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.700> one<00:01:17.540> or<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.750> other<00:01:17.990> side<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
bent to one or the other side and the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.760 
bent to one or the other side and the
plane<00:01:18.830> won't<00:01:19.010> fly<00:01:19.729> straight<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:20.450> now<00:01:20.960> fold<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
plane won't fly straight so now fold the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.930 
plane won't fly straight so now fold the
newly<00:01:22.190> folded<00:01:22.520> edge<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.540> center<00:01:23.960> line<00:01:24.140> on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
newly folded edge to the center line on

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.530 
newly folded edge to the center line on
both<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.330> heights<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:28.180> take<00:01:29.180> your<00:01:29.330> time

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
both of the heights and take your time

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:38.230 
both of the heights and take your time
for<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:35.770> see<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.800> need<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.340> adjust<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.880> folder

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
for that see I need to adjust the folder

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.180 
for that see I need to adjust the folder
also<00:01:40.810> symmetrical<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:42.320> key<00:01:43.220> here<00:01:44.140> okay<00:01:45.190> now

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
also symmetrical is key here okay now

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.889 
also symmetrical is key here okay now
fold<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.360> edge<00:01:47.539> to<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.860> center<00:01:49.490> once<00:01:49.910> more<00:01:50.240> on

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
fold the edge to the center once more on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.740 
fold the edge to the center once more on
both<00:01:51.680> fights<00:01:52.340> again<00:01:52.670> otherwise<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.509> wouldn't

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
both fights again otherwise it wouldn't

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.420 
both fights again otherwise it wouldn't
be<00:01:53.810> symmetrical<00:01:54.500> one<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.890> could<00:01:55.070> be<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> good

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
be symmetrical one that could be a good

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:07.139 
be symmetrical one that could be a good
plane

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:16.320 

now<00:02:08.149> we'll<00:02:08.930> open<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.649> up<00:02:09.710> again<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:14.200> fold

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
now we'll open that up again and fold

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220 
now we'll open that up again and fold
from<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.540> new<00:02:17.870> corner<00:02:18.380> there<00:02:19.900> along<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.110> edge

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
from the new corner there along the edge

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.710 
from the new corner there along the edge
and<00:02:21.590> make<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.950> parallel<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:23.000> fold<00:02:23.330> along

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and make it parallel so we fold along

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.550 
and make it parallel so we fold along
those<00:02:24.350> triangle<00:02:25.040> large<00:02:25.490> edges<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.360> make<00:02:27.290> sure

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
those triangle large edges and make sure

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.300 
those triangle large edges and make sure
that<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.540> newly<00:02:29.720> folded<00:02:30.260> edge<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.770> parallel

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
that the newly folded edge is parallel

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.400 
that the newly folded edge is parallel
to<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.550> other<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.420> rub<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.140> here

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
to the other one and now we rub it here

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.430 
to the other one and now we rub it here
the<00:02:33.680> whole<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.400> said<00:02:35.200> before<00:02:36.200> we

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the whole thing that we said before we

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.120 
the whole thing that we said before we
just<00:02:36.770> made<00:02:37.190> do<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:37.940> again<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:39.740> flap<00:02:39.980> in

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
just made do it again and the flap in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.240 
just made do it again and the flap in
the<00:02:40.220> middle<00:02:40.490> just<00:02:41.440> make<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.560> clear<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.010> now

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
the middle just make it clear and now

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.480 
the middle just make it clear and now
all<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:45.140> edges<00:02:45.440> should<00:02:45.470> align<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.250> one

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
all the edges should align to one

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.630 
all the edges should align to one
straight<00:02:46.850> line<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.840> see<00:02:48.020> here<00:02:48.400> when<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.520> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
straight line as you see here when it to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.660 
straight line as you see here when it to
the<00:02:49.760> left<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.420> right<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.870> now<00:02:51.670> fold

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
the left and to the right and now fold

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.430 
the left and to the right and now fold
that<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.720> half<00:02:54.040> again<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.140> squash-fold<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.590> so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
that in half again and squash-fold it so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.550 
that in half again and squash-fold it so
bring<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.310> edge<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.880> center<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.750> bring

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
bring the edge to the center and bring

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.890 
bring the edge to the center and bring
it<00:03:03.739> really<00:03:04.130> precisely<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> center<00:03:05.480> okay

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it really precisely to the center okay

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.729 
it really precisely to the center okay
now<00:03:06.800> what<00:03:07.010> we'll<00:03:07.220> do<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.390> petal<00:03:09.200> fold<00:03:09.230> for

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
now what we'll do is a petal fold for

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.490 
now what we'll do is a petal fold for
that<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.700> reinforce<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.720> creases<00:03:12.290> we

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
that we just reinforce the creases we

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.750 
that we just reinforce the creases we
already<00:03:12.890> made<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.239> tip<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.050> plane

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
already made and the tip of the plane

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.839 
already made and the tip of the plane
the<00:03:16.840> needle

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
the needle

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.280 
the needle
also<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.719> now<00:03:19.989> my<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.379> crease<00:03:20.890> here<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:23.109> make

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
also and now my get crease here to make

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.220 
also and now my get crease here to make
the<00:03:23.409> petal<00:03:23.709> fold<00:03:23.920> easier<00:03:25.319> now<00:03:28.139> unfold<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.370> tip

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the petal fold easier now unfold the tip

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.270 
the petal fold easier now unfold the tip
fold<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:33.510> forward<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:36.840> squash<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
fold it forward and squash the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.179 
fold it forward and squash the
right-hand<00:03:39.790> side<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.719> other<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.079> to

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.159 

take<00:03:45.189> your<00:03:45.340> time<00:03:45.519> it's<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:46.090> lot<00:03:46.389> of<00:03:46.510> layers<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
take your time it's a lot of layers that

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.709 
take your time it's a lot of layers that
are<00:03:47.459> intertwined<00:03:48.459> there<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:50.099> now<00:03:51.450> we<00:03:52.450> fold

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:52.719 
are intertwined there and now we fold

00:03:52.719 --> 00:04:01.349 
are intertwined there and now we fold
the<00:03:52.989> thing<00:03:53.290> off<00:03:59.219> you<00:04:00.219> seek<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.730> strong<00:04:01.060> crease

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
the thing off you seek a strong crease

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.220 
the thing off you seek a strong crease
there<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:02.919> bring<00:04:03.189> that<00:04:03.669> one

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
there we bring that one

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.369 
there we bring that one
to<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.370> bottom<00:04:09.480> tightly<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.599> it<00:04:10.750> goes<00:04:11.019> and

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
to the bottom tightly and it goes and

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.460 
to the bottom tightly and it goes and
make<00:04:12.159> another<00:04:12.430> crease<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.690> visage<00:04:14.080> goes

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
make another crease so the visage goes

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.599 
make another crease so the visage goes
to<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.890> one<00:04:15.959> same<00:04:16.959> thing<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.470> back<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.489> as

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
to that one same thing on the back so as

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.390 
to that one same thing on the back so as
you<00:04:21.760> can<00:04:21.940> see<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.720> creases<00:04:23.020> are<00:04:23.320> not<00:04:23.710> parallel

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
you can see the creases are not parallel

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.530 
you can see the creases are not parallel
to<00:04:24.669> anything<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:27.070> just<00:04:27.100> fold<00:04:27.970> edge<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.210> edge

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to anything you just fold edge to edge

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.220 
to anything you just fold edge to edge
here

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230
