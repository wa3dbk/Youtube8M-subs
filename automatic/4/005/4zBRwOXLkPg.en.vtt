yet have the pop that I'm used to in

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
yet have the pop that I'm used to in
like<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.460> traditional<00:00:56.460> camber<00:00:56.879> board<00:00:57.149> with

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
like a traditional camber board with

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
like a traditional camber board with
like<00:00:57.539> tons<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.170> carbon<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.309> field

rating<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.090> board<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> 4<00:01:01.020> so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
rating of this board is actually a 4 so

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
rating of this board is actually a 4 so
it's<00:01:01.320> quite<00:01:01.649> soft<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:03.090> there's<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.449> many

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's quite soft but there's so many

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
it's quite soft but there's so many
things<00:01:03.690> inside<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.589> make<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> nice<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
things inside of that make it nice and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.080 
things inside of that make it nice and
lively<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> bend<00:01:07.650> profile<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.369> flying<00:01:08.729> v

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

the<00:02:59.709> board<00:02:59.949> has<00:03:00.099> scooped<00:03:00.459> technology<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.299> a

the board has scooped technology and a

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.759 
the board has scooped technology and a
lip<00:03:01.540> kick<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.019> know<00:03:02.109> a<00:03:02.139> little<00:03:02.439> kick<00:03:02.620> sure

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
lip kick so you know a little kick sure

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.979 
lip kick so you know a little kick sure
the<00:03:02.949> ollie<00:03:03.400> platform<00:03:04.060> or<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.269> nose<00:03:04.419> platform

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
the ollie platform or the nose platform

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.319 
the ollie platform or the nose platform
and<00:03:05.169> then<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.859> scoop<00:03:06.159> actually<00:03:06.609> raises<00:03:07.150> up

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
and then the scoop actually raises up

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.670 
and then the scoop actually raises up
and<00:03:07.569> makes<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.959> nose<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.319> tail<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.560> little

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and makes the nose and the tail a little

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.979 
and makes the nose and the tail a little
bit<00:03:08.889> more<00:03:09.010> convex<00:03:09.609> so<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.269> easy<00:03:10.419> to<00:03:10.599> ride<00:03:10.810> in

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
bit more convex so it's easy to ride in

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.229 
bit more convex so it's easy to ride in
powder<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:11.709> easier<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.099> press<00:03:12.340> but

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
powder and it's easier to press but

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.119 
powder and it's easier to press but

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
that the glass and the carbon are at it
