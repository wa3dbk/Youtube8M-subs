00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
impression of such so it really tackles

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.340

you<00:00:58.250> know<00:00:58.340> what<00:00:58.910> what<00:00:59.600> it's<00:00:59.780> like<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.020> become<00:01:00.320> a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
fighter pilot in those in in war i guess

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.689 
fighter pilot in those in in war i guess
or<00:01:03.739> just<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.040> general<00:01:04.070> because<00:01:04.460> they<00:01:04.610> just

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
or just in general because they just

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.060 
or just in general because they just
didn't<00:01:05.080> didn't<00:01:06.080> really<00:01:06.260> have<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.470> technology

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
didn't didn't really have the technology

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.520 
didn't didn't really have the technology
to<00:01:07.100> kind<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.610> do<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.810> way<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.290> silent

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
to kind of do it that way it's a silent

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.400 
to kind of do it that way it's a silent
movie<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.820> was<00:01:11.060> made<00:01:11.090> even<00:01:11.690> after<00:01:12.290> the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
movie that was made even after the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.200 
movie that was made even after the
introduction<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.800> sound<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.430> barely<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.030> so

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
introduction of sound but barely so so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.460 
introduction of sound but barely so so
they<00:01:14.300> were<00:01:14.360> still<00:01:14.600> doing<00:01:14.720> sat<00:01:15.020> movies<00:01:15.320> back

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
they were still doing sat movies back

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.070 
they were still doing sat movies back
then<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.759> screen<00:01:17.180> debut<00:01:17.450> or<00:01:17.960> at

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
then and it is the screen debut or at

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.380 
then and it is the screen debut or at
least<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.530> first<00:01:18.740> notable<00:01:19.399> presence<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:20.000> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
least the first notable presence of a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.810 
least the first notable presence of a
young<00:01:20.720> Gary<00:01:21.020> Cooper<00:01:21.440> who<00:01:21.710> actually<00:01:22.040> shows<00:01:22.460> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
young Gary Cooper who actually shows a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.090 
young Gary Cooper who actually shows a
brief<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:23.660> very<00:01:23.720> stoic<00:01:24.259> performance<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.070> I

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
brief but very stoic performance and I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.410 
brief but very stoic performance and I
think<00:01:25.340> that's<00:01:25.550> kind<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:25.880> like<00:01:26.030> sets<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
think that's kind of like sets the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.570 
think that's kind of like sets the
ground<00:01:26.600> for<00:01:26.869> what<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.170> become<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:28.310> great

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
ground for what was to become the great

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.609 
ground for what was to become the great
movie<00:01:28.820> star<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.270> Gary<00:01:29.570> Cooper<00:01:29.990> although

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
movie star that is Gary Cooper although

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.380 
movie star that is Gary Cooper although
like<00:01:30.770> i<00:01:30.890> said<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.369> very<00:01:31.550> brief<00:01:31.820> performance

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
like i said it's very brief performance

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.670 
like i said it's very brief performance
it's<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.259> amazing<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.649> kind

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
it's just it's really amazing the kind

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.260 
it's just it's really amazing the kind
of<00:01:33.860> caliber<00:01:34.100> actor<00:01:34.399> that<00:01:34.430> guy<00:01:34.700> Cooper<00:01:34.910> is<00:01:35.090> that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
of caliber actor that guy Cooper is that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.850 
of caliber actor that guy Cooper is that
he<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.570> stands<00:01:35.899> out<00:01:36.080> in<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.500> very<00:01:36.770> short

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
he just stands out in a very short

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.590 
he just stands out in a very short
amount<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.430> time<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.820> perhaps<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.270> greatest

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
amount of time but perhaps the greatest

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600 
amount of time but perhaps the greatest
uniqueness<00:01:39.080> of<00:01:39.410> this<00:01:39.680> movie<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.399> fact

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

that<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.240> think<00:01:59.420> if<00:01:59.509> people<00:01:59.659> washed<00:02:00.080> it

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
that it is I think if people washed it

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.690 
that it is I think if people washed it
now<00:02:00.380> having<00:02:00.710> seen<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.100> lot<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.310> war<00:02:01.490> movies

now having seen a lot of war movies

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.070 
now having seen a lot of war movies
they'd<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:02.000> back<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.270> say<00:02:02.390> oh<00:02:02.540> well<00:02:02.869> that's

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
they'd look back and say oh well that's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.109 
they'd look back and say oh well that's
you<00:02:03.320> know<00:02:03.409> that's<00:02:03.460> conventional<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.729> Sony

really set the stage of that kind of of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.830

the perspective of the viewer it's very
suspenseful<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.230> suspense<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.380> kind<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.620> a

tough<00:02:21.860> thing<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.070> pull<00:02:22.310> off<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.579> a<00:02:22.670> silent<00:02:23.000> film

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
tough thing to pull off in a silent film

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.490 
tough thing to pull off in a silent film
when<00:02:23.450> people<00:02:23.660> talk<00:02:23.780> about<00:02:23.810> silent<00:02:24.260> movies

when people talk about silent movies

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.960 
when people talk about silent movies
they<00:02:24.620> think<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.280> young<00:02:25.549> completely

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.960 
they think that it's young completely
silent<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:26.720> that's<00:02:26.870> not<00:02:26.959> true<00:02:27.260> all<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
silent but that's not true all of the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.539 
silent but that's not true all of the

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
movies all the big-budget silent movies

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.280 
movies all the big-budget silent movies
had<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> score<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.540> accompanied<00:02:33.079> too<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
had a score that accompanied too and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.740 
had a score that accompanied too and
it's<00:02:33.410> usually<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.280> good<00:02:34.850> score<00:02:35.420> that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's usually you know a good score that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.120 
it's usually you know a good score that
is<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> part<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.440> storytelling<00:02:36.920> process

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
is a part of the storytelling process

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.890 
is a part of the storytelling process
and<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.850> think<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.329> general<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.840> an

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
and I think just in general for an

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300 
and I think just in general for an
audience<00:02:39.079> who's<00:02:39.350> generally<00:02:39.620> interested<00:02:40.190> in

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
audience who's generally interested in

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.550 
audience who's generally interested in
film<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.269> should<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.690> giving<00:02:41.989> sonic<00:02:42.290> movies<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
film you should be giving sonic movies a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.199 
film you should be giving sonic movies a
chance<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.430> I'll<00:02:43.549> be<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> first<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.000> say<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
chance and I'll be the first to say that

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.300 
chance and I'll be the first to say that
I<00:02:44.360> wasn't<00:02:44.900> always<00:02:45.049> one<00:02:45.680> who<00:02:45.829> was<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.280> I
