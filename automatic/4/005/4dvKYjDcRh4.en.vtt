00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
temperature and then drop into it from

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.090 
temperature and then drop into it from
the<00:04:34.090> top<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:35.110> way<00:04:35.260> when<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.560> load<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.770> meat

on then cool cooker down you have a
recovery<00:04:38.650> issue<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.690> cooker<00:04:41.050> will

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
recovery issue just this cooker will

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.870 
recovery issue just this cooker will
cook<00:04:41.350> real<00:04:41.560> fine<00:04:41.860> when<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.310> throw<00:04:42.490> some<00:04:42.700> meat

all country went to there's plenty of
air<00:04:53.430> get<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.000> fire<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.480> get<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.630> story

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
air get to the fire to get a story

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.510 
air get to the fire to get a story
look<00:04:56.460> how<00:04:56.550> clear<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.970> smokestack<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:58.520> we've

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
look how clear the smokestack is we've

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.160 
look how clear the smokestack is we've
got<00:04:59.640> some<00:04:59.820> heat<00:05:00.030> there<00:05:00.060> now<00:05:00.480> we<00:05:00.840> can<00:05:00.960> start

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
got some heat there now we can start

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.710 
got some heat there now we can start
thinking<00:05:01.290> about<00:05:01.620> cooking<00:05:01.860> you're<00:05:02.640> at<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.850> 300

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
thinking about cooking you're at a 300

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.960 
thinking about cooking you're at a 300
degrees<00:05:04.070> your<00:05:05.070> heat<00:05:05.370> jumping<00:05:05.760> out<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
degrees your heat jumping out of that

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.480 
degrees your heat jumping out of that
smokestack<00:05:06.590> now<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.650> got<00:05:07.950> something<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.340> work

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
smokestack now you got something to work

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.390 
smokestack now you got something to work
with<00:05:09.110> as<00:05:10.110> they<00:05:10.380> say<00:05:10.590> there's<00:05:10.800> somebody<00:05:11.010> home

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
with as they say there's somebody home

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
with as they say there's somebody home
now<00:05:13.280> now<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.400> temperature<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.910> gonna<00:05:15.060> run<00:05:15.270> on

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
now now this temperature is gonna run on

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.360 
now now this temperature is gonna run on
up<00:05:15.630> it's<00:05:15.840> gonna<00:05:15.960> go<00:05:16.140> away<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.320> past<00:05:16.740> here<00:05:17.100> in<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
up it's gonna go away on past here in a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.740 
up it's gonna go away on past here in a
few<00:05:17.520> minutes<00:05:17.670> will<00:05:17.970> knock<00:05:18.180> all<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.510> fire

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
few minutes will knock all that fire

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.450 
few minutes will knock all that fire
down<00:05:19.020> in<00:05:19.230> that<00:05:19.380> box<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.950> we'll<00:05:20.070> have<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.220> real

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
down in that box and we'll have a real
