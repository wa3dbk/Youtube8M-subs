00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
today's video is just about how you can

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.420 
today's video is just about how you can
succeed<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.300> level<00:00:03.600> biology<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:05.250> is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
succeed in a level biology and this is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.780 
succeed in a level biology and this is
for<00:00:05.730> all<00:00:05.879> examples<00:00:06.540> so<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.960> QA<00:00:07.290> or<00:00:07.560> co-ed<00:00:08.160> excel

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
for all examples so a QA or co-ed excel

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
for all examples so a QA or co-ed excel
whatever<00:00:09.450> you're<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.290> did<00:00:10.530> also<00:00:10.679> yeah

whatever you're on and I did also yeah
that<00:00:11.340> might<00:00:11.730> relate<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.210> bit<00:00:12.540> more<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:13.080> feel

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that might relate a bit more to or feel

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.829 
that might relate a bit more to or feel
and<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> others<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.460> also<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.059> s<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.570> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and the others it's also for a s and a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
and the others it's also for a s and a
to<00:00:15.900> biology<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.830> don't<00:00:17.010> worry<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.430> as

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
to biology so don't worry about that as

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
to biology so don't worry about that as
well<00:00:20.240> first<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.600> need<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:22.050> I'd<00:00:22.320> say

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
single point on their face that is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240 
single point on their face that is
everything<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> beginning<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
everything like from the beginning to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the end everything that they can test

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.950 
the end everything that they can test
you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.110
