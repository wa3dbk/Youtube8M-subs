welcome back to another build tutorial
today<00:00:13.139> we're<00:00:13.380> not<00:00:13.500> gonna<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.769> building<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
today we're not gonna be building a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.510 
today we're not gonna be building a
house<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.059> vehicle<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.379> guess<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> could

house but a vehicle so I guess you could

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.540 
house but a vehicle so I guess you could
call<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> vehicle<00:00:18.270> tutorial<00:00:18.690> anyways

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
call this a vehicle tutorial anyways

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
call this a vehicle tutorial anyways
today<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:21.810> building<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
today we are going to be building a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
today we are going to be building a
moving<00:00:22.890> truck<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.369> basically<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> name<00:00:24.449> says

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
moving truck and basically the name says

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.599 
moving truck and basically the name says
it<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.350> truck<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.890> move<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it all it's a truck that you move a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
it all it's a truck that you move a
bunch<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:28.039> whatever<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.220> need<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> move<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
bunch of whatever you need to move to a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.420 
bunch of whatever you need to move to a
different<00:00:29.970> location<00:00:30.740> I'm<00:00:31.740> sure<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> us

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
different location I'm sure all of us

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.540 
different location I'm sure all of us
have<00:00:32.610> used<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.059> before<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:34.280> anyways<00:00:35.280> let's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
have used one before and anyways let's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
have used one before and anyways let's
get<00:00:35.670> started<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:36.840> gonna<00:00:36.899> need<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
get started so what we're gonna need is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.970 
get started so what we're gonna need is
some<00:00:37.380> quartz<00:00:37.890> blocks<00:00:38.730> stairs<00:00:39.329> slabs<00:00:39.980> whatever

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
some quartz blocks stairs slabs whatever

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
some quartz blocks stairs slabs whatever
color<00:00:41.280> block<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.840> yellow

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
color block you want it could be yellow

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.250 
color block you want it could be yellow
red<00:00:43.379> whatever<00:00:44.120> some<00:00:45.120> sort<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> black<00:00:45.629> block

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
red whatever some sort of black block

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080 
red whatever some sort of black block
and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.430> used<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:47.820> tires

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and this is gonna be used for our tires

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
and this is gonna be used for our tires
so<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.170> case<00:00:49.379> we're<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.829> block<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
so in this case we're using a block of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.990 
so in this case we're using a block of
coal<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> need<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.730> glass

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
coal and you're gonna need some glass

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.840 
coal and you're gonna need some glass
blocks<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.809> class<00:00:55.079> panes<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.340> ladder<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
blocks some class panes and a ladder and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.069 
blocks some class panes and a ladder and
this<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.559> essential<00:00:59.750> blocks<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.960> build

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
this is the essential blocks to build

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.740 
this is the essential blocks to build
the<00:01:01.559> main<00:01:01.920> part<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> truck<00:01:02.550> already<00:01:03.539> let's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the main part of the truck already let's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
the main part of the truck already let's
get<00:01:03.870> started<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.450> what<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.540> gonna<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.869> I'm

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
get started so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
get started so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:01:07.049> place<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> tires<00:01:07.830> three<00:01:08.520> blocks<00:01:08.700> wide

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
gonna place the tires three blocks wide

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.890 
gonna place the tires three blocks wide
like<00:01:09.360> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
like so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.920 
like so
that's<00:01:10.200> such<00:01:10.380> width<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> truck<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.930> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that's such width of the truck and you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
that's such width of the truck and you
can<00:01:13.049> set<00:01:13.229> whatever<00:01:13.409> length<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
can set whatever length you want for the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
can set whatever length you want for the
truck<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.650> case<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> guess<00:01:19.490> six<00:01:20.490> blocks

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
truck in this case I guess six blocks

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
truck in this case I guess six blocks
wide<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:22.130> let's<00:01:23.130> call<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.549> B<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:25.320> called

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
wide and let's call this B it's called

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.340 
wide and let's call this B it's called
this<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.890> front<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.700> truck<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> I'll

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this the front of the truck so I'll

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.690 
this the front of the truck so I'll
place<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.829> upside<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:29.759> stare<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
place it up upside down stare like so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
place it up upside down stare like so
stare<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.850> its<00:01:33.030> side<00:01:33.710> stare<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> other

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
stare on its side stare on the other

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.390 
stare on its side stare on the other
side<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.049> then<00:01:37.049> we'll<00:01:37.170> place<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.680> quartz<00:01:38.130> block

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
side and then we'll place a quartz block

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.030 
side and then we'll place a quartz block
right<00:01:38.729> behind<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> tire<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.740> on<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> other

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
right behind the tire and on the other

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.550 
right behind the tire and on the other
side<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.430> well

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
side as well

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.639 
side as well
whatever<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.159> build<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.649> copy

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
whatever you do on this build you copy

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.899 
whatever you do on this build you copy
it<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> other<00:01:47.100> side<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.729> be

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it to the other side so it's gonna be

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.990 
it to the other side so it's gonna be
symmetrical<00:01:48.360> when<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> look<00:01:48.689> down<00:01:50.000> through

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
symmetrical when you look down through

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.469 
symmetrical when you look down through
the<00:01:51.119> truck<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.229> pretty<00:01:52.350> simple<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.479> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the truck so it's pretty simple and this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
the truck so it's pretty simple and this
is<00:01:54.540> basically<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.740> main<00:01:56.040> chassis<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
is basically the main chassis of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.959 
is basically the main chassis of the
truck<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.320> easy<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.619> build

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
truck which is really easy to build

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.249 
truck which is really easy to build
after<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.360> block<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.110> just

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
after that one block we're gonna just

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
after that one block we're gonna just
use<00:02:01.439> upside<00:02:01.799> down<00:02:02.009> stairs<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
use upside down stairs all the to the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.520 
use upside down stairs all the to the
back<00:02:04.320> tires<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
back tires like so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.950 
back tires like so
and<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.880> do<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.180> on<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.600> side<00:02:09.840> as

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
and just do that on the other side as

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.470 
and just do that on the other side as
well<00:02:11.240> then<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:15.060> we're<00:02:15.240> going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:17.480> we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
well then what we're going to do is we

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.610 
well then what we're going to do is we
are<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.260> fill<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.620> quartz

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
are going to fill this up with a quartz

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.340 
are going to fill this up with a quartz
block<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:26.210> we<00:02:27.210> are<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> do<00:02:28.110> this

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
block and then we are going to do this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
block and then we are going to do this
this<00:02:28.830> place<00:02:29.280> more<00:02:29.520> quartz<00:02:29.880> blocks<00:02:30.120> above<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this place more quartz blocks above the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
this place more quartz blocks above the
first<00:02:32.630> layer<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:36.080> do<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
first layer like so and do that on the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.410 
first layer like so and do that on the
other<00:02:37.590> side<00:02:37.680> as<00:02:37.950> well<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:40.700> now<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:41.760> are<00:02:42.240> going

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
other side as well and now we are going

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.560 
other side as well and now we are going
to<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.780> our<00:02:43.080> colored<00:02:43.770> block<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:45.240> front<00:02:45.480> of

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
to use our colored block in the front of

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.120 
to use our colored block in the front of
the<00:02:45.630> truck<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:49.680> are<00:02:49.709> actually

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the truck like so and we are actually

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.500 
the truck like so and we are actually
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.490> place<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.360> window<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
going to place the window right here and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.100 
going to place the window right here and
most<00:02:54.750> trucks<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:57.360> call<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.690> most

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
most trucks have what you call it most

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.860 
most trucks have what you call it most
trucks<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:59.510> extruding<00:03:00.510> there<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.780> go

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
trucks have extruding there we go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
trucks have extruding there we go
extruding<00:03:01.670> extruding<00:03:02.670> out<00:03:02.820> mirrors<00:03:03.740> well<00:03:04.740> of

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
extruding extruding out mirrors well of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.640 
extruding extruding out mirrors well of
course<00:03:05.040> all<00:03:05.340> cars<00:03:05.610> do<00:03:05.820> but<00:03:06.530> trucks<00:03:07.530> have

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
course all cars do but trucks have

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.340 
course all cars do but trucks have
bigger<00:03:07.830> ones<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:08.820> looks<00:03:08.940> bigger<00:03:09.350> so

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
bigger ones so this one looks bigger so

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.290 
bigger ones so this one looks bigger so
we're<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> then

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
we're just going to do that and then

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.800 
we're just going to do that and then
we're<00:03:12.450> gonna<00:03:12.600> use<00:03:12.810> our<00:03:13.019> color<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.769> block<00:03:14.010> again

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
we're gonna use our color to block again

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.300 
we're gonna use our color to block again
to<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.550> go<00:03:17.550> around<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:19.470> truck<00:03:19.830> right<00:03:20.100> here

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to just go around the truck right here

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.150 
to just go around the truck right here
this<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.730> give<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> more<00:03:21.209> exiting<00:03:22.160> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
this is to give it a more exiting and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.479 
this is to give it a more exiting and
you<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.630> third<00:03:24.930> layer

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
you just you do this on the third layer

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.910 
you just you do this on the third layer
same<00:03:26.489> layer<00:03:26.730> as<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:28.250> glass<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.050> add

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
same layer as the glass and then add

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.759 
same layer as the glass and then add
another<00:03:32.370> layer<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:33.060> quartz<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.750> top<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.680> this

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
another layer of quartz on top and this

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.520 
another layer of quartz on top and this
one's<00:03:34.980> gonna<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.280> above<00:03:35.820> over<00:03:36.480> above<00:03:37.380> of

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
one's gonna be above over above of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.500 
one's gonna be above over above of
course<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:37.920> over<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.519> windows<00:03:38.850> as<00:03:39.060> well<00:03:39.239> like

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
course but over the windows as well like

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
course but over the windows as well like
so<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:41.040> then<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.250> cover<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:44.370> then

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
so and then just cover it up and then

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.949 
so and then just cover it up and then
we're<00:03:44.610> gonna<00:03:44.730> actually<00:03:44.970> use<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.690> half

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
we're gonna actually use these half

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.400 
we're gonna actually use these half
slabs<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:48.209> make<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.600> top<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> little<00:03:49.110> more

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
slabs to make this top a little more

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.070 
slabs to make this top a little more
thicker<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.910> doesn't<00:03:51.120> make<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.330> car<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
thicker so it doesn't make that car the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.070 
thicker so it doesn't make that car the
truck<00:03:52.320> actually<00:03:52.739> look<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.750> little<00:03:54.750> awkward

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
truck actually look a little awkward

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.280 
truck actually look a little awkward
looking<00:03:56.180> there<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:57.269> go<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.720> then<00:03:57.959> what<00:03:58.170> we're

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
looking there we go and then what we're

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.560 
looking there we go and then what we're
gonna<00:03:58.380> do<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.709> we're<00:03:58.830> going<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.010> actually

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
gonna do is we're going to actually

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.880 
gonna do is we're going to actually
extend<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.720> back<00:04:00.900> out<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:03.060> let's<00:04:03.540> see

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
extend the back out a bit so let's see

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.449 
extend the back out a bit so let's see
like<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:06.590> like<00:04:07.590> there<00:04:07.799> right<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.070> we<00:04:08.130> go<00:04:08.250> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
like so like there right there we go and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.259 
like so like there right there we go and
then<00:04:08.760> what<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.390> place<00:04:09.799> another<00:04:11.269> layer

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
then what actually place another layer

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.720 
then what actually place another layer
right<00:04:12.810> here

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
right here

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.280 
right here
there<00:04:15.730> we<00:04:15.819> go<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.150> that's<00:04:19.690> basically<00:04:20.169> the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
there we go and that's basically the

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.480 
there we go and that's basically the
main<00:04:21.010> part<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.639> truck<00:04:22.060> oh<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.460> course

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
main part of the truck oh and of course

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.000 
main part of the truck oh and of course
you<00:04:24.729> use<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.300> ladders<00:04:25.660> right<00:04:25.930> here<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.889> it

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
you use the ladders right here so it

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.530 
you use the ladders right here so it
looks<00:04:27.190> like<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.550> grill<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:28.000> front<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> car

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
looks like we grill in front of the car

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.070 
looks like we grill in front of the car
and<00:04:32.040> that's<00:04:33.040> about<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.970> basic<00:04:34.449> now<00:04:35.020> we

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
and that's about it for the basic now we

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.930 
and that's about it for the basic now we
got<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> decorate<00:04:35.800> that's<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.310> fun<00:04:36.520> part<00:04:36.760> of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
got a decorate that's the fun part of

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.990 
got a decorate that's the fun part of
vehicles<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:39.250> for<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.669> one<00:04:39.880> we're

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
vehicles so I think for this one we're

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.930 
vehicles so I think for this one we're
going<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.180> actually<00:04:40.360> use<00:04:41.610> some<00:04:42.610> item<00:04:42.940> frames

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:05:01.650 

red<00:04:48.940> little<00:04:52.320> yellow<00:04:53.320> wool<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:57.600> door<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:01.120> a

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
red little yellow wool and a door and a

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.840 
red little yellow wool and a door and a
lever<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:05.460> buttons<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.340> think<00:05:09.490> we're<00:05:09.610> good

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
ready and basically this is the

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.790

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
pretty simple to make if you don't have

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.930 
pretty simple to make if you don't have
enough<00:07:29.139> courts<00:07:29.530> I<00:07:29.740> guess<00:07:30.370> you<00:07:30.520> could<00:07:30.669> do<00:07:30.789> it

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
enough courts I guess you could do it

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.629 
enough courts I guess you could do it
some<00:07:31.120> other<00:07:31.210> material<00:07:31.780> but<00:07:32.219> courts<00:07:33.219> just

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
some other material but courts just

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.990 
some other material but courts just
looks<00:07:33.969> better<00:07:34.479> in<00:07:34.870> my<00:07:35.020> opinion<00:07:35.139> and<00:07:35.789> of<00:07:36.789> course

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
looks better in my opinion and of course

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.999 
looks better in my opinion and of course
you<00:07:37.060> can<00:07:37.150> use<00:07:37.300> different<00:07:37.479> colors<00:07:37.930> but<00:07:38.800> in<00:07:38.919> this

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009 
you can use different colors but in this

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.909 
you can use different colors but in this
