00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609 

the<00:00:20.500> idea<00:00:20.800> of<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.310> teaching<00:00:21.880> picture<00:00:22.839> was

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
the idea of a teaching picture was

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.230 
the idea of a teaching picture was
really<00:00:23.920> central<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.429> rudy's<00:00:25.000> work<00:00:26.939> he<00:00:27.939> used<00:00:28.150> to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
really central to rudy's work he used to

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.120 
really central to rudy's work he used to
sit<00:00:28.480> in<00:00:28.509> his<00:00:28.750> own<00:00:28.900> store<00:00:29.289> with<00:00:29.529> pictures<00:00:29.980> of

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
sit in his own store with pictures of

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.670 
sit in his own store with pictures of
his<00:00:30.279> teachers<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:31.079> you<00:00:32.079> could<00:00:32.259> tell<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:32.649> he

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
his teachers and you could tell that he

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.410 
his teachers and you could tell that he
would<00:00:32.950> look<00:00:33.070> at<00:00:33.219> them<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.700> time<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.210> draw

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
would look at them all the time and draw

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.740 
would look at them all the time and draw
energy<00:00:34.629> from<00:00:34.840> them<00:00:35.200> and<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.520> he<00:00:36.730> made<00:00:37.539> it<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
energy from them and so he made it a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.139 
energy from them and so he made it a
conscious<00:00:38.649> effort<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:39.190> have<00:00:39.699> pictures<00:00:40.120> of

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
conscious effort to have pictures of

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.840 
conscious effort to have pictures of
himself<00:00:40.390> taken<00:00:41.140> for<00:00:41.739> us<00:00:41.829> his<00:00:42.039> students<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> use
