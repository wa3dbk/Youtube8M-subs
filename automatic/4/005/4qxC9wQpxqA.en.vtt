00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
stretch out parts of the figure like

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.340 
stretch out parts of the figure like
this<00:02:54.590> see<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:56.030> make<00:02:56.150> his<00:02:56.270> arm<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.810> long<00:02:57.110> or

stick figure if you want it to look more
realistic<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.410> might<00:03:21.590> want<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.860> kind<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.430> up

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
realistic you might want to kind of up

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.220 
realistic you might want to kind of up
thickness<00:03:23.210> of<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.540> your<00:03:23.870> lines<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.620> such<00:03:26.230> the

way<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.410> kind<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:27.950> start<00:03:28.190> out<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.460> I<00:03:28.580> usually

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
way I kind of start out is I usually

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.060 
way I kind of start out is I usually
just<00:03:28.970> build<00:03:29.510> up<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> body<00:03:29.960> and<00:03:30.140> then<00:03:30.890> I'll

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
just build up the body and then I'll

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.380 
just build up the body and then I'll
start<00:03:31.340> adding<00:03:31.550> on<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.090> arms<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:34.180> good<00:03:35.180> way<00:03:35.360> to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
start adding on the arms a good way to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.750 
start adding on the arms a good way to
make<00:03:35.990> sure<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.530> your<00:03:36.680> arms<00:03:36.890> or<00:03:37.220> legs<00:03:37.250> are

symmetrical is to first draw one of the
arms<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:43.570> then<00:03:44.570> down<00:03:44.810> here<00:03:44.840> where<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.560> see

arms and then down here where you see
there's<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:47.120> button<00:03:47.360> with<00:03:47.570> two<00:03:47.870> lines<00:03:48.140> on

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
there's to the button with two lines on

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.800 
there's to the button with two lines on
it<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:49.100> click<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.820> what<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.780> a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
copy button and this makes sure

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.250 
copy button and this makes sure
everything<00:03:54.500> stays<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.610> same<00:03:56.210> so<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:57.140> way

androids<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:44.210> I've<00:06:45.210> made<00:06:45.509> a<00:06:45.539> few<00:06:45.659> stick

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
androids and I've made a few stick

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.470 
androids and I've made a few stick
figures<00:06:46.379> like<00:06:46.589> this<00:06:46.800> um

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
figures like this um

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.690 
figures like this um
I<00:06:47.600> haven't<00:06:48.170> really<00:06:48.350> done<00:06:49.040> anything<00:06:49.340> with<00:06:49.610> the

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
I haven't really done anything with the

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.280 
I haven't really done anything with the
detail<00:06:50.060> button<00:06:50.360> much<00:06:50.510> but<00:06:50.990> I<00:06:51.020> am

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
detail button much but I am

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.380 
detail button much but I am
experimenting<00:06:51.710> with<00:06:52.040> that<00:06:52.310> and<00:06:52.550> if<00:06:53.060> I<00:06:53.180> have

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
experimenting with that and if I have

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.030 
experimenting with that and if I have
more<00:06:53.630> on<00:06:53.780> it<00:06:53.900> I<00:06:54.020> will<00:06:54.230> probably<00:06:54.470> let<00:06:54.740> you<00:06:54.800> guys

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
more on it I will probably let you guys

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.480 
more on it I will probably let you guys
know<00:06:55.280> about<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:56.140> but<00:06:57.140> anyway<00:06:57.830> this<00:06:58.310> is

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
know about it but anyway this is

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.610 
know about it but anyway this is
basically<00:06:58.850> how<00:06:59.120> you<00:06:59.150> use<00:06:59.510> it<00:06:59.540> once<00:07:00.440> you're

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
basically how you use it once you're

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.480 
basically how you use it once you're
finished<00:07:00.800> you<00:07:01.370> go<00:07:01.520> to<00:07:01.580> file<00:07:02.090> save<00:07:03.100> save<00:07:04.100> as<00:07:04.310> or

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
finished you go to file save save as or

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.330 
finished you go to file save save as or
add<00:07:04.670> to<00:07:04.700> animation<00:07:05.390> when<00:07:05.900> you<00:07:06.020> save<00:07:06.260> as<00:07:06.530> of

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
add to animation when you save as of

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.490 
add to animation when you save as of
course<00:07:07.670> you<00:07:07.790> get<00:07:07.910> the<00:07:08.060> box<00:07:08.270> you<00:07:08.900> type<00:07:08.930> in<00:07:09.410> a

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
course you get the box you type in a

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.640 
course you get the box you type in a
name<00:07:09.680> and<00:07:09.980> it<00:07:10.370> always<00:07:10.550> says<00:07:10.820> it<00:07:11.000> as<00:07:11.120> a<00:07:11.180> dot<00:07:11.650> STK

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
name and it always says it as a dot STK

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.070 
name and it always says it as a dot STK
or<00:07:12.890> stick<00:07:13.370> figure<00:07:13.670> file<00:07:13.910> and<00:07:14.180> that's<00:07:14.900> only

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
or stick figure file and that's only

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.810 
or stick figure file and that's only
readable<00:07:15.530> by<00:07:15.680> pivot<00:07:16.100> it<00:07:16.220> will<00:07:16.250> not<00:07:16.580> work<00:07:16.610> with

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
readable by pivot it will not work with

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.350 
readable by pivot it will not work with
anything<00:07:17.480> else<00:07:17.690> or<00:07:18.020> you<00:07:19.010> can<00:07:19.130> just<00:07:19.310> go<00:07:19.940> to<00:07:19.970> add

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
anything else or you can just go to add

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.920 
anything else or you can just go to add
to<00:07:20.600> animation<00:07:21.260> and<00:07:21.910> you<00:07:22.910> just<00:07:23.180> give<00:07:23.600> it<00:07:23.720> a<00:07:23.780> name

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
to animation and you just give it a name

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.720 
to animation and you just give it a name
and<00:07:23.990> it's<00:07:24.290> automatically<00:07:24.830> in<00:07:25.010> your<00:07:25.160> animation

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:25.730 
and it's automatically in your animation

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.400 
and it's automatically in your animation
you<00:07:25.850> don't<00:07:26.030> save<00:07:26.480> it<00:07:26.690> or<00:07:26.780> anything<00:07:26.990> it's<00:07:27.320> just

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
you don't save it or anything it's just

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.250 
you don't save it or anything it's just
for<00:07:28.190> that<00:07:28.220> animation<00:07:28.880> you<00:07:29.780> can't<00:07:29.990> really<00:07:30.140> open

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
for that animation you can't really open

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.160 
for that animation you can't really open
it<00:07:30.590> up<00:07:30.710> on<00:07:30.890> any<00:07:31.070> other<00:07:31.280> animation<00:07:31.940> unless<00:07:32.900> you

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.170 
it up on any other animation unless you

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.290 
it up on any other animation unless you
save<00:07:33.470> it<00:07:33.650> as<00:07:33.890> a<00:07:33.950> completely<00:07:34.700> different<00:07:35.060> stick

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
save it as a completely different stick

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.220 
save it as a completely different stick
figure<00:07:35.570> file<00:07:36.010> now<00:07:37.010> there's<00:07:37.250> always<00:07:37.550> a<00:07:37.730> way<00:07:37.880> to

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230 
figure file now there's always a way to

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.930 
figure file now there's always a way to
recover<00:07:39.230> a<00:07:39.560> stick<00:07:39.830> figure<00:07:39.950> file<00:07:40.310> that<00:07:40.550> you<00:07:40.670> put

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940 
recover a stick figure file that you put

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.850 
recover a stick figure file that you put
into<00:07:41.090> an<00:07:41.330> animation<00:07:42.100> and<00:07:43.480> as<00:07:44.480> you<00:07:44.630> can<00:07:44.780> see<00:07:44.860> the

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:45.860 
into an animation and as you can see the

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.520 
into an animation and as you can see the
static<00:07:46.250> part<00:07:46.490> is<00:07:46.670> not<00:07:46.820> moving<00:07:47.210> and<00:07:47.360> it<00:07:47.900> is<00:07:47.930> way

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.530 
static part is not moving and it is way

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.620 
static part is not moving and it is way

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:50.630 
taller than I expected that's another

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.980 
taller than I expected that's another
thing<00:07:50.840> you<00:07:50.960> have<00:07:51.080> to<00:07:51.140> watch<00:07:51.320> the<00:07:51.680> size<00:07:52.480> if<00:07:53.480> you

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:53.990
