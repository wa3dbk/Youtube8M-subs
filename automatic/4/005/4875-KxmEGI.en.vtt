00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 I am a soldier loner in the Israeli army I 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.550
 serving in the one hundred and first battalion 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.550

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.739

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.809
 I had the choice to go for a year and a half or 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.670
 go for three years I decided to do the full 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.320
 service because i think that if u 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 serve in the army so serve as it should 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.859
 when I came here I asked 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.309
 participation in the selection for the service 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.979

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.690
 truly honest how we can 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.690
 how our fathers served 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.270
 about a year ago I called my 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.409
 good friend and asked me 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.789

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.960
 Equipped in this regard I told you that 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.270
 real housing me especially not 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.039
 satisfied and he offered me participation in 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.600
 a project for solitary soldiers who 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.880
 serve as combat units of the Israeli army 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.709
 called warm home essence we 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.060
 are the pioneers of this 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.880
 the program that is the first participants 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.950
 we have a tel aviv apartment there 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.259
 did they give us a three-room 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 apartment in the north of tel aviv in 5 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.239
 minutes walk from the sea is very important 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.039
 very convenient because when we 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.770
 returning from the army do not have to think 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.979

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.890

 there is no need to worry about it 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.930
 I think in advance that this project 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.270
 makes life easier for children and helps them 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.989
 really feel in israel 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.989
 yourself at home 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.130
 we have a big good boy 1st 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.830
 apartment in jerusalem in good area 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
 the funny thing is that once lived in it 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.890
 british general and now we are simple 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.930
 sergeants 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.400
 Israeli army existence such 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.510
 programs that appeared relatively 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.860
 she just makes you just proud 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.260
 for the Russian-speaking aryu 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.020
 the fact that we often know that the American 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.390
 Aliyu support Turkish some more 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.890
 and here finally there were people 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.090
 who see what we do appreciate 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.960
 loner soldiers repatriated to 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.810
 israel alone 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.830
 without family and on their own 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.209
 recruited into elite combat troops 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.790
 country defense armies 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.360
 Despite all the difficulties of these young 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.800
 guys and girls make an invaluable contribution 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.459
 security of israel and all the jews of the world 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.560
 each of us helping them is holy 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.990
 business does not deserve the respect of the army 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 defense of israel and every jew in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.130
 Israel and the Diaspora
