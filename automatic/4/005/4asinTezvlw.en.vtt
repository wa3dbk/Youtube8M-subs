00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.738
Vakifli Village in Hatay
is the only remaining

00:00:10.973 --> 00:00:15.042
Armenian village in Turkey where stone
houses hide behind the evergreen trees,

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:19.738
hour and minute hand of
the clock lag behind

00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:21.786
and people live in peace.

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:29.554
But with its 135 inhabitants
who are all Armenian,

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.659
the village loses its
population day by day.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:44.010
Having realized that the future
of the village was in danger,

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:45.802
the women of Vakifli Village
came together in 2002 to establish

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:50.338
the women branch of the
church in the village.

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:53.138
Their purpose was to sell
their home-made products

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:57.314
to the tourists visiting the church
and make a living out of it.

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:11.939
The men in the village were
inspired by the success of women

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:15.586
and in 2004 Vakifli Village
Cooperative was founded.

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:21.566
The women, who are the sources of
inspiration, started to work as the
Women Branch of the Cooperative.

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:32.010
The Women Branch of the Cooperative,
which was founded by 5 women,

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.562
now has 27 female members.

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:38.275
These women sell their home-made
jam, liquors, pomegranate syrup

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.651
both in the garden of the church

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:45.138
and in a small shop
in Kurtulus, Istanbul.

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:48.890
- We are one step ahead of
the men in this village.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:55.051
Our solidarity is the key that
brought us to this point.
We are under a single roof.

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:07.508
- We produce different kinds of
liquors and concentrated fruit juice.

00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:15.963
We also have home-made pomegranate
syrup, laurel oil and laurel soap.

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:22.068
We have olives and we produce olive oil.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.203
The women in Vakifli Village
produce all of these products

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:35.692
not just to earn a living but
to save the future of their village.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:39.508
They join their forces and
knowledge in order to prevent

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.379
Turkey's only Armenian village from
becoming extinct due to migration.

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:49.528
- We keep our village alive. When we
sell a product here, whether
it is a bottle of liquor or syrup,

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:55.239
we receive 80% of the revenue and
leave the 20% to the cooperative.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.683
This village is our future.
This village is our children.

00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:02.451
In order to protect our children, our
village, we started to work as mothers;

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:08.328
since we are first mothers, then
the members of women branch.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.579
We believe that in every
product we produce,

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.347
we contribute to the future of
our children and our village.

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:23.468
The Women Branch of Vakifli Village
Cooperative reversed the flow
of time in their village.

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.979
They believed in the future of
their children in this village

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:28.395
where no one saw the light of hope.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.907
With the spirit of solidarity,
they made a big difference

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:37.116
both in the future of their
village and their children.
