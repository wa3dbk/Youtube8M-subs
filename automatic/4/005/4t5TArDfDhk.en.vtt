00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:02.699
 almost all these discussions this 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:04.900
 discussion about the style of laws 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.010
 which means with regard to silicone Rostelecom 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.170
 these are substances that create real 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.969
 absolutely cosmetic effect 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.209
 that is, they do not contribute to some 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.849
 there is a treatment course 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.419
 in deep improving it is not easy with 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.449
 9 4 2 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.800
 they are smoother and smoother skin 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.439
 that is, on this basis 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.590
 Silicone receives a letter from such what 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 she was up to that at best 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.270
 but also actions during which entirely 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.620
 clog appliances 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.400
 point 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.030
 This can only be verified by trial. 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 if really since bank zenith 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.110
 Vasily Kobin occupy the field 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.350
 probably of course 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 enjoy free and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.890
 facilities 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.780
 for the purpose of the river contained Neva to the public 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.510
 scored only daily protocol 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.910
 gas of their skin in general, then you can use 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 because really 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 improves skin appearance 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.930
 the only thing that I do not quite agree 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.950
 don't quite understand when still not 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.210
 add a year 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.720
 in funds for night care 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.870
 skin and because when on backs like 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.920
 usually but in general few see it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 city 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.960
 in my opinion this is one time so far on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.720
 freedom from childhood 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 not really justified ie it is more 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 really such 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.360
 Sochi so that if we put 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.680
 felt the skin more smooth to you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.950
 liked 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.500
 but then rinse the skin off with nato 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.360
 how was it therefore I 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.140
 resists using 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 silicone 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 mean their skin care products 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.050
 in year 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.280
 so can I say about these 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.300
 pore 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.690
 p sport and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.560
 in the following each means 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.070
 cosmetic contains active 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 Components 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.580
 and basic components ie basic 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.630
 components are components so 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 which gives reason to believe that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260
 this means 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.980
 And and such components and these precisely those 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 components that work on your 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.610
 skin that give long-term 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.700
 effect which 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.530
 Yuri Chaika who correct which 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.179
 supports certain 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.289
 condition 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.409
 what components and extracts 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.329
 refers to a variety of Moscow 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.229
 donkey design also refers to 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.019
 The active ingredient in vitamins is 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.589
 to the active component 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.809
 there are also various substances for example 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.499
 such as to communicate 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.189
 which also belongs to the active 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.279
 component 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.179
 means if there is money in the composition 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.919
 any means 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.599
 proactive components and think 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.519
 as farther than in sixth place but it 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.099
 highly 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.219
 average 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.489
 fight yes if you drink active ingredients 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.289
 go farther than in sixth place 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.639
 what if you read this vector will 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.809
 purely cosmetic trade cube as noted 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:52.340
 she is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.489
 therapeutic effect it seems no show 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.760
 And professional cosmetics she 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.209
 dropped on which really treats 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.919
 skin that really give 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.259
 tangible effect 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.789
 there are already active components in it 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.819
 in second and third fourth place 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.219
 but everyone is so smart if 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.909
 in my opinion 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.980
 active components by the way further than on 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.679
 sixth place only 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.819
 if it is very weak at best 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.839
 If this happens, just let it moisturize you. 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:24.669
 cube 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.759
 in my opinion and nothing more there 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.869
 what about active ingredients 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.250
 that is, when you look there 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.750
 it is very important to understand for example what is 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.779
 certain active ingredients 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 and so they work under the beatles of children 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.119
 in this list and credit 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.629
 at a certain place if they come 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.479
 cadets end of the list 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.639
 tula 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.649
 certification it will not be very 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.429
 although if the components are like evening 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:57.549
 Moscow some claims which 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.759
 need a little 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.319
 that is, if their positive 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.809
 the answer is likely to cause irritation 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.689
 skin and political action 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.790
 that is why it depends on themselves 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.009
 components ie extracts 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.519
 Moscow 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.409
 burning actives sort of like 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.189
 it is seen 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.159
 it is better that they as often as possible 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.590
 closer to the top of the ingredients list 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.580
 and such components as essential oils 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.260
 and understand cannot go at the end because not 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.820
 wants but strongly render very 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.050
 strong effect on the skin and no 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.520
 scandal if there is too much of yours 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.460
 skin just won't reverse effect 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.979
 that's how further I want to say more 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.789
 about some components there 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.270
 is very popular 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.509
 idea coalition 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.370
 and which are part of one of 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.419
 it's worth noting that this incident is he 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.889
 has moisturizers 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.650
 by actions 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.910
 promotes penetration 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.330
 percent 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.029
 active ingredients will eat 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.949
 but alas 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.879
 there really is a certain UAH he 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.879
 pretty cheap i mean put it 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.770
 most funds 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.090
 but they have one caveat if you 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.330
 find yourself very calmly struck 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.999
 the air in the room 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.669
 that is, if it starts to work with precision 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.649
 but on the contrary, that is, instead of 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:19.940
 moisturizes the skin 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.089
 recall starting with the ears 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.809
 so if you find that for example 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.330
 Find a room with very dry air. 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.200
 like for example you have 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.670
 you eat air conditioning plug 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.820
 it seems really 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.409
 overdried 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.519
 Tula I would not advise you 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.259
 use the means 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.039
 christian when you find with in this 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.789
 indoors because 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.099
 From now on, it will work with accuracy 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.059
 vice versa 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:49.539
 annual percentage 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.349
 UAH so I do not know everything 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.309
 said she wanted 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:57.299
 In general, if you forgot to thank something 

00:05:57.299 --> 00:05:59.599
 following introduced 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.240
 on this subject he is honduras exchange 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.089
 views in comments 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.649
 if the president of the country is effective 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.509
 it was clear the songs
