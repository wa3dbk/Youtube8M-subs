damage they're doing you stay at the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.650 
damage they're doing you stay at the
same<00:02:03.440> damage<00:02:03.710> but<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.610> more<00:02:04.940> defense<00:02:05.480> so

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
same damage but you have more defense so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.080 
same damage but you have more defense so

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
me back basically but if he doesn't have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.420 
me back basically but if he doesn't have
a<00:02:41.810> charge<00:02:42.140> he<00:02:42.530> could<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.800> heroic<00:02:43.040> leap<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
a charge he could just heroic leap and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
get a shock wave even though he missed

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.080 
get a shock wave even though he missed
it<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.460> just<00:02:46.520> takes<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:47.000> little

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
it you know it just takes a little

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.460 
it you know it just takes a little
training<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.600> how<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.900> do<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.260> that's<00:02:48.350> how

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
training this is how I do it that's how

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.790 
training this is how I do it that's how
fast<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.420> charge<00:02:50.530> intervene

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
fast I do it charge intervene

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.400 
fast I do it charge intervene
charge<00:02:52.520> again<00:02:52.820> that's<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.450> that's<00:02:54.080> all<00:02:54.230> there

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
charge again that's it that's all there

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.620 
charge again that's it that's all there
is<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.970> said<00:02:56.030> again<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.480> is

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
is to it and like I said again this is

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.090 
is to it and like I said again this is
the<00:02:56.750> ultimate<00:02:57.020> gap<00:02:57.320> closer<00:02:57.590> because<00:02:57.950> they'll

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
the ultimate gap closer because they'll

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.310 
the ultimate gap closer because they'll
be<00:02:58.130> trying<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.459> intervene<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> scatter<00:02:59.540> trap<00:02:59.840> or

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320

be trying to intervene a scatter trap or
anything<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.800> particularly<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:01.730> that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
anything in particularly like that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.940 
anything in particularly like that
all<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.480> got<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.690> do<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:02.989> charger<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.830> know

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
all you got to do is charger you know

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.250 
all you got to do is charger you know
your<00:03:04.190> target<00:03:04.520> get<00:03:05.300> an<00:03:05.390> intervene<00:03:05.780> off<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
your target get an intervene off and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.160 
your target get an intervene off and
then<00:03:06.380> you'll<00:03:06.560> easily<00:03:07.300> interfere<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.450> all

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
then you'll easily interfere that all

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.570 
then you'll easily interfere that all
right<00:03:09.290> guys<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.650> now<00:03:09.800> we're<00:03:09.920> gonna<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
right guys so now we're gonna get to the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.460 
right guys so now we're gonna get to the
pre<00:03:10.820> shatters<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.450> pre<00:03:11.989> shatter<00:03:12.200> what

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
pre shatters a pre shatter what

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.920 
pre shatters a pre shatter what
basically<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.100> if<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.060> see<00:03:14.239> your<00:03:14.750> so

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
basically is that if you see your so

bursting<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.470> target<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.160> know<00:03:16.280> he's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
bursting of target and you know he's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.250 
bursting of target and you know he's
gonna<00:03:16.520> bubble<00:03:16.820> or<00:03:17.180> Bop<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:17.720> ice<00:03:17.870> walk<00:03:18.110> or

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
gonna bubble or Bop or ice walk or

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020 
gonna bubble or Bop or ice walk or
anything<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:19.430> go<00:03:19.580> ahead<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.880> use

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
anything like that you go ahead and use

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.760 
anything like that you go ahead and use
shadowing<00:03:20.540> throw<00:03:20.690> right<00:03:21.050> before<00:03:21.380> they<00:03:21.470> do<00:03:21.530> it
