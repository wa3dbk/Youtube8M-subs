00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
I had to stop the show and start again I
think<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.299> everything<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> choose<00:01:31.439> in

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
think that everything that you choose in

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.630 
think that everything that you choose in
your<00:01:31.710> life<00:01:31.829> has<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> reflect<00:01:32.520> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
your life has to reflect your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.499 
your life has to reflect your
personality

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
personality

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
personality
I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> X<00:01:34.590> Factor<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> great<00:01:35.220> show<00:01:35.520> for

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I think the X Factor is a great show for

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
I think the X Factor is a great show for
what<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> stands<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
what it stands for I just don't think it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
what it stands for I just don't think it
you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.759> best<00:01:39.090> reflects<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you know best reflects what I do and
