00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.869
 Schorschi play but it's just shot good attack 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.519
 percent 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.659
 around this 1 1 percent 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.989
 it did not rob the good seals 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.529
 the company Bauer praised 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.269
 it also exists in the first round in return Wunderkind the UNESCO 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.759
 2001 immediately in the store build 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.050
 the on the fresh colors and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.830
 and cash in on the dump 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.010
 the 2 1 and FC Barnsley excited on conceding 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.600
 or because in my opinion in the house is percent and percent 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.370
 and if you can see the position of the linesman, he can not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 judge if the ball "as Michi and percent 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.790
 In general, we can do that we can not get it 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.560
 easier that should not be an excuse we also have percent certainly 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.090
 Youngsters themselves too a few percent to smoke too many opportunities 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 allowed the opponent 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.390
 and percent of course you can not be here five minutes before 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.920
 Halftime whistle still 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 we get to look at the 1 1 because half of one's gonna do hand for 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.120
 Green IT is two games already leaving such marks 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.430
 So we had the track already after 20 minutes already exhausting 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.909
 for us 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.770
 So it's already on the body 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 but not very much no excuse for the game equipment 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.810
 and there will be 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.040
 it is clear that everything goes from the body 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 certainly a setback for the federal authorities or in the Bundesliga 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.909
 now percent you have in the Bundesliga natural direct competitors around 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.590
 play the next two and have to be there 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.110
 what is affected 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.380
 unfortunately, has a serum 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.630
 percent 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.280
 probably is percent 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 what her first 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.410
 but who has Varela it's nonsense that's also over risk our goal 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.460
 have lost
