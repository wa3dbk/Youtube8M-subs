Putin's<00:02:55.310> plane<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.720> hopefully<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:58.010> turns

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
Putin's plane so hopefully that turns

Putin's plane so hopefully that turns
out<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:58.879> nonsense

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
out to be nonsense
