00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I needed something that was really going

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.090 
I needed something that was really going
to<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.320> fit<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.450> lift<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.900> up

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
to to fit them back and lift them up

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.950 
to to fit them back and lift them up
because<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.490> don't<00:01:08.640> knowing<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> woman's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
because I don't knowing in the woman's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480 
because I don't knowing in the woman's
experience<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.650> when<00:01:10.799> you've<00:01:10.950> breastfed

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
experience but when you've breastfed

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.929 
experience but when you've breastfed
they<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.299> feel<00:01:12.540> quite<00:01:12.810> sore<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.939> hard

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
they can feel quite sore and hard

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.690 
they can feel quite sore and hard
sometimes<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.869> yet<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.650> dysmorphic<00:01:17.340> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
sometimes and yet and dysmorphic really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
sometimes and yet and dysmorphic really
so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.659> brow<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.290> helps<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> put

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so the brow really helps to put

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
so the brow really helps to put
everything<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.460> into<00:01:20.700> shape<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.990> you

really you just feel so much better in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.849 
really you just feel so much better in
it<00:03:55.430> yeah<00:03:55.909> that<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:56.959> supposed<00:03:57.229> to<00:03:57.290> fit<00:03:57.500> every

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
it yeah that is supposed to fit every

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.219 
it yeah that is supposed to fit every
every<00:03:58.370> shape<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:58.939> we<00:03:59.120> know<00:03:59.299> all<00:03:59.569> we<00:03:59.870> made

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.229 
every shape and as we know all we made

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.920 
every shape and as we know all we made
different<00:04:00.349> shapes<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.129> sizes<00:04:01.930> different

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
different shapes and sizes different

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.520 
different shapes and sizes different
shapes<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.199> sizes

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
shapes and sizes

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.619 
shapes and sizes
I<00:04:03.650> think<00:04:04.129> what's<00:04:04.280> remarkable<00:04:04.519> about<00:04:04.879> this<00:04:05.329> is

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
I think what's remarkable about this is

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.869 
I think what's remarkable about this is
that<00:04:06.139> it's<00:04:06.319> fitted<00:04:06.799> for<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.219> for<00:04:07.519> your<00:04:07.639> body

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.089 
that it's fitted for you for your body
shape<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.959> all<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.259> problems<00:04:09.469> that<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.949> do

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
shape and all the problems that you do

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.830 
shape and all the problems that you do
have<00:04:10.400> over<00:04:10.699> the<00:04:10.909> years<00:04:10.939> trying<00:04:11.419> to<00:04:11.479> get<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
have over the years trying to get in the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.020 
have over the years trying to get in the
right<00:04:11.989> way<00:04:12.259> and<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.620> right<00:04:12.829> clothes<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.609> you

right way and the right clothes that you

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.879 
right way and the right clothes that you
know<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:14.359> it's<00:04:14.629> just<00:04:14.719> alleviated<00:04:15.650> with<00:04:15.709> that

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
know it's it's just alleviated with that

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.789 
know it's it's just alleviated with that
whole<00:04:16.099> new<00:04:16.639> experience

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
whole new experience

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.789 
whole new experience
completely<00:04:18.159> different<00:04:18.810> it's<00:04:19.810> different

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
completely different it's different

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.089 
completely different it's different
codes<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.819> all<00:04:22.120> sorts<00:04:22.659> and<00:04:22.750> she<00:04:23.289> measures<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
codes and all sorts and she measures the

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.129 
codes and all sorts and she measures the
yeah<00:04:24.220> sort<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.030> depth<00:04:25.389> she<00:04:25.780> measures

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
yeah sort of like the depth she measures

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.159 
yeah sort of like the depth she measures
year<00:04:26.440> your<00:04:26.770> ribs<00:04:27.129> I<00:04:27.759> think<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.539> distance<00:04:28.900> here

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
year your ribs I think the distance here

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.460 
year your ribs I think the distance here
from<00:04:29.199> under<00:04:29.770> your<00:04:29.919> eye<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.699> this<00:04:31.539> area<00:04:31.840> sort<00:04:32.349> of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
from under your eye to this area sort of

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
an you nipple area as well and this that

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.080 
an you nipple area as well and this that
that's<00:04:35.590> not<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.889> size<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.520> shape<00:04:36.789> Bay's

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
that's not the size and shape Bay's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.510 
that's not the size and shape Bay's
different<00:04:37.569> than<00:04:37.659> everybody<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.379> so<00:04:38.889> that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
different than everybody and so that

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.129 
different than everybody and so that

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
could all be taken into account when you
