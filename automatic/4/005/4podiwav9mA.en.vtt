00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 [music] 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.170
 on the rear bumper 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.170
 will protect 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.289
 so here it is done 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 mean back side 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.820
 I have already started here 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820
 overstrained 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.320
 approximately in the middle 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.320
 somewhere in the middle 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.939
 the other side 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.219
 it is there like this 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.610
 then the middle 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610
 to press 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.210
 so for now we will not give 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.870
 you escape these 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.870
 pieces of paper 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 I expose approximately 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.460
 in the center of the center here 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.080
 here and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.900
 accordingly here 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.869
 she bent a little 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.610
 meters five can 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.610
 be a little more than 5 5 6 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.500
 so boring enjoy 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.950
 . 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.950
 probably so 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 insert between 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.420
 interest you watch 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.469
 what will I do somewhere 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.999
 5 millimeters from 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.999
 inner edge 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.269
 the same 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.269
 distance to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 bumper 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.430
 now click 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.740
 middle so easy well 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.250
 went to different 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.250
 parties 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.610
 work that is 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.329
 mode and 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.629
 can and water replay 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.629
 this is superfluous 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.109
 now the second side 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.109
 then edge 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.709
 what model 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.370
 stickers probably 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.069
 more suitable for 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.599
 light not for 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.500
 light colored 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.549
 except black can 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.329
 on black and matters 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.129
 given to whom as 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.879
 In short, there is a gray 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.599
 will be practically and 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.599
 types of metallic 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.689
 edge 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.910
 she combined 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.030
 hit directly to the server 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.030
