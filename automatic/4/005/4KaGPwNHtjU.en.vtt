on this is just to help the cardboard
light<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.039> little<00:01:44.219> easier<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:45.090> required

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
light a little easier it's not required

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
light a little easier it's not required
but<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> had<00:01:48.539> on<00:01:48.750> some

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
but it's just something I had on some

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050

old<00:01:49.020> melted<00:01:49.439> candles<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:50.039> it<00:01:50.130> makes<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
old melted candles and it makes it a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.319 
old melted candles and it makes it a
little<00:01:51.149> easier<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.600> start<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:53.270> after<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
little easier to start these after you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
little easier to start these after you

get the cardboard wrapped around in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
get the cardboard wrapped around in
there<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> usually<00:01:56.070> tuck<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> wick<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.880> in

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
there I usually tuck that wick down in

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.639 
there I usually tuck that wick down in
there<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.289> poured<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.840> melted<00:02:00.840> candles

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
different three models I mean the length

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.869 
different three models I mean the length
of<00:03:09.870> time<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.079> they<00:03:10.410> burn<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:11.549> barely

the differences I mean they burn for

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.170 
the differences I mean they burn for
hours<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.650> mean<00:03:17.190> I've<00:03:17.340> had<00:03:17.489> some<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.819> these<00:03:17.910> go

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
hours I mean I've had some of these go

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.599 
hours I mean I've had some of these go
six<00:03:19.170> eight<00:03:19.410> hours<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:19.950> actually<00:03:20.250> had<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> put

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
six eight hours and actually had to put

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.009 
six eight hours and actually had to put
them<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.819> because<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.299> were<00:03:21.359> still<00:03:21.720> burning

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.500 
doctor the right way to do this is a
process<00:04:25.020> called<00:04:25.050> double<00:04:25.710> boiling<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.510> in

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
process called double boiling and in

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.629 
process called double boiling and in
this<00:04:27.630> process<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.169> take<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.530> pan<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.400> water

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
this process you take a pan of water

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.960 
this process you take a pan of water
place<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.449> over<00:04:30.539> your<00:04:30.690> heat<00:04:30.990> source<00:04:31.789> fill<00:04:32.789> that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
place it over your heat source fill that

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.969 
place it over your heat source fill that
pan<00:04:33.240> with<00:04:33.510> water<00:04:33.660> not<00:04:34.080> completely<00:04:34.560> fold<00:04:34.800> about

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
pan with water not completely fold about

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:35.839 
pan with water not completely fold about
half<00:04:35.220> way<00:04:35.430> full

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
half way full

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.540 
half way full
and<00:04:35.940> then<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.510> set<00:04:36.810> another<00:04:37.710> pan<00:04:38.010> inside<00:04:38.430> of

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
and then you set another pan inside of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.279 
and then you set another pan inside of
there<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:38.910> use<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:40.039> pint<00:04:41.039> mason<00:04:42.000> jar<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.390> that's

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
there I use a pint mason jar and that's

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.469 
there I use a pint mason jar and that's
what<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.650> place<00:04:43.860> your<00:04:44.010> wax<00:04:44.219> in<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.669> way<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.240> wax

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
what you place your wax in a way the wax

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.170 
what you place your wax in a way the wax
is<00:04:45.690> not

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
is not

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.450 
is not
directly<00:04:46.570> over<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.930> heat<00:04:47.080> source<00:04:47.289> if<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.250> put

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
directly over the heat source if you put

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.430 
directly over the heat source if you put
this<00:04:48.610> directly<00:04:49.090> over<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.419> heat<00:04:49.570> source<00:04:49.810> yes

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
this directly over the heat source yes

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.159 
this directly over the heat source yes
it<00:04:50.860> will<00:04:51.039> melt<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.729> will<00:04:51.850> melt<00:04:52.060> fast<00:04:52.360> but

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
it will melt and it will melt fast but

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.439 
it will melt and it will melt fast but
if<00:04:53.259> it<00:04:53.380> gets<00:04:53.530> too<00:04:53.680> hot<00:04:54.039> it<00:04:54.400> will<00:04:54.460> explode<00:04:55.120> and

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
if it gets too hot it will explode and

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.080 
if it gets too hot it will explode and
it<00:04:56.050> will<00:04:56.229> splatter<00:04:56.620> everywhere<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.729> you

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
it will splatter everywhere is on you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.300 
it will splatter everywhere is on you
and<00:04:58.389> along<00:04:59.289> with<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.470> splatter<00:04:59.889> will<00:05:00.160> be

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
and along with that splatter will be

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.210 
and along with that splatter will be
flames<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.090> will<00:05:01.330> not<00:05:01.600> be<00:05:01.840> pretty<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.770> remember

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
flames it will not be pretty so remember

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.620 
flames it will not be pretty so remember
if<00:05:03.490> you're<00:05:03.639> gonna<00:05:03.729> make<00:05:03.940> these<00:05:04.150> do<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.539> the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
if you're gonna make these do it the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.529 
if you're gonna make these do it the
right<00:05:04.810> way<00:05:04.870> do<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.680> safe<00:05:05.919> way<00:05:06.389> this<00:05:07.389> has

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
right way do it the safe way this has

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.120 
right way do it the safe way this has
been<00:05:07.660> another<00:05:07.900> episode<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.410> corn-fed
