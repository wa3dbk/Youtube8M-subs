00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
pixel in here is one pixel in him air
one<00:00:24.900> block<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.380> running<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:27.230> he<00:00:28.910> it's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
one block on the running and he it's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.690 
one block on the running and he it's
pretty<00:00:30.269> much<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.929> scale<00:00:31.380> replica<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
pretty much just a scale replica and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
pretty much just a scale replica and
that's<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> only<00:00:33.540> cool<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.579> he

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
looks cool in my opinion but you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.910 
looks cool in my opinion but you can
also<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.329> inside<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> top<00:00:44.809> so

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
also go inside and and up to the top so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.900 
also go inside and and up to the top so
that's<00:00:46.920> pretty<00:00:47.190> cool<00:00:47.280> also<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.550> gravel

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

here's<00:01:01.649> his<00:01:01.949> head<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:05.510> at<00:01:06.530> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
here's his head you can look out at the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
think that's pretty cool and then if I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
think that's pretty cool and then if I
go<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.450> down<00:01:21.900> i'll<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.290> show<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.210> full

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.249 
shot of him that's how I kind of weird
of<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:33.390> might<00:01:33.829> put<00:01:34.829> lava<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.460> eyes

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
of it and I might put lava in his eyes

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.390 
of it and I might put lava in his eyes
like<00:01:37.259> creeper<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.579> saw<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> video<00:01:40.400> but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
like creeper if you saw that video but

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
like creeper if you saw that video but
looks<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.270> his<00:01:42.479> eyes<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> glowing

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
looks like his eyes are kind of glowing

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.090 
looks like his eyes are kind of glowing
right<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.820> because<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> tourism<00:01:45.540> there

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.710 

so<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.460> might<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:50.820> him<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.299> holding<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so and I might make him be holding a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
so and I might make him be holding a
pick<00:01:51.930> axe<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> shovel<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:52.740> something<00:01:53.009> like

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
pick axe or a shovel look something like

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.270 
pick axe or a shovel look something like
that<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.840> he's<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.200> cool<00:01:55.380> what

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that but I think he's pretty cool what

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
that but I think he's pretty cool what
do<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> think<00:01:56.869> leave<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> comment<00:01:58.399> back
