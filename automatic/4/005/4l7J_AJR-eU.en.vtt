00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
me to me when this policy takes he takes

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
awful move I lost track of the fact that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.030 
awful move I lost track of the fact that
now<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.360> pawn<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.570> actually<00:03:33.959> hanging<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.500> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
now this pawn is actually hanging and I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.020 
now this pawn is actually hanging and I
played<00:03:35.220> Bishop<00:03:35.340> YouTuber<00:03:35.790> bearing<00:03:35.970> the

played Bishop YouTuber bearing the
castle<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.080> allowed<00:03:37.230> me<00:03:37.350> coming

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
castle and that just allowed me coming

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.870 
castle and that just allowed me coming
with<00:03:37.680> his<00:03:37.769> night<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.160> take<00:03:38.310> Knight<00:03:38.489> takes<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.820> -

with his night and take Knight takes a -

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.580 
with his night and take Knight takes a -
and<00:03:39.239> now<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.360> materials<00:03:39.840> back<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.110> even<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
and now the materials back to even and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.130 
and now the materials back to even and
I'm<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.760> being<00:03:41.850> frustrated<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:43.019> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
I'm back to being frustrated if you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.050 
I'm back to being frustrated if you
watch<00:03:43.290> my<00:03:43.440> last<00:03:43.470> video<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.250> overconfidence

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
watch my last video on overconfidence

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.150 
watch my last video on overconfidence
both<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.360> those<00:03:45.450> games<00:03:45.600> happened<00:03:46.080> in<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.980> last

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
both of those games happened in the last

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.210 
both of those games happened in the last
hour<00:03:47.730> -<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> blitz<00:03:50.070> match

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
hour - and and this is a blitz match

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.680 
hour - and and this is a blitz match
which<00:03:50.400> I'm<00:03:50.519> awful<00:03:50.940> at<00:03:50.970> blitz<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.480> I'm

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
which I'm awful at blitz and I'm

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.910 
which I'm awful at blitz and I'm
learning<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.170> start<00:03:52.470> seeing<00:03:52.680> little<00:03:52.709> bit

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
learning to start seeing little bit

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.440 
learning to start seeing little bit
better<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.220> blitz<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.670> think<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.150> good<00:03:54.269> for<00:03:54.299> me

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
better in blitz I think it's good for me

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.259 
better in blitz I think it's good for me
to<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:55.500> able<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.650> calculate<00:03:55.830> more<00:03:56.250> quickly<00:03:56.459> but

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
to be able to calculate more quickly but

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.199 
to be able to calculate more quickly but
uh<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.680> now<00:03:58.950> I'm<00:03:59.310> frustrating<00:03:59.760> again<00:03:59.910> because

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
uh so now I'm frustrating again because

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.590 
uh so now I'm frustrating again because
I've<00:04:00.330> I've<00:04:00.840> made<00:04:01.070> big<00:04:02.070> blunders<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.580> two<00:04:03.390> games

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
I've I've made big blunders in two games

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.509 
I've I've made big blunders in two games
in<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.780> row<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.959> I'm<00:04:04.200> getting<00:04:04.530> frustrated<00:04:05.040> and

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
in a row and I'm getting frustrated and

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.190 
in a row and I'm getting frustrated and
again<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.820> think<00:04:06.000> I'm<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.390> think<00:04:06.630> I'm<00:04:06.900> better

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
again I think I'm I think I'm better

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.449 
again I think I'm I think I'm better
Chester<00:04:07.560> than<00:04:07.709> my<00:04:07.769> opponent<00:04:08.130> based<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.340> how

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
Chester than my opponent based on how

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.650 
Chester than my opponent based on how
he's<00:04:08.549> been<00:04:08.610> playing<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.120> should<00:04:09.570> be

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
he's been playing and I should be

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.930 
he's been playing and I should be
winning<00:04:09.780> these<00:04:09.959> games<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.760> some<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:11.850> I'm

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
winning these games and some but I'm

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.300 
winning these games and some but I'm
making<00:04:12.030> mistakes<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.530> my<00:04:13.680> works<00:04:13.920> under<00:04:14.100> attack

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
making mistakes so my works under attack

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.150 
making mistakes so my works under attack
I<00:04:14.549> move<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.480> here<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:16.470> under<00:04:16.709> attack<00:04:16.769> again

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
I move it here we under attack again

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.009 
I move it here we under attack again
maybe<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.760> works<00:04:18.329> under<00:04:18.479> attack<00:04:18.630> again<00:04:18.870> at

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
maybe here works under attack again at

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.030 
maybe here works under attack again at
this<00:04:19.140> point<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> while<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.010> just

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
this point so I think in a while I just

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.390 
this point so I think in a while I just
take<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> draw<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.959> reset<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:23.070> game<00:04:23.190> looks

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
take a draw and reset the game looks

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.370 
take a draw and reset the game looks
rather<00:04:24.180> even<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.780> point<00:04:24.960> anyway<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.260> I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
rather even at this point anyway so I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.270 
rather even at this point anyway so I
thought<00:04:25.470> about<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:25.800> going<00:04:25.919> back<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.099> forth

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
thought about just going back and forth

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.190 
thought about just going back and forth
and<00:04:26.580> uh

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
and uh

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.230 
and uh
see<00:04:27.380> if<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.590> couldn't<00:04:27.830> snag<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.670> draw<00:04:28.940> out<00:04:29.120> of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
see if I couldn't snag a draw out of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.740 
see if I couldn't snag a draw out of
this<00:04:30.700> but<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:31.730> went<00:04:31.880> ahead<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.240> broke<00:04:32.600> it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
this but I went ahead and just broke it

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.260 
this but I went ahead and just broke it
and<00:04:32.840> played<00:04:33.020> over<00:04:33.140> k3

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and played over k3

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.190 
and played over k3
he<00:04:35.270> plays<00:04:35.480> Knight<00:04:36.290> down<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.560> c1<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:38.020> at<00:04:39.020> this

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
he plays Knight down to c1 and at this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.870 
he plays Knight down to c1 and at this
point<00:04:39.410> at<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:39.710> point<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:40.100> Bishop<00:04:40.430> c4<00:04:40.760> would

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
point at this point I Bishop c4 would

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.710 
point at this point I Bishop c4 would
have<00:04:40.970> been<00:04:41.060> great<00:04:42.280> offering<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.340> trade<00:04:43.720> the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
have been great offering a trade the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.880 
have been great offering a trade the
bishop<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:45.140> it's<00:04:45.230> really<00:04:45.320> not<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.500> way<00:04:45.620> for<00:04:45.770> him

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
bishop so it's really not a way for him

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.260 
bishop so it's really not a way for him
to<00:04:45.920> avoid<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> trade<00:04:46.610> without<00:04:46.760> messing<00:04:47.060> up

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
to avoid the trade without messing up

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.180 
to avoid the trade without messing up
and<00:04:47.450> giving<00:04:47.630> himself<00:04:47.780> an<00:04:47.930> isolated<00:04:48.260> pawn<00:04:48.410> so

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
and giving himself an isolated pawn so

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.810 
and giving himself an isolated pawn so
he<00:04:49.280> takes<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.640> take<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:53.590> he<00:04:54.590> probably<00:04:54.890> you<00:04:55.730> know

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
he takes I take and he probably you know

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.930 
he takes I take and he probably you know
kicked<00:04:56.030> me<00:04:56.090> off<00:04:56.240> with<00:04:56.420> a<00:04:56.780> pawn<00:04:57.020> move<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.940> I'd

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
kicked me off with a pawn move and I'd

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.980 
kicked me off with a pawn move and I'd
come<00:04:59.210> back<00:04:59.360> someplace<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.260> 5v5<00:05:01.190> probably<00:05:01.990> and

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
come back someplace a 5v5 probably and

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.300 
come back someplace a 5v5 probably and

down here I'm going to find a way to
snag<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.770> hopefully<00:05:10.010> soon<00:05:11.980> maybe<00:05:12.980> you<00:05:13.160> can

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
snag it hopefully soon maybe you can

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.710 
snag it hopefully soon maybe you can
imagine<00:05:13.430> if<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.790> come<00:05:13.970> in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
imagine if I come in

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.150 
imagine if I come in
with<00:05:15.110> moves<00:05:15.350> like<00:05:16.120> my<00:05:17.120> King<00:05:17.360> here<00:05:18.070> but<00:05:19.070> he

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
with moves like my King here but he

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.100 
with moves like my King here but he
would<00:05:20.090> have<00:05:20.180> he<00:05:20.450> would<00:05:20.510> have<00:05:20.630> good<00:05:20.750> attacking

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
would have he would have good attacking

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.020 
would have he would have good attacking
chances<00:05:21.410> here<00:05:21.670> but<00:05:22.670> White's<00:05:22.820> better

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
chances here but White's better

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.120 
chances here but White's better
definitely<00:05:23.420> better<00:05:23.660> but<00:05:23.990> uh<00:05:24.020> not<00:05:24.470> by<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.680> ton

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
definitely better but uh not by a ton

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.980 
definitely better but uh not by a ton
and<00:05:25.370> this<00:05:25.760> could<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:25.910> a<00:05:25.970> good<00:05:26.090> game<00:05:26.270> but<00:05:26.900> you

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
and this could be a good game but you

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.470 
and this could be a good game but you
know<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.110> make<00:05:27.350> mistakes<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:29.200> he<00:05:30.200> comes<00:05:30.590> in

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
know I make mistakes and he comes in

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.590
