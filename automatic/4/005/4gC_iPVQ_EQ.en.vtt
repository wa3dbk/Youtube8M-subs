00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.340
 survival 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.320
 these are the ingredients but in the end 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.240
 emotions are the main dish served 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.700

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.410
 player from joy the delhi the two 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.150
 protagonists of the game and this is the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.280
 their story set in a future post 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.380
 apocalyptic where humanity has been 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 kneeling by an infection who 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.110
 gets sick becomes a deformed monster 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.120
 bloodthirsty 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.550
 and the few survivors kill themselves in 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.590
 affair to contend for food and ammunition 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.450
 of the basic auction was the tribute of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.290
 naughty dog ​​at the playstation generation 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.790
 3 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.730
 and it is also the title of his debut 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.530
 on the next gen ps 4 this edition 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.050
 remastered does not touch anything in history 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 which has won millions of players 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.680
 we therefore find the single player that already 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.750
 we knew with third-person view 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.820
 where you can advance in the game 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 mainly controlling joel 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.439
 solving puzzles cooperating with the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990
 collecting items to build weapons 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.000
 improvise in a mix of action and theft 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.340
 life then there is the multiplayer part 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.050
 competitive also this unchanged with 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.659
 three methods for a maximum of 8 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.700
 players then the deal came out on 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.070
 ps3 which are not to be bought here at 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 part ie left behind to play e 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.790
 strictly after completing the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.890
 main plot is that tells the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.659
 story of eli and her friend riley e 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.220
 then abandoned territories that instead 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.940
 adds four maps and the part 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.860
 multiplayer 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.780
 what the sector has changed instead 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 technician rightly suited to a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.409
 debut on next gen 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.920
 the native resolution is now full hd 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.470
 1080p while the framerate goes from 30 to 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.390
 60 fps almost stable but is present 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.520
 an option that allows you to delete the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.110
 variations in fluidity by blocking the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.790
 framerate at 30 fps 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.590
 in this case also increases the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.730
 detail of the shadows in our opinion 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.120
 however it is much better to enjoy 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.420
 fluid powder at 60 fps so to speak 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.010
 variables 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.020
 obviously the quality of the 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.880
 textures and images have a clean 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.280
 is an unknown definition and the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.290
 ps3 version the world of the last of us 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.940
 come to life like never before thanks 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.220
 to the power of ps4 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.740
 and always icing on the cake on the disc 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.570
 of play the making of the comments of 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.400
 producers and actors and a level 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.930
 of additional difficulty and hyper 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 Realistic for players looking 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 a real challenge to those who saw quaestor 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.800
 master as a mere operation 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.530
 commercial we want to remember that ps4 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.090
 it is not backwards compatible with ps3 and many 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.950
 users passed to the next gen e 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.570
 playstation from other consoles not 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.730
 they would never have had a chance to play 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.920
 this title is a title that is addressed 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.480
 clearly to them to new users who 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160
 can get their hands on one of the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.080
 best videogame productions in 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 circulation if not the best in 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.860
 absolute while for those who already had it 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.900
 played and finished the simple remains the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.520
 chart does not justify the expense for 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.520
 the purchase of this Roman edition
