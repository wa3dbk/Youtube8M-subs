00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
developer to lift it and the reason why

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.610 
developer to lift it and the reason why
it<00:03:26.310> took<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.850> long<00:03:26.880> 14<00:03:27.870> hours<00:03:28.050> for<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.380> list

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it took so long 14 hours for this list

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770 
it took so long 14 hours for this list
was<00:03:28.830> because<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:29.970> already<00:03:30.330> cold

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
was because you know it's already cold

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.710 
was because you know it's already cold
so<00:03:31.290> there's<00:03:31.769> no<00:03:32.010> there's<00:03:32.250> no<00:03:32.610> heat<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.510> like

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
so there's no there's no heat to like

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.020 
so there's no there's no heat to like
warm<00:03:34.500> up<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.890> hair<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.280> can<00:03:35.489> lift<00:03:35.700> fire

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
warm up the hair so it can lift fire

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.870 
warm up the hair so it can lift fire
that's<00:03:36.209> why<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.420> took<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.989> long<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.470> lift<00:03:38.370> but

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
that's why it took so long to lift but

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
that's why it took so long to lift but
this<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.390> what<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.690> video<00:03:40.019> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.290> be
