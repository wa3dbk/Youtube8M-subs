00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.539
 The site compacts the pack and you will have 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.270

 You will see the emmy fastboot folder . 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.850

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.869
 flash and covers and the file name that I 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.880
 te wrb underline 2.7 point one point one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.080

 it's like entering facebook you have to 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.780
 turn the volume knob to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.080
 down and a button 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.870
 day so safe 25 seconds from there you 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.130
 loose like you did there at the beginning of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.950
 procedure 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.620
 and here you will go down until you recover 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.900
 will select a button up 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.940
 from there you will enter the wrc peste &amp; aida and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.780

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.000
 on here 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.380
 basically full time the first 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.970
 it's the backup 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.160
 so you've always been installing any 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 thing is always important to make a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.110
 backup of all the participations of the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.850
 systems and pulls that bar and from there it does 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.500
 the whole process will save everything in the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.150
 smartphone internal memory 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.400
 here are all the backups 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.100
 What you did is only you select one 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.970
 you can restore a backup you have created 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.730
 before 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.069
 the third step aip then if you are 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.880
 install a new street for example you 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.000
 will mark here should cash all 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.970
 conditions here of the system date is right 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.440
 the internal stores and the card not you 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.569
 brand of these four 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.760
 if you go there to install an update 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.959
 with a for example then you only need 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.450
 df that cash and cash and then you pull 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.579
 aliei will clean up the partitions that the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.810
 selected later you have already done 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.480
 use haiti 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.370
 There you come stoll you go to select the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.440
 Zipped file of the round any suit 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.989
 thing you got down there is always a 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.600
 zipped file you go into the folder 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.860
 Then you put the file you select. 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.340
 that bar will appear there for you 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.019
 pull not only you move and there you go 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.870
 start the installation after that goes 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.340
 start then shut down or restart 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.000
 straight from the system 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.590
 it starts and it will start the error that you 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.209
 installed for example 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.760
 you could see a process well 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.790
 simple is you have a pull and cover on the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.890
