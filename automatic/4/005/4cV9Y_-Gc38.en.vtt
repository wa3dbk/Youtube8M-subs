00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello today we are going to continue with the series 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.400
 of videos of basic techniques so that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.859
 those of you who are starting have a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.829
 little bit clearer let's start with the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.929
 dry brush I will use a marine 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.839
 I've already given him a base layer 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.099
 you can see in the previous video and what 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.899
 only thing that we are going to do right now is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 Give a dry brush to all the armor 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.380
 in this case I give you a base layer of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.600
 blue 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.490
 and now we are going to give him a dry brush 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.490
 with a lighter color 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.380
 we have to do as always shake it 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.380
 a little 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.480
 and this technique what we do is with the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.079
 pretty brush unloaded of paint what 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.989
 we passed gently over the figure and 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.670
 the paint will be on the reliefs and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.250
 I'm going to use a brush that's good 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 It is special for dry brush but you can 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.640
 be any brush that is already 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 a little old as you see, you do not need 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.509
 have a very good tip 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 and very long hair but you can do it 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.060
 with any taken into account that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.409
 it deteriorates a lot so it does not 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.620
 do with the best painters that 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.890
 have 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.120
 well just take a little bit of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.550
 painting 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.880
 we download that all the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.880
 Brush 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.880
 and the idea is to download it so that 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:42.429
 directly do not stain a good test 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.429
 finger paint your finger 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.540
 and that does not leave a normal brushstroke 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.540
 and now therefore carefully 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.110
 as you see with this technique there is no 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.420
 too much precision that's why the first thing 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.280
 What I have done has been to paint the armor 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.260
 if we paint more details and then 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.180
 we want to give the dry brush almost sure 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 we 're going to stain it so it's 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260
 important always good to look at this 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.900
 case what we are going to do the most is the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.180
 drying of blue for the entire armor is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.230
 Do the first thing and we will paint the rest 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.230
 of the miniature 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.940
 it is always better to have downloaded 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.450
 too much the brush and having to pass it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.720
 twice do not download it and leave 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.060
 here to do our job and without hurry 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 if they are the first times do not despair 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.910
 that's good as everything well with a little 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.910
 of practice at the end 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.130
 well here you can see how the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.440
 marine this technique is very useful for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.530
 almost everything from quite surfaces 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.980
 smooth how can this be a tank 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.870
 to areas of hair of animals of desire 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.480
 for almost anything we can 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 use it so good is always 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.650
 very well that I practiced that the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.240
 you have the present because good 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.400
 It is not one of the most popular techniques 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.850
 but they do give good results when 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.040
 it does not work well 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.810
 I hope you have been useful and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.020
 see you in the next video up 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.020
