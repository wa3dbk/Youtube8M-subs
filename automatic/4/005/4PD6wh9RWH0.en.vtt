Archy head and and what that is for and
I<00:01:50.549> also<00:01:50.640> look<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.119> notice<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> lid<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I also look at I notice that the lid is

I also look at I notice that the lid is
melt<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> molded<00:01:53.640> around<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.119> eye<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.869> that

melt is molded around the eye and that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
melt is molded around the eye and that
makes<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.530> jig<00:01:55.829> almost<00:01:56.280> entirely<00:01:56.790> weedless

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
makes that jig almost entirely weedless

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
makes that jig almost entirely weedless
and<00:01:57.680> it's<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.890> difficult<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> get

pull<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.130> these<00:03:09.370> these<00:03:09.730> scattered<00:03:10.360> rocks

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
pull it into these these scattered rocks

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.510 
pull it into these these scattered rocks
that<00:03:10.930> we<00:03:11.050> have<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.320> Clarks<00:03:11.620> Hill<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.010> he'd

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
that we have on Clarks Hill and he'd

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.740 
that we have on Clarks Hill and he'd
just<00:03:12.670> sit<00:03:12.790> there<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:12.970> eat<00:03:13.060> shake<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
just sit there and eat shake it and the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.030 
just sit there and eat shake it and the
fish<00:03:13.900> would<00:03:14.050> come<00:03:14.080> down<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.530> dump<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:14.890> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
fish would come down and dump it and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.510 
fish would come down and dump it and
he'd<00:03:15.760> set<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> hook<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:17.290> when<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.340> falls

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
he'd set the hook it's when it falls

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240 
he'd set the hook it's when it falls
that's<00:03:18.730> got<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> nice<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.330> wobble<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that's got a nice little wobble to it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.980 
that's got a nice little wobble to it
and<00:03:21.270> when<00:03:22.270> you're<00:03:22.390> dragging<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.900> the

and when you're dragging it on the
bottom<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:23.410> wobbles<00:03:24.160> when<00:03:24.340> you're

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
bottom it actually wobbles when you're

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.550 
bottom it actually wobbles when you're
dragging<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.720> good<00:03:25.900> bare<00:03:26.200> bottom

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.110 
jig and it's a good in scattered rocks I
don't<00:03:29.020> like<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.410> use<00:03:29.590> them<00:03:29.770> in<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.730> thick

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
know people use them as finesse jigs and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.590 
know people use them as finesse jigs and
things<00:03:45.550> like<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.120> reason<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.450> like

the<00:03:46.780> ball<00:03:46.960> hitter<00:03:47.140> jig<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:47.980> easier<00:03:48.340> to

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the ball hitter jig is it is easier to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.740 
the ball hitter jig is it is easier to
get<00:03:48.580> get<00:03:48.880> out<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.180> rocks<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.630> gets

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
get get out of the rocks when it gets

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.200 
get get out of the rocks when it gets
hung<00:03:49.900> up<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.800> if<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.040> fish<00:03:51.400> rocks<00:03:51.850> slow

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
hung up but if you fish rocks slow

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.550 
hung up but if you fish rocks slow
you're<00:03:52.450> going<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.660> get<00:03:52.780> hung<00:03:52.960> up<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.320> fish

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
you're going to get hung up so I fish

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.320 
you're going to get hung up so I fish
rocks<00:03:53.830> like<00:03:54.220> riprap<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:54.910> things<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.180> a

rocks like riprap and things like that a

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.060 
rocks like riprap and things like that a
little<00:03:55.660> bit<00:03:55.780> fast<00:03:56.020> I'll<00:03:56.260> keep<00:03:56.530> them<00:03:56.650> bouncing

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
little bit fast I'll keep them bouncing

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.170 
little bit fast I'll keep them bouncing
on<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.190> bottom<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:57.640> I'll<00:03:57.700> keep<00:03:57.880> them<00:03:57.970> moving

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.760 
on the bottom and I'll keep them moving
and<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:58.960> thing<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.200> seems<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.620> come

and this thing just seems to come
through<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.010> rocks<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.370> little<00:04:00.490> bit<00:04:00.640> better

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
through the rocks a little bit better

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.380 
through the rocks a little bit better
for<00:04:01.060> me<00:04:01.260> once<00:04:02.260> again<00:04:02.380> get<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.830> long-long<00:04:03.670> weed

out of the grass pretty easy if

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.719 
out of the grass pretty easy if
it's<00:04:26.729> way<00:04:26.850> through<00:04:27.090> really<00:04:28.080> good<00:04:28.259> jighead

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729

really does does the job in in weeds and
and<00:04:32.340> sometimes<00:04:32.819> in<00:04:32.970> trees<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.270> don't<00:04:33.419> like<00:04:33.539> to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and sometimes in trees I don't like to

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.760 
and sometimes in trees I don't like to
use<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.050> brush<00:04:34.229> because<00:04:34.380> when<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.650> bring

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
use it in brush because when you bring

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.559 
use it in brush because when you bring
it<00:04:34.889> up<00:04:34.949> on<00:04:35.099> brush<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.789> tends<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.210> roll<00:04:36.389> just

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
it up on brush it tends to roll just

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.180 
it up on brush it tends to roll just
like<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.720> spinnerbait<00:04:37.050> wheel<00:04:37.319> and<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.979> sitting

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
like a spinnerbait wheel and you sitting

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.409 
like a spinnerbait wheel and you sitting
