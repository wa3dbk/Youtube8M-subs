they just simply snap into place now
we'll<00:00:25.170> line<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> saddles<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
we'll line these up with the saddles and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.490 
we'll line these up with the saddles and
install<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> hardware<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.930> there<00:00:28.439> are
