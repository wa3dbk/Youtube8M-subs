00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.590
 there were two and two girls and welcome from 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.140
 new a new minecraft video 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.030
 we are in sky wars 6 and we are in a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 special video but before trying the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.719
 main theme of that video I wanted 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.279
 comment on the subject of also the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.740
 sky words maps because the truth is 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.750
 that I have not made a specific video for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.400
 show you all the new maps that have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
 good that I have done clarified have put 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 I think there are three or four in this course 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.179
 normal and have put six or something like that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 I have done more than 10 will have put of my 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.250
 team sky war not the same and I came 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.629
 up very good and night no video 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
 special for it because I do not 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.719
 meeting necessary but still yes that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 I'm bringing little by little I'm playing 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.340
 no minecraft volumes so if I do 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.730
 something like that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 theory should come be the volume 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.790
 perfect perfect then well that's what I'm going 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 bringing little by little the maps of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.180
 skywork is valid for those who follow me 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 and want to see them and have not seen them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 well they can do it but like video 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.600
 or specific because I have not done it because 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 do not find necessary but still like 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.770
 I tell you I 'm bringing you then this 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 video as you will have seen in the title 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.270
 it's about a draw for a premium account 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.550
 the truth is that it is something that had 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.280
 very much desire to do because if 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.840
 we really let go go there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.840
 I am god 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.720
 let's retire someday we throw it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 some day we have it we do not have it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 so basically it's about this 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 it's about a draw that I'm organizing 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.310
 by twitter and good I will leave you in the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 description or on the link of the video 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 what do you have to 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.670
 there is perfect 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.400
 we have an apple we are going to take us 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.470

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.790

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.200
 eye worth 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.480
 I think the interesting things to 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.940

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.520
