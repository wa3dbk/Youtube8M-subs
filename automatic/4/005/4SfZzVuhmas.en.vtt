00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.620
 greetings to all bikers today 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.870
 we are with the kawasaki r 6 in the 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.750
 second generation of a model born 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.550
 in 2006 and well one of the most naked 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.750
 versatile and more versatile 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.250
 current market 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.899
 regardless of the complete redesign of the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 much more attractive body and more 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.640
 modern than the previous version of 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.440
 What's new in this bike is the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.050
 Chassis new perimeter steel chassis 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.810
 it's much more compact more enveloping and 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.120
 next to a tubular steel swingarm 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.980
 otherwise he is still betting on a 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.850
 bicilíndrica mechanics in parallel of 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 650 cubic centimeters and 72 horses 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.090
 almost identical to the previous generation 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.059
 good another of its characteristics is the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.460
 curious rear cushion in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.810
 lateral and inclined disposition that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.700
 it's good to be a little bit more 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.749
 striking that the competition 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.749

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:24.320
 [Music] 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.070
 The truth is that this bike behaves 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.150
 phenomenal has a very good activity 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.610
 a low weight 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.620
 to a large extent the new chassis then I 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.720
 I think it's the constant of that plus 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.460
 the engine helps a lot 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.400
 because good has a calm character 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.370
 but it does not mean that he did not settle 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.020
 when you need it the air 6 n seã 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.630
 Alan to which you best-selling of our 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 country, I think it seems the most 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 logical because it is a motorcycle that gathers 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.300
 series of fundamental characteristics 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 as they are a low price that right now 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.640
 is on sale at six thousand euros 600 more 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 for the version a bs a consumption of laughter 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 in which we have come to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 make averages of 5 liters and for 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.470
 supposed ease a facility 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.470
 driving that very few motorcycles are left 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.090
 well up here in our impressions 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.630
 of the good r6 n I hope that I have 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 liked and see you by web 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:30.900
