00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.460
 I have explained to you several times it is a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.139
 video in which I will be answering 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 to your questions that you sent me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.830
 if they want to send me the next one and not 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.660
 they know how networks send me the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.820
 they send by slate that's where I can 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 normally a picture saying that go to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 be a goat in it and that's where 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.310
 send me my leave in the comments 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 things and I hope you like it 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 let's start with this perfect man 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 send me greetings or that I am perfect him 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.110
 is someone who wants me to respect me 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 that I understand that the truth is that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 that does not exist he and I then in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.390
 reality that you want me to be that although 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 They want me to treat well I think that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 I have but so if we want to talk in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 the physical aspect that I already know is mono 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.350
 It is always physical but it is not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.780
 if he has his tastes and everything to me 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.200
 like to have the change coffee eyes 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.590
 clear 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.330
 neither brown nor be so white nor be 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.290
 so I do not know what cause as right to the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.850
 half or the tallest body and that is 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.220
 a few years older than me because the truth 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 It is not going to walk me as someone 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.620
 I do not believe my age 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.750
 and then I'm an artist it seems like 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.960
 to my perfect type is how to locate one of 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 these priorities insert a photo here 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.690
 so it would be a perfect kind of life and if 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.300
 this is what kind of centers you focus on 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.490
 in the area of ​​weights ok I do not go so much 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.850
 the gym like I used to go and when I lived in 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.890
 Mexico but when I go I go to classes 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.750
 zumba really are singing 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 mexico as such because I felt that it 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.800
 they put the steps too complicated and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 I could not follow them but to give 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.170
 one reason here you make them easy and you're 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.230
 both ones the songs or they are those 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 songs that have Spanish and that is 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.530
 a new meaning then in the makes 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.940
 tastier still nobody knows what 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.100
 means but me when I'm 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.900
 listening is that there is an elite like 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.840
 is putting this kind of thing and then 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.610
 there's also I'm going to pilates and I run the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 truth is that it no longer veneers certainties 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.630
 I moved here but before and I used to do 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.810
 the strangers of mexico that there is not in 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.460
 us and what do you like about us that there is not 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.750
 in Mexico the food came a lot 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.760
 because here you know typical restaurant 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.690
 Mexican and it's full of fat and the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.870
 yellow cheese 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.940
 like this we do not eat in Mexico 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.010
 true but they would never impose a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.700
 Mexican Mexican restaurant would give you 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.900
 very much because Mexican food is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.250
 delicious elche that I have also 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.170
 list of what I'm going to buy 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.040
 When I go to Mexico, I sort of draw 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.910
 food you know tacos al pastor 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.910
 chilaquiles of sanborns 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.140
 Although I do not have Mexico, I believe 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.480
 that more than anything are those of the stores 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.829
 and all and the kind of things you can 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.750
 buy that the team can not 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.939
 buy questions you want to study 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.200
 I want to study administration of 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.200
 companies and then do nothing 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 14 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.480
 Miami because soon it will be the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.569
 meets my mother and she who comes from 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.450
 the beach 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.469
 this favorite brand of makeup 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.799
 lately it has been such because I 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:12.469
 love the idea that everything is natural 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.019
 that has not been tested in 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.030
 animals and all those things and I like 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.889
 my holiday but also you have 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.150
 much liked lately henares of 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.560
 made the lipstick that I have right now is the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.709
 universe and I love a long number 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.900
 I put in but I love this one that you like 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.060
 of the United States and Mexico that in 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.189
 United States I really like that as 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 I support you more than anything in 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.340
 florida I would say because how is it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.719
 I feel that Florida is a very 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.669
 international is this that there are people 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.469
 from a lot of everyone and I feel that 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.439
 thanks to that you can make yourself as a 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.299
 perspective open a store keep 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.239
 the most open mentality because you can 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.669
 lose know different cultures and so 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.090
 I like Mexico I love the beaches of 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.400
 Mexico 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.349
 I feel that Mexico has landscapes 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.909
 beautiful is one of the most 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.730
 beautiful that I have seen in all my life 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.530
 and then also the food as there was 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.930
 said this favorite music do not have in 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.180
 some favorite music with preference 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.220

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.710

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.560

 words and I understand enough but not the 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.650
 He spoke it fluently and that's because in my 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.349
 schools taught me in Mexico I went to 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.780
