much<00:04:27.670> more<00:04:27.850> labor-intensive<00:04:28.180> process<00:04:28.660> is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
much more labor-intensive process is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.160 
much more labor-intensive process is
called<00:04:29.230> rope<00:04:29.530> dyeing<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.100> rope<00:04:30.610> dyeing<00:04:30.940> is

called rope dyeing and rope dyeing is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.900 
called rope dyeing and rope dyeing is
taking<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.290> white<00:04:32.590> yarn<00:04:33.070> dipping<00:04:33.700> into<00:04:33.880> a

Japanese denim so interesting is that
they<00:04:55.630> never<00:04:55.930> allow<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.740> white<00:04:57.130> yarn<00:04:57.520> to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
they never allow the white yarn to

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640 
they never allow the white yarn to
remain<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.540> indigo<00:04:58.870> bath<00:04:59.050> long<00:04:59.380> enough

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
remain in the indigo bath long enough

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.530 
remain in the indigo bath long enough
for<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.160> indigo<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.520> penetrate<00:05:01.030> all<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.270> way

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
for the indigo to penetrate all the way

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.210 
for the indigo to penetrate all the way
to<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.840> core<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.200> yarn<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.010> have<00:05:03.160> a

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
to the core of the yarn so you have a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.340 
to the core of the yarn so you have a
white<00:05:03.490> core<00:05:03.820> yarn<00:05:04.120> with<00:05:04.390> layer<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:04.990> layer<00:05:05.320> and

layer of indigo and what this will do is

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.340
