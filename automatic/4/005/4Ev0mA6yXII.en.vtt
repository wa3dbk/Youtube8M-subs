use Schwartz quasi glitz and it's the

use Schwartz quasi glitz and it's the
total<00:00:47.740> repair<00:00:48.100> shampoo<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:49.150> it's<00:00:49.690> for<00:00:50.020> dry

total repair shampoo and it's for dry

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.760 
total repair shampoo and it's for dry
damaged<00:00:50.890> hair<00:00:51.040> but<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.210> don't<00:00:52.510> have<00:00:52.840> dry<00:00:53.530> or

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
damaged hair but I don't have dry or

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.920 
damaged hair but I don't have dry or
damaged<00:00:54.160> hair<00:00:54.520> but<00:00:55.270> because<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.750> use

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
damaged hair but because I use

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.540 
damaged hair but because I use
straighteners<00:00:56.530> on<00:00:56.680> my<00:00:56.770> hair<00:00:56.950> I<00:00:56.980> think<00:00:57.310> this<00:00:57.430> is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
straighteners on my hair I think this is

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.700 
straighteners on my hair I think this is
a<00:00:57.580> really<00:00:58.090> good<00:00:58.270> thing<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.050> use<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.650> that's

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
a really good thing to use and that's

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.100 
a really good thing to use and that's
probably<00:01:00.040> why<00:01:00.250> my<00:01:00.550> hair's<00:01:00.850> aren't<00:01:01.360> like<00:01:01.750> bitty

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
probably why my hair's aren't like bitty

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.080 
probably why my hair's aren't like bitty
or<00:01:02.620> like<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:04.420> dry<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.860> ends<00:01:06.220> because<00:01:06.850> of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
or like like dry on the ends because of

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.599 
or like like dry on the ends because of
this<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.810> only<00:01:08.530> stumbled<00:01:09.070> across<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.460> by

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
this I only stumbled across it by

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.880 
this I only stumbled across it by
accident<00:01:09.850> if<00:01:10.479> I'm<00:01:10.719> honest<00:01:11.049> with<00:01:11.229> your<00:01:11.409> user<00:01:11.619> to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
accident if I'm honest with your user to

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.080 
accident if I'm honest with your user to
use<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.659> pan<00:01:13.659> ten<00:01:14.079> which<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.219> good<00:01:15.609> but<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
use a pan ten which is good but I

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.099 
use a pan ten which is good but I
actually<00:01:16.299> think<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.749> is<00:01:16.810> better<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:19.109> yeah

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
actually think this is better so yeah

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.080 
actually think this is better so yeah
that's<00:01:20.350> what<00:01:20.499> I've<00:01:20.619> been<00:01:20.799> using<00:01:21.219> so<00:01:21.759> there<00:01:21.909> it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
that's what I've been using so there it

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.999 
that's what I've been using so there it
is<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:24.240> basically<00:01:25.240> what<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.509> do<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:26.109> now<00:01:26.710> maybe

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
is and basically what I do is now maybe

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.499 
is and basically what I do is now maybe
there's<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.369> little<00:01:27.490> bit<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.819> magic<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.329> this

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
there's a little bit of magic in this

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.459 
there's a little bit of magic in this
but<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.869> doubt<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.909> I'll<00:01:31.719> shampoo<00:01:32.259> my<00:01:32.439> hair

and then rinse it out and then I'll put
my<00:01:37.539> conditioner<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.619> comb<00:01:38.859> it<00:01:39.069> through

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
my conditioner on and comb it through

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.139

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
end and so try that because that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.520 
end and so try that because that
a really<00:02:15.299> good<00:02:15.420> tip<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.810> read<00:02:15.989> about<00:02:16.109> that<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.439> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
a really good tip I read about that in a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.459 
a really good tip I read about that in a
magazine<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:17.689> yeah<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:18.719> I'd<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.139> it<00:02:19.170> now

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
magazine actually yeah and I'd do it now

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.170 
magazine actually yeah and I'd do it now
because<00:02:20.010> before<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.370> used<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.579> just<00:02:20.760> condition

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
because before I used to just condition

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.059 
because before I used to just condition
my<00:02:21.299> hair<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.629> then<00:02:21.749> rinse<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
my hair and then rinse it out and that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.940 
my hair and then rinse it out and that
was<00:02:23.219> it<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.909> now<00:02:24.090> I'm<00:02:24.269> like<00:02:24.450> R&amp;C<00:02:25.019> up<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.739> if

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
was it but now I'm like R&amp;C up and if

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.550 
was it but now I'm like R&amp;C up and if
you<00:02:26.159> can<00:02:26.519> bear<00:02:26.849> with<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.569> should<00:02:27.629> try<00:02:28.049> and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you can bear with it you should try and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.789 
you can bear with it you should try and
rinse<00:02:29.400> your<00:02:29.609> hair<00:02:29.909> with<00:02:29.969> like<00:02:30.930> cold<00:02:31.349> water

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
rinse your hair with like cold water

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.429 
rinse your hair with like cold water
because<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.430> seals<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.209> cuticles<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.349> that

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
because that seals the cuticles and that

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.860 
because that seals the cuticles and that
makes<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.889> really<00:02:35.430> healthy<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.480> really

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
makes it really healthy and like really

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.319 
makes it really healthy and like really
glossy<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.889> maybe<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.609> should<00:02:38.790> try<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.060> as

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
glossy so maybe you should try that as

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.539 
glossy so maybe you should try that as
well<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.629> do<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.230> I'm<00:02:40.680> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.430> like

I just comb it out and let it dry

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.319 
I just comb it out and let it dry
naturally<00:03:01.139> or<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.980> towel<00:03:02.250> dry<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.150> it's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
naturally or just towel dry it so it's

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.099 
naturally or just towel dry it so it's
like<00:03:03.419> damp<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:05.579> let<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.209> dry

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109

me if you're rushed for time then

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.839 
me if you're rushed for time then
obviously<00:03:08.969> that<00:03:09.359> doesn't<00:03:09.689> make<00:03:09.810> sense<00:03:10.669> if<00:03:11.669> you

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
obviously that doesn't make sense if you

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.369 
obviously that doesn't make sense if you
can<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.449> night<00:03:12.689> that<00:03:12.959> will<00:03:13.049> be<00:03:13.199> good
