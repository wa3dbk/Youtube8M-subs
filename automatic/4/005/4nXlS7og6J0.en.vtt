00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 random plays was a series of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.370
 videos with one or two bizarre plays 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.820
 strange that happen to me in rne that the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.549
 I will upload every time they happen to me in this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 occasion on my page learn about how 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 finished that play and the answers 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.720
 they were very varied was a game 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.029
 terrible for me but it came out of so much 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.029
 evil that situation let's see 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.850
 the funny thing is that after I use 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.920
 flash the item of the relic that you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.500
 grants a shield and in addition to the school 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.580
 flashlight the term using the flashlight and 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.580
 reglar could kill him 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.170
 let's analyze a little 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.660
 you can see that he has a bar left 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.420
 life and the flashlight gives you almost the bars 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 then the relic gives him two more bars 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.150
 and the inaip damage takes away two bars 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.930
 very possibly he would have died without 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.930
 these shields 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.330
 thanks for watching this video and I want 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.490
 tell them like a player like axel that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.440
 I'm going to make big changes, I'll take 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 decisions that will modify where 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.750
 my path as a player will soon be given 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.390
 account of it and I hope you continue to support me 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.150
 after this since they are not going to do 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 easy predictions greetings and many 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.630
 successes
