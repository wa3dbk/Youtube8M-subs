00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.040
 video tutorial of how to record your pc 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.240
 without lag 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.340
 good this program and many what 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.550
 we know but we do not use it for that 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.390
 well I at least did not know I had that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.310
 function is the one I had kutcher what 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.320
 many of us use it good in most 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.220
 of people we use it to 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.200
 download videos from youtube ok but in 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.180
 one day I started my move him what 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.500
 was I grabbed the locker and I put a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.460
 move him ok then I saw this he believes 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.920
 record and I saw that he had a catcher and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.090
 I said good because it has a catcher but 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.939
 I did not give much importance 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.939
 but I said I'm going to record my minecraft to 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.939
 see how it works in minecraft 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 so 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.310
 achieved mikami minecraft with qantas already 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:46.020
 study but I was super terrible 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.120
 I was going gracefully ok then with this me 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 it was a blow it was like a blow from 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.560
 difference this records you better if ximo 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 renders more, that is, it suits you better 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.259
 fluency so to speak and use it 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.869
 it's super easy, yes, but good 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.730
 select one select the area of 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.850
 good screen here we have two options 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.459
 of the window or be effective and you get 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.770
 all screens the whole screen and 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.720
 then another to draw a line when I 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.549

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.849

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.540
