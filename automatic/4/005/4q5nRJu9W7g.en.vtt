00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.430
 third row and so 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.160
 pay attention that now i will 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.380
 knit not in the loop of the distance between 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.719
 double crochet on previous row 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 for this I do a connecting column 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 to go to the first even better do 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.570
 3 lifting loops but Iâ€™ll say right away that these 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 three lift loops will not count 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.680
 double crochet which we usually 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609
 accustomed to count 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.109
 they will be like you seam and the back will be 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 consist of these 3 lifting loops 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.030
 accordingly, it will be even so 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.309
 I do not consider him so the first distance 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.100
 between two double crochets 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.670
 In case of this there are 3 lifting loops and a column with 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 sc provyazyvayu's here and not in the loop 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.899
 under the jumper distance column with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.640
 double crochet collar with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 nakida further find the next pair here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.859
 where we also knit out one loop 2 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.530
 double crochet here and here we are 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.909
 also is knitted with exactly the same column 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.189
 double crochet collar with 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.650
 nakida further find the next pair and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.750
 we knit a similar way column 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.180
 double crochet collar loop with 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.180
 nakida and repeat in this way 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.170
 repeat to the end of the row at the end of the row 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.780
 connecting stub remind that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 see in no loop but in the distance between 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.299
 two double crochets of the previous one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.299
 row 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.860
 so here is the last distance I knit 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.490
 double crochet air loop 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.940
 double crochet and further case 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.680
 connecting bar with the beginning of the next 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 how can we notice that 2 3 loops 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.770
 lifting they don't participate in the resulting 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.770
 the airport is three kinds
