00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
doesn't go to our way to each edge so

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.380 
doesn't go to our way to each edge so
what<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.969> let<00:00:39.090> me<00:00:39.149> show<00:00:39.329> you

what I'm going to do is let me show you
how<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> take<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> here

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
how to take this and put it on to here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.229 
how to take this and put it on to here
because<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.600> hub<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.399> also<00:00:44.399> different<00:00:44.910> than

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
because this hub is also different than

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.290 
because this hub is also different than
the<00:00:45.750> middle<00:00:46.230> hub<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.030> try<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the middle hub on here and if I try to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770 
the middle hub on here and if I try to
put<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.750> hub<00:00:49.579> onto<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> crankshaft<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.420> here

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
put this hub onto the crankshaft up here

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
put this hub onto the crankshaft up here
-<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:55.280> yeah<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> show<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
- no go so yeah I'm going to show you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.860 
- no go so yeah I'm going to show you
guys<00:00:57.000> how<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.660> that<00:01:01.430> ok<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.329> both<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
guys how to do that ok so I have both of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.660 
guys how to do that ok so I have both of
these<00:01:04.110> clutches<00:01:04.500> taken<00:01:04.979> apart<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> see

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
these clutches taken apart you can see

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
these clutches taken apart you can see
the<00:01:05.790> difference<00:01:06.150> between<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.170> a35<00:01:09.590> clutch

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the difference between the a35 clutch

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.510 
the difference between the a35 clutch
hub<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> ba3<00:01:12.030> clutch<00:01:12.720> hub<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.100> notches

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
hub and ba3 clutch hub here the notches

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.210 
hub and ba3 clutch hub here the notches
are<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.180> different<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.100> what<00:01:17.100> we're

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
are a little bit different so what we're

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
are a little bit different so what we're
going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.500> are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
going to do is where these are these are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
going to do is where these are these are
basically<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.280> square<00:01:20.790> cut<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.420> notches

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
basically just square cut little notches

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
basically just square cut little notches
so<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.740> we're<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.050 
so we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.450> top<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.790> line<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.820> up

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
put this on top of here and line it up

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
put this on top of here and line it up
so<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.350> middle<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> old<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so it's in the middle of the old the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
so it's in the middle of the old the
other<00:01:30.770> holes<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.090> keep<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
other holes here so we can keep it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
other holes here so we can keep it's
much<00:01:33.540> metal<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:33.990> either<00:01:34.829> side<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.610> line

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
much metal on either side as we can line

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
much metal on either side as we can line
those<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.890> cut

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
those up right there and then just cut

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.210 
those up right there and then just cut
those<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> dremel<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.950> an<00:01:40.950> angle

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
those out with a dremel or an angle

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
those out with a dremel or an angle
grinder<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> go<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
grinder if you have one it makes it go a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
grinder if you have one it makes it go a
little<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.049> quicker<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.720> put

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
little bit quicker and then we can put

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.870 
little bit quicker and then we can put
these<00:01:45.899> clutch<00:01:46.680> shoes<00:01:47.640> onto<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:49.140> hub<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
these clutch shoes onto this hub the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
these clutch shoes onto this hub the
reason<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.180> can't<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.509> throw<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.020> here

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
reason we can't just throw this on here

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.609 
reason we can't just throw this on here
like<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.899> because<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
like this is because I don't know if you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.899 
like this is because I don't know if you
can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.670> hard<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
can see it on here it's really hard to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.679 
can see it on here it's really hard to
see<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:58.469> does<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.219> come<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.880> far<00:02:00.509> enough

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
see but this does not come in far enough

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.969 
see but this does not come in far enough
so<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.700> need<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> either<00:02:03.619> cut<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so you need to either cut that in a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.160 
so you need to either cut that in a
little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.570> ahead<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> copy<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
little bit or just go ahead and copy the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.620 
little bit or just go ahead and copy the
same<00:02:09.020> same<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.259> slots<00:02:10.500> into<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:11.009> a35<00:02:11.700> hub

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
same same little slots into your a35 hub

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.360 
same same little slots into your a35 hub
I<00:02:12.660> think<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.560> little<00:02:13.620> bit<00:02:13.740> easier<00:02:13.830> new

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
I think that's a little bit easier new

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.820 
I think that's a little bit easier new
so<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.870> here

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so that's what I'm going to do here

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.880 
so that's what I'm going to do here
today<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.290> next<00:02:19.440> step<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.770> cutting

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
today and so the next step is cutting

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.330 
today and so the next step is cutting
these<00:02:20.130> into<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.330> next<00:02:24.800> okay<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.040> have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
these into and do that next okay I have

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.120 
these into and do that next okay I have
both<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.910> clutches<00:02:27.150> actually<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
both of the clutches actually in this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.860 
both of the clutches actually in this
place<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.760> lined<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.330> next<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> each<00:02:30.750> other

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
place here lined up next to each other

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.600 
place here lined up next to each other
and<00:02:31.230> nut<00:02:31.920> notch<00:02:32.310> from<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:34.850> a3<00:02:35.850> clutch<00:02:36.470> shoe<00:02:37.610> or

and<00:02:45.720> we're<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> take<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.530> angle

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
and we're going to take this angle

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.570 
and we're going to take this angle
grinder<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.750> ahead<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.580> cut

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
grinder here and just go ahead and cut

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.880 
grinder here and just go ahead and cut
that<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.000> match<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.420> a3<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.770> just

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that out to match the a3 so you can just

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
that out to match the a3 so you can just
slop<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.340> other<00:02:53.460> shoes<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> 8:35<00:02:54.690> hub

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
slop the other shoes on to the 8:35 hub

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.130 
slop the other shoes on to the 8:35 hub

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
it's that simple so I'm going to cut

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.690 
it's that simple so I'm going to cut
these<00:02:58.290> slip<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.770> around<00:02:58.800> an<00:02:59.220> excellent<00:02:59.580> whip

your a 3 clutch shoes onto the sub now

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.520 
your a 3 clutch shoes onto the sub now
there<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.060> one<00:03:21.270> weird<00:03:21.840> thing<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.380> have

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530

to<00:03:22.680> take<00:03:23.190> note<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.460> on<00:03:24.170> these<00:03:25.170> shoes<00:03:25.770> if<00:03:26.130> you

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
to take note of on these shoes if you

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310 
to take note of on these shoes if you
look<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.970> difference<00:03:27.120> between<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.750> a3<00:03:28.200> and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
look the difference between the a3 and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.020 
look the difference between the a3 and
the<00:03:28.380> 8:35<00:03:28.920> shoes<00:03:29.190> are<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.550> pin<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
the 8:35 shoes are the pin is in the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.110 
the 8:35 shoes are the pin is in the
opposite<00:03:30.570> side<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.650> when<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.610> clutch<00:03:32.940> is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
opposite side so when the clutch is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.470 
opposite side so when the clutch is
spinning<00:03:33.630> if<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.850> turn<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.090> normal<00:03:36.420> way

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
spinning if you turn it the normal way

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.010 
spinning if you turn it the normal way
it<00:03:36.690> would<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.970> actually<00:03:39.540> would<00:03:39.990> be

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
it would be it actually would be

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.220 
it would be it actually would be
spinning<00:03:40.740> this<00:03:41.160> way<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.820> that's<00:03:42.270> not<00:03:42.600> our

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
spinning this way and that's not our

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
spinning this way and that's not our
weight<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.590> would<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.770> spinning<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.310> way<00:03:44.580> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
weight it would be spinning this way and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.190 
weight it would be spinning this way and
that's<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> way<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.660> want<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.020> be

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
that's not the way you want it to be

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.480 
that's not the way you want it to be
spinning<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.590> what<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.800> do<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.070> flip<00:03:47.250> this

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
spinning so what you do is you flip this

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.080 
spinning so what you do is you flip this
over<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:49.130> install<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.430> way<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:50.730> while

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
over and install it this way so while

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.290 
over and install it this way so while
the<00:03:51.720> clutch<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.110> spinning<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.709> way

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
the clutch is spinning this way

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.900 
the clutch is spinning this way
clockwise<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.950> actually<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.459> pulling<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
clockwise and actually be pulling it

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.610 
clockwise and actually be pulling it
from<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> front<00:03:57.450> instead<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.990> pushing<00:03:58.410> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
from the front instead of pushing it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.670 
from the front instead of pushing it
from<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.970> back<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.260> that's<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.470> little<00:04:01.560> bit

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
from the back so that's a little bit

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.970 
from the back so that's a little bit
weird<00:04:01.830> but<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.160> will<00:04:02.220> run<00:04:02.459> fine<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.850> way<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
weird but it will run fine that way and

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.600 
weird but it will run fine that way and
yeah<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.040> should<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.459> able<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:07.610> 3

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
yeah you should be able to have a 3

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.040 
yeah you should be able to have a 3
clutch<00:04:08.820> shoes<00:04:09.060> would<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.450> lot<00:04:09.780> more

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
clutch shoes would have a lot more

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.990 
clutch shoes would have a lot more
material<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.920> lot<00:04:11.040> better<00:04:11.250> material<00:04:11.820> that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
material and a lot better material that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.420 
material and a lot better material that
won't<00:04:12.150> wear<00:04:12.720> down<00:04:12.870> as<00:04:13.050> easily<00:04:13.310> under<00:04:14.310> your<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
won't wear down as easily under your a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.900 
won't wear down as easily under your a
35<00:04:15.200> clutch<00:04:16.200> hub<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.770> one<00:04:17.370> other<00:04:17.520> thing<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.790> I

35 clutch hub and one other thing that I
did<00:04:18.120> run<00:04:18.239> into<00:04:18.299> was<00:04:18.780> when<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.799> cut<00:04:20.070> these<00:04:20.190> they

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
did run into was when I cut these they

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.460 
did run into was when I cut these they
were<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.520> little<00:04:20.700> bit<00:04:20.970> too<00:04:21.180> thin<00:04:21.630> side<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.229> side

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
were a little bit too thin side to side

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.840 
were a little bit too thin side to side
so<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.950> grinded<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.430> out

you do put this on to crankshaft you can

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.760 
you do put this on to crankshaft you can
see<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.720> strings<00:05:31.020> are<00:05:31.260> facing<00:05:31.650> outward
