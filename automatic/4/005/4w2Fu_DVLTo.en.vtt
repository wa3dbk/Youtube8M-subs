been building it with my nephew a
teenager<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.470> he's<00:00:22.650> gonna<00:00:22.949> make<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
teenager so he's gonna make a lot of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.040 
teenager so he's gonna make a lot of
crazy<00:00:25.050> sound<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:27.210> using<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> graphic

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
crazy sound and we using the graphic

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
crazy sound and we using the graphic
card<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:29.099> 9<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.240> 17<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:32.180> we're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
card really on out 9 to 17 and we're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
card really on out 9 to 17 and we're
using<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.690> core<00:00:33.930> CSC<00:00:34.620> X<00:00:35.090> 600<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.770> also

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
using the core CSC X 600 and also

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.190 
using the core CSC X 600 and also
putting<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:41.610> SSD<00:00:43.070> kingston<00:00:44.840> 240<00:00:45.840> cake<00:00:48.200> and

putting an SSD kingston 240 cake and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.020 
putting an SSD kingston 240 cake and
then<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.649> using<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.010> hyper<00:00:50.250> x<00:00:50.780> ddr3<00:00:54.469> 1600

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
then we're using a hyper x ddr3 1600

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.099 
then we're using a hyper x ddr3 1600
that's<00:00:57.030> 69<00:00:58.969> okay<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.300> already<00:01:00.600> put<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that's 69 okay and we already put in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.990 
that's 69 okay and we already put in the
cpu<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.680> memory<00:01:05.309> already<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
cpu and the and the memory already and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.340 
cpu and the and the memory already and
also<00:01:06.299> connect<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> bottle<00:01:07.110> case<00:01:07.860> wire<00:01:09.350> into

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
also connect the bottle case wire into

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
also connect the bottle case wire into
the<00:01:10.470> hard<00:01:10.619> drive<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:11.580> gonna<00:01:11.700> be

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the hard drive and then we're gonna be

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
the hard drive and then we're gonna be
putting<00:01:12.210> into<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> power<00:01:12.780> supply<00:01:12.900> mix<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
putting into the power supply mix the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.499 
putting into the power supply mix the

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
memory we using is the hyper x ddr3 1600
that's<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> numbers<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.280> an

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that's the numbers and we put in an

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960 
that's the numbers and we put in an
already<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:28.290> also<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> the

cards next onto the slot and you will
see<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.010> later<00:02:30.220> when<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.000> put<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.510> CPU

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
see that later when you put in the CPU

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.229 
see that later when you put in the CPU
making<00:02:32.230> sure<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> stock<00:02:36.070> am<00:02:36.790> the

fan CPU fan let's make sure that you
know<00:02:40.690> when<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.620> put<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.010> already<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
know when you put it is already have a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.750 
know when you put it is already have a
thermal<00:02:43.450> place<00:02:43.630> on<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.989> make<00:02:44.650> sure<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:45.040> you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
thermal place on it make sure that you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.930 
thermal place on it make sure that you
know<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.750> why<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:48.040> CPU<00:02:48.459> fan<00:02:48.670> why

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
know this the why is the CPU fan why

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.979 
know this the why is the CPU fan why
it's<00:02:49.180> close<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> motherboard<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.989> and

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
it's close to the motherboard and and

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's close to the motherboard and and
then<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.620> basically<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.100> put<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.700> both

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
then you basically just put it in both

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.790 
then you basically just put it in both
sides<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> same<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.450> believe<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.110> can<00:02:59.319> put

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
sides the same you I believe you can put

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.220 
sides the same you I believe you can put
it<00:02:59.890> either<00:03:00.100> way<00:03:00.459> we<00:03:01.390> decided<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> put<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.080> here

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it either way we decided to put it here

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.650 
it either way we decided to put it here
because<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> little<00:03:03.280> bit<00:03:03.370> closer<00:03:03.660> for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
because this is a little bit closer for

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.960 
because this is a little bit closer for
the<00:03:04.720> wire<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:07.060> also<00:03:07.239> put<00:03:07.570> in<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.549> optical

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the wire we also put in the the optical

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.870 
the wire we also put in the the optical
drive<00:03:10.090> already<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.070> already<00:03:12.400> connected

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
drive already and it's already connected

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.460 
drive already and it's already connected
the<00:03:13.630> cable<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.489> installation<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
the cable the the installation of the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.850 
the cable the the installation of the
CPU<00:03:17.579> having<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.730> DVD<00:03:19.630> drive<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.079> quite<00:03:20.410> easy

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
CPU having the DVD drive is quite easy

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.539 
CPU having the DVD drive is quite easy
after<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.340> pop<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.820> front<00:03:22.239> panel<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:23.549> we

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
after we pop the front panel here we

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.710 
after we pop the front panel here we
just<00:03:24.730> have<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.209> hand<00:03:26.140> screw<00:03:26.470> these<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.540> which

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
just have to hand screw these this which

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.630 
just have to hand screw these this which
come<00:03:28.959> off<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:31.090> holes<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.640> screws

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
come off and the holes for the screws

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.500 
come off and the holes for the screws
match<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.840> holes<00:03:35.110> here<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.269> why<00:03:37.269> we<00:03:37.420> don't

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
match the holes here so why we don't

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
match the holes here so why we don't
have<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.780> screw<00:03:37.989> anything<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.530> or<00:03:38.799> we<00:03:38.980> have<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
have to screw anything in or we have the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.500 
have to screw anything in or we have the
Jesus<00:03:39.370> put<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.910> do<00:03:43.030> have<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.359> make

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
Jesus put this on we do have to make

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.319 
Jesus put this on we do have to make
sure<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.900> host<00:03:44.140> goes<00:03:44.380> in<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.859> then<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.940> turn

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
sure the host goes in and then you turn

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.030 
sure the host goes in and then you turn
and<00:03:46.359> then<00:03:46.720> that's<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.890> already

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and then that's it and it's already

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.560 
and then that's it and it's already
mounted<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.730> know<00:03:48.820> there's<00:03:49.000> no<00:03:49.120> school<00:03:49.450> to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
you won't break the clip off but it will

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.340 
you won't break the clip off but it will
be<00:04:43.210> very<00:04:43.450> secure<00:04:43.930> once<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.890> put<00:04:45.100> it<00:04:45.220> in<00:04:46.350> okay
