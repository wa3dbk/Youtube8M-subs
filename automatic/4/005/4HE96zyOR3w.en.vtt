00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
developing nation just like us they

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420

managed<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.320> move<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> manufacturing<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
managed to move up the manufacturing and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100

other Southeast Asian countries so how

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.980 
other Southeast Asian countries so how
do<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.290> move<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> value<00:01:37.890> chain<00:01:38.180> well<00:01:39.180> hence

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
do we move up the value chain well hence

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.649 
do we move up the value chain well hence

now been two years into the program and

what is it achieved so far to be sure
they<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.450> definitely<00:02:03.869> been<00:02:04.079> hits<00:02:04.380> and

they have definitely been hits and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
they have definitely been hits and
misses<00:02:04.880> perhaps<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.210> unlike<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
