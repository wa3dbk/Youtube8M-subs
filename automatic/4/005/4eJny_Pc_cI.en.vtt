we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.299> talk<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:06.690> two<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
we're going to talk about two of the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.610 
we're going to talk about two of the
most<00:00:07.890> important<00:00:08.730> parts<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.750> sorting<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.440> me

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
most important parts of sorting to me

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.280 
most important parts of sorting to me
and<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.420> horse<00:00:12.690> moves<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.139> its

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and that is how this horse moves on its

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.400 
and that is how this horse moves on its
front<00:00:13.500> end<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.980> how<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.309> stops<00:00:14.990> because<00:00:15.990> when

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
front end and how it stops because when

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.250 
front end and how it stops because when
you<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.910> sorting<00:00:17.910> you're<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> go<00:00:19.050> into

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
you are sorting you're going to go into

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
you are sorting you're going to go into
that<00:00:19.380> pin<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.310> you're<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> cut<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that pin and you're going to cut off a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.800 
that pin and you're going to cut off a
cow<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.039> cow<00:00:23.369> might<00:00:23.670> stop<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.660> turn

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
cow and that cow might stop and turn

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.240 
cow and that cow might stop and turn

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
that we can illustrate a little bit more

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.740 
that we can illustrate a little bit more
I<00:02:35.740> don't<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> cow<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.670> here<00:02:36.850> today<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.120> I'm

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
going to show you what it's going to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.840 
going to show you what it's going to
look<00:02:40.330> like<00:02:40.720> if<00:02:41.290> we're<00:02:41.740> going<00:02:41.980> into<00:02:42.250> sorting<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
look like if we're going into sorting a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.650 
look like if we're going into sorting a
cow<00:02:43.060> okay<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.370> don't<00:02:45.580> practice<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.360> cows

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
cow okay and I don't practice with cows

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.990 
cow okay and I don't practice with cows
a<00:02:47.560> whole<00:02:48.220> lot<00:02:48.460> because<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.330> want<00:02:50.020> my<00:02:50.170> horses

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
a whole lot because I want my horses

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600 
a whole lot because I want my horses
learning<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.330> listen<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:53.080> me<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.650> not<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
learning to listen to me and not to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.720 
learning to listen to me and not to
track<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.060> cow<00:02:55.950> especially<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.280> sorting

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
track the cow especially in the sorting

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.930 
track the cow especially in the sorting
you<00:02:58.120> say<00:02:58.330> well<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.510> sounds<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.080> little<00:02:59.200> funny

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
you say well that sounds a little funny

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.700 
you say well that sounds a little funny
well<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.180> reason<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.170> if

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
well the reason for that is because if

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.590 
well the reason for that is because if
you<00:03:02.860> train<00:03:03.160> them<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:04.420> hook<00:03:04.990> onto<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.410> cow<00:03:06.600> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
you train them to to hook onto a cow and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240 
you train them to to hook onto a cow and
they<00:03:08.020> hook<00:03:08.200> onto<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.590> wrong<00:03:08.770> one<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
they hook onto the wrong one in the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.760 
they hook onto the wrong one in the
sorting<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:09.970> cause<00:03:10.180> problems<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.380> want

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
sorting it can cause problems so I want

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.970 
sorting it can cause problems so I want
these<00:03:11.980> horses<00:03:12.420> connected<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.720> me<00:03:14.050> not<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
these horses connected to me not to the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.710 
these horses connected to me not to the
cows<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.030> why<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.240> don't<00:03:16.420> do<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.630> whole

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
cows so that's why I don't do a whole

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.030 
cows so that's why I don't do a whole
lot<00:03:16.930> practice<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:18.100> cows<00:03:19.620> okay<00:03:20.620> it's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
lot practice with cows okay it's

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
lot practice with cows okay it's
different<00:03:21.400> than<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> cutting<00:03:22.090> when<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.330> hook

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
different than the cutting when you hook

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.480 
different than the cutting when you hook
onto<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.050> horse<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.470> cutting<00:03:23.800> or<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.010> cow<00:03:24.220> and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
onto a horse and cutting or a cow and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.460 
onto a horse and cutting or a cow and
cutting<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:25.330> want<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.690> horse<00:03:25.930> there<00:03:26.230> with

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
cutting you want that horse there with

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.540 
cutting you want that horse there with
that<00:03:26.680> cow<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.670> not<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.240> much<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.810> sorting

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
that cow it's not so much in the sorting

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.120 
that cow it's not so much in the sorting
okay<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.180> our<00:03:31.209> energy<00:03:32.050> up<00:03:32.680> we're<00:03:33.010> going

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
okay so we got our energy up we're going

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.670 
okay so we got our energy up we're going
to<00:03:33.190> go<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.640> I'm<00:03:34.480> going<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.750> stop<00:03:35.050> my<00:03:35.200> horse<00:03:35.410> hope
