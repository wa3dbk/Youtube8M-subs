00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.280
 terribly scary so it is 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.280
 dead ang 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.059
 in this series we will take you through the 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.130
 development and creation of the latest 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.980
 spectacular roller coaster from the efteling 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.500
 in this episode we travel with it 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.119
 project team on a working visit to germany 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.160
 In addition, we look at how it works 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.080
 state on the construction site has the bad 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.630
 weather of the past period 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.970
 delayed and how does it experience 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.500
 project team their first ride in a dive 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.230
 coaster 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 this is the opinion or baron 1898 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.120
 around Christmas and new years eve 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.420
 construction site of baron 1898 affected by 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.460
 snowfall and a lot of cold on the construction site 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.680
 is now being worked hard again 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.600
 but everything is still on schedule we would 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.430
 recognized throughout the church throughout the summer 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.739
 Christmas holidays and there must be done and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.649
 we have had setbacks t quite 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.570
 snows for a few days 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.130
 good if located but again 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.080
 wounds between longer caught up and solo 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.420
 pro reasonably on schedule 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.500
 we are now at the bottom of the tunnel of the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.170
 our your attraction 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.630
 the film is as far as the homebrew line 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.520
 We can still stand now 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.380
 with bricklaying because building we have 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.970
 another 2 weeks needed to complete the building 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 complete from the bricklaying 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 are busy with the roofs we have one 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.890
 roof completely closed so that is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.450
 be watertight in between even though 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.369
 started within immediately teeth 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 be themed with in shadows from 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 installing walls and ceiling 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.670
 we are already some theme elements 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.110
 my start fire we go early February 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.090
 really see a roller coaster there come the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 Share roller coaster inside and then we start 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.940
 here with building the tower 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 and that is a very important point 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.440
 to our left is the type of roller coaster 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.600
 coming is a dive coaster and the unique 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.220
 that is also your one 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.840
 where she could really depends still hangs 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.939
 really look above the abyss 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.140
 And that also makes it very exciting 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.920
 the roller coaster builder that we chose 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 to have 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.720
 this legs why legs is w &amp; m 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.220
 specialized in making the tyro 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.549
 There are already more than nine roller coasters 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.259
 built 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.180
 hence they are excellent 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.289
 offer quality where you are optimal 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.670
 can use 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.440
 this aqua becomes unique because we 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.330
 natural story from start to finish 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.459
 you'll get that from the queue 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 until the last moment that you turn 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.270
 a station comes back 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 The proudest thing I am at is that this one 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.310
 roller coaster is unique and it's not one 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.480
 standard manufacture 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.130
 very important for us to look too 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.750
 to other trucks that we certainly park 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.459
 we know the right supplier and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.300
 the right arms that's why we went to hyde 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.680
 been park 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.940
 we learned a lot about them technically 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.940
 flat but also at operational level 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.040
 to get acquainted with a 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 dive coaster is the project team on 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.420
 working visit in germany 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.290
 this is cracking this is a dive coaster 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.290
 from beernem 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.870
 No 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.640
 build the roller coasters that build the track 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.800
 but we have to put together 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.810
 we must complete package 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.580
 further assemble so then have to own the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.989
 make a distribution 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.790
 it would come to me that we must 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.260
 to be mounted and then it has to be 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.730
 be connected electrically 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.099
 we all do that with local people 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.989
 companies and it is a whole for them 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:18.480
 good to see what happened 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.239
 job together is that i like it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.680
 building finished and then a whole 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.540
 great tension member be built 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.010
 there they looked how can this how 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.230
 we can still mount the motor if it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.700
 can build place is there is especially 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.620
 looked at 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.049
 this technically incredibly well built 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.530
 he drives very smoothly kept silent 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.910
 if you if you have to go buy you belong there 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.569
 nothing of yo just take anything 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.580
 the people want 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.890
 for a technically very very whole 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.670
 the job is well put together and of course 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.330
 the drop is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.330
 is unique 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.680
 all of them 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.300
 while the project is on its way back 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.490
 is to the netherlands being in budapest 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.810
 worked hard on the construction of the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.609
 lift ears 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.829
 as soon as it is ready it will finish 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.660
 transport to the efteling 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.970
 and then it won't be long before 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.690
 the first roller coaster steel in Kaatsheuvel 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.690
 will rise 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.410
 subscribe and keep looking for more 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.410
