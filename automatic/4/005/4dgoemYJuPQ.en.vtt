this scene voted well for I presumed
that<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.390> collapse<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.140> retreat<00:03:16.590> must

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.039 
that the collapse of the retreat must
have<00:03:17.340> followed<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.030> ancient<00:03:18.540> vampires

demise<00:03:20.030> there<00:03:21.030> was<00:03:21.120> only<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.660> obstacle<00:03:22.459> how

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
demise there was only one obstacle how

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.940 
demise there was only one obstacle how
to<00:03:23.910> reach<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.450> balcony<00:03:25.019> suspended<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.799> that

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
maddening height so far beyond my reach

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.090 
maddening height so far beyond my reach
for<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.360> was<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.750> architecture<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> winget

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.259 
creatures the tattered ruins of my wings
were<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.970> no<00:03:36.180> use<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:37.459> would<00:03:38.459> need<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.880> devise
