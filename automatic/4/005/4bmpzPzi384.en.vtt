Lincolnshire travelled all the way

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.129 
Lincolnshire travelled all the way
across<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> country<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.639> see<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.120> tree<00:00:09.599> but

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
across the country to see one tree but

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.890 
across the country to see one tree but
what<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> tree<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.519> possibly<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> most

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
what a tree this is possibly the most

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.900 
what a tree this is possibly the most
important<00:00:13.500> tree<00:00:13.740> scientifically<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
important tree scientifically in the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300 
important tree scientifically in the
whole<00:00:15.089> world<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:16.289> been<00:00:16.500> waiting<00:00:16.830> years<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
whole world I've been waiting years to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.010 
whole world I've been waiting years to
see<00:00:17.670> it

see it
yes<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.410> Sir<00:00:19.980> Isaac<00:00:20.400> Newton's<00:00:20.850> apple<00:00:21.060> tree

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
yes it's Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109 
yes it's Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree
and<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.050> still<00:00:22.289> alive<00:00:22.590> after<00:00:22.859> 350<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:23.970> more

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and it's still alive after 350 or more

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.960 
and it's still alive after 350 or more
years<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.680> actually<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> good<00:00:26.730> man

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
looking for this big salubrious building

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
looking for this big salubrious building
it<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.430> doesn't<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> yes<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.600> amazing<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it just doesn't it yes it's amazing and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
it just doesn't it yes it's amazing and
this<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:48.180> orchard<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this looks very much like an orchard it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
this looks very much like an orchard it
is<00:00:49.170> indeed<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> slight

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
is indeed it is but it's got a slight

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.040 
is indeed it is but it's got a slight
difference<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:51.719> only<00:00:51.870> one

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
difference in that there's only one

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
difference in that there's only one
variety<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> tree<00:00:52.800> growing<00:00:53.070> within<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
variety of tree growing within it and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
variety of tree growing within it and
all<00:00:54.030> cuttings<00:00:54.480> from<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.840> particularly

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
all cuttings from one particularly

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
all cuttings from one particularly
famous<00:00:55.829> specimen<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.059> happen<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
famous specimen that happen to be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
famous specimen that happen to be
anything<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> flower<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> Kent<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
anything like a flower of Kent it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.950 
anything like a flower of Kent it
certainly<00:01:00.180> weren't<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
certainly weren't it's the one that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
certainly weren't it's the one that
inspired<00:01:01.320> his<00:01:01.469> theories<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.920> gravity<00:01:02.309> Wow

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
inspired his theories on gravity Wow

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.130 
inspired his theories on gravity Wow
the<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> allegedly<00:01:03.600> dropped<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> Apple

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the one that allegedly dropped the Apple

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
the one that allegedly dropped the Apple
yeah<00:01:04.530> every<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.909> cuttings

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
yeah every one of these are cuttings

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.690 
yeah every one of these are cuttings
from<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.320> tree<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
from that one tree they are well the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
from that one tree they are well the
original<00:01:09.090> trees<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.540> sort<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> over<00:01:10.170> 350

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
original trees now sort of over 350

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.260 
original trees now sort of over 350
years<00:01:11.159> old<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> best<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
years old and with the best will in the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
years old and with the best will in the
world<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.630> only<00:01:12.689> gonna<00:01:12.930> live<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.409> long<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
world it's only gonna live so long so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
world it's only gonna live so long so
we've<00:01:14.430> taken<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.150> steps<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.420> grow<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we've taken the steps to grow but I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
we've taken the steps to grow but I
think<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.350> half<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.740> dozen<00:01:16.830> extra

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
think that's about half a dozen extra

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
think that's about half a dozen extra
trees<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.210> original<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
trees from that original just to try and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
trees from that original just to try and
protect<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> future<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
protect it for the future that is the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
protect it for the future that is the
oldest<00:01:21.240> apple<00:01:21.720> tree<00:01:21.840> I've<00:01:21.960> heard<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.320> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
oldest apple tree I've heard of really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.910 
oldest apple tree I've heard of really
it's<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.189> stunningly<00:01:23.939> older<00:01:24.420> 100<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.590> 20

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it's just stunningly older 100 and in 20

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's just stunningly older 100 and in 20
year<00:01:26.040> old<00:01:26.220> apple<00:01:26.759> tree<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> very<00:01:27.390> old<00:01:27.570> apple

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
year old apple tree is a very old apple

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
year old apple tree is a very old apple
tree<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.799> aren't<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> long-lived

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tree right they aren't a long-lived

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
tree right they aren't a long-lived
species<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.409> about

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
species at all well I think it was about

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
species at all well I think it was about
a<00:01:31.619> hundred<00:01:31.829> when<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> fell<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.579> yeah<00:01:33.000> because

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a hundred when it fell over yeah because

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
a hundred when it fell over yeah because
it's<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.840> falling<00:01:34.170> over<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.590> re

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's actually falling over and then re

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's actually falling over and then re
grown<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> original<00:01:35.790> truck<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
grown from that original truck which is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.649 
grown from that original truck which is
a<00:01:36.570> very<00:01:36.840> common<00:01:37.110> occurrence<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:38.119> old<00:01:39.119> apple

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a very common occurrence right old apple

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
a very common occurrence right old apple
trees<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.560> haven't<00:01:40.860> been<00:01:40.890> heavily

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
trees if they haven't been heavily

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.149 
trees if they haven't been heavily
pruned<00:01:42.240> managed<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.920> large

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
pruned managed then they get this large

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.219 
pruned managed then they get this large
crown<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> root<00:01:45.180> systems<00:01:45.630> aren't<00:01:45.930> very

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
crown and the root systems aren't very

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
crown and the root systems aren't very
durable<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.579> lost

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
durable so they get lost

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
durable so they get lost
fall<00:01:48.630> over<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.710> often<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> end<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
fall over and that often is the end of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
fall over and that often is the end of
them<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.560> tree

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
them right so I guess because this tree

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
them right so I guess because this tree
was<00:01:52.979> already<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.720> internationally<00:01:54.720> important

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
was already so internationally important

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
was already so internationally important
it<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.280> protected<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> encouraged

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it was it was protected and encouraged

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.319 
it was it was protected and encouraged
to<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.549> still<00:01:59.759> here<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.119> still

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
to go on so it's still here we can still

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.730 
to go on so it's still here we can still
save<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.719> Chisholm<00:02:00.990> JJ<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.649> to

look I'll please I've been wanting to
see<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.930> tree<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.439> years<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> years<00:02:05.280> it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
see this tree for years and years it's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580 
see this tree for years and years it's
like<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> hit<00:02:06.509> list<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> most

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
like on the hit list of some of the most

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979 
like on the hit list of some of the most
important<00:02:08.129> reasons<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.489> world<00:02:08.700> yeah<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
important reasons in world yeah this is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.279 
important reasons in world yeah this is
it

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.920 
it
that's<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.039> okay

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that's it okay

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.470 
that's it okay
so<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.519> actually<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:17.480> Newton

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so this is actually one of the Newton

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.020 
so this is actually one of the Newton
graphs<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.799> yes<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> direct<00:02:20.700> cutting

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
graphs it is yes it's a direct cutting

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.479 
graphs it is yes it's a direct cutting
from<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.329> original<00:02:22.019> flower<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.409> kin<00:02:22.590> tree<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
from the original flower of kin tree to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.619 
from the original flower of kin tree to
try<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.790> save<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.299> future

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
try and save it for the future

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.710 
try and save it for the future
Wow<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> eat<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.879> his<00:02:27.000> apples<00:02:27.450> yeah

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
Wow so can I eat one of his apples yeah

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.000 
Wow so can I eat one of his apples yeah
please<00:02:28.019> do<00:02:28.200> yeah<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:30.030> exciting<00:02:30.890> what's<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
please do yeah it's exciting what's it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.550 
please do yeah it's exciting what's it
taste<00:02:32.159> like<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:33.420> cost<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> flavorless

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
taste like they cost as a flavorless

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
taste like they cost as a flavorless
cooker<00:02:35.189> it's<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.819> little<00:02:36.359> bit<00:02:36.510> bitter<00:02:40.939> it's<00:02:41.939> not

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
cooker it's a little bit bitter it's not

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.199 
cooker it's a little bit bitter it's not
flavorless<00:02:42.840> at<00:02:43.049> all<00:02:43.700> okay<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:45.090> our

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
flavorless at all okay like it our

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.990 
flavorless at all okay like it our
sheets<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.780> sharp<00:02:46.560> mmm<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.760> term

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
sheets it's sharp mmm I think the term

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.319 
sheets it's sharp mmm I think the term
but<00:02:48.480> quite<00:02:48.920> quite<00:02:49.920> acceptable<00:02:50.489> they're<00:02:51.150> not

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
but quite quite acceptable they're not

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.030 
but quite quite acceptable they're not
bad<00:02:51.510> it's<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.810> very<00:02:51.989> early<00:02:52.470> variety<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.370> Oh

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
bad it's a very early variety so Oh

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
bad it's a very early variety so Oh
since<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.159> played<00:02:56.310> such<00:02:56.549> an<00:02:56.670> important<00:02:57.030> role

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
since it played such an important role

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.960 
since it played such an important role
in<00:02:57.599> science<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.620> think<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.040> excused<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.609> little

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
in science I think we excused a little

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.550 
in science I think we excused a little
tartness<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.659> one's<00:03:03.900> about<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.290> form

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
tartness so this one's about this form

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250 
tartness so this one's about this form
yes<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:05.609> we've<00:03:05.700> got<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.120> tree<00:03:06.569> yes

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
yes and then we've got this tree yes

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.610 
yes and then we've got this tree yes
which<00:03:07.709> again<00:03:07.859> isn't<00:03:08.689> it<00:03:09.689> is<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:10.470> it's

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
which again isn't it is it again it's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.440 
which again isn't it is it again it's
another<00:03:10.709> cutting<00:03:11.280> from<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.639> original<00:03:12.150> tree

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
another cutting from the original tree

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.509 
another cutting from the original tree
but<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.379> say<00:03:13.530> completely<00:03:13.980> different<00:03:14.430> in

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
but as you say completely different in

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.750 
but as you say completely different in
height<00:03:14.760> size<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.720> fruit<00:03:16.160> yeah<00:03:17.160> everything's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
height size of fruit yeah everything's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.939 
height size of fruit yeah everything's
different<00:03:18.000> yeah<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.410> by<00:03:19.560> weed<00:03:19.739> down

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
different yeah I think it's by weed down

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.949 
different yeah I think it's by weed down
to<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.250> root<00:03:20.400> spot<00:03:20.699> most<00:03:21.299> likely<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> mean

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to the root spot most likely I mean

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.550 
to the root spot most likely I mean
we've<00:03:22.590> got<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.239> gene<00:03:24.239> poor<00:03:24.569> flower<00:03:25.319> of

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
we've got this one gene poor flower of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.449 
we've got this one gene poor flower of
Kent<00:03:25.829> yep

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
Kent yep

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.159 
Kent yep
but<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.359> on<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.660> different<00:03:27.810> type

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
but then if you put on a different type

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.949 
but then if you put on a different type
of<00:03:28.199> root<00:03:28.530> stock<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.819> have<00:03:30.000> quite<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> fast

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
of root stock you can have quite a fast

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.800 
of root stock you can have quite a fast
growing<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.560> big<00:03:32.040> standard-type<00:03:32.940> huge<00:03:33.540> tree

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
growing and big standard-type huge tree

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.059 
growing and big standard-type huge tree
or<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> quite<00:03:34.560> shrub<00:03:35.370> bass<00:03:36.139> squat<00:03:37.139> tree<00:03:37.379> oh<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
or a quite shrub bass squat tree oh I

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.140 
or a quite shrub bass squat tree oh I
think<00:03:38.129> that's<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.609> difference<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.060> that's

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
think that's the difference and that's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.819 
think that's the difference and that's
why<00:03:39.480> they<00:03:39.750> choose<00:03:39.989> different<00:03:40.409> roots<00:03:40.590> dogs<00:03:42.829> so

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
why they choose different roots dogs so

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.740 
why they choose different roots dogs so
we<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:43.979> get<00:03:44.190> such<00:03:44.459> different<00:03:45.060> forms<00:03:45.419> from<00:03:45.569> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
we can get such different forms from the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.830 
we can get such different forms from the
exact<00:03:46.109> same<00:03:46.379> species<00:03:46.889> of<00:03:47.250> tree<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:48.780> would

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
exact same species of tree that would

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.509 
exact same species of tree that would
explain<00:03:49.109> why<00:03:49.229> every<00:03:49.680> single<00:03:49.979> one<00:03:50.099> here<00:03:50.400> is

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
explain why every single one here is

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.039 
explain why every single one here is
sort<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.819> different<00:03:51.299> shade<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.690> different

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
sort of a different shade in different

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.809 
sort of a different shade in different
size<00:03:52.699> makes<00:03:53.699> sense<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.750> please<00:03:55.290> now<00:03:55.699> put<00:03:56.699> me

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
size makes sense so please now put me

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.020 
size makes sense so please now put me
out<00:03:56.930> take<00:03:57.930> me<00:03:58.199> to<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.889> mother<00:03:59.099> tree<00:03:59.489> no

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
out take me to the mother tree no

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.199 
out take me to the mother tree no
problem<00:04:00.329> it's<00:04:00.419> always<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.900> over<00:04:01.139> here<00:04:01.760> Wow<00:04:02.819> I

problem it's always just over here Wow I

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.009 
problem it's always just over here Wow I
know<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.470> smacks<00:04:04.859> of<00:04:05.099> ancientness

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
know that just smacks of ancientness

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.080 
know that just smacks of ancientness
I've<00:04:07.019> not<00:04:07.290> seen<00:04:07.650> an<00:04:07.799> apple<00:04:08.129> tree<00:04:08.220> quite<00:04:08.609> so

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
I've not seen an apple tree quite so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.860 
I've not seen an apple tree quite so
grandly<00:04:09.840> old-looking<00:04:10.590> as<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:12.569> when<00:04:12.750> did

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
grandly old-looking as that so when did

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.469 
grandly old-looking as that so when did
fall<00:04:13.139> over<00:04:13.319> how<00:04:13.440> long<00:04:13.620> ago<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.829> was<00:04:14.069> about

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
fall over how long ago that was about

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:20.029 
fall over how long ago that was about
1842<00:04:15.479> 1846<00:04:16.349> so<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.880> by<00:04:18.060> 150<00:04:18.870> year<00:04:19.019> old<00:04:19.139> material

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
1842 1846 so so by 150 year old material

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.099 
1842 1846 so so by 150 year old material
coming<00:04:20.340> up<00:04:20.489> which<00:04:20.820> looks<00:04:21.359> about<00:04:21.659> right<00:04:21.870> for

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
coming up which looks about right for

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.430 
coming up which looks about right for
the<00:04:22.200> age<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:22.789> that<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:24.060> an<00:04:24.539> ancient<00:04:24.900> looking

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
the age and that is an ancient looking

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.240 
the age and that is an ancient looking
apple<00:04:25.740> tree

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
apple tree

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.220 
apple tree
that's<00:04:26.430> just<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.760> branch<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.450> original<00:04:27.840> yes

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
that's just a branch of the original yes

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.250 
that's just a branch of the original yes
yeah<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> as<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.090> went<00:04:30.270> over<00:04:30.450> one<00:04:30.930> branch

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
yeah so as that went over one branch

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.790 
yeah so as that went over one branch
survived<00:04:32.060> rooted<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.360> grew<00:04:33.690> up<00:04:33.870> continues<00:04:34.710> to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
survived rooted and grew up continues to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.070 
survived rooted and grew up continues to
grow<00:04:34.950> which<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.310> amazing<00:04:36.210> there's<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:36.960> much

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
grow which is amazing there's so much

character absolutely go around and look

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.970 
character absolutely go around and look
at<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.720> from<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.230> other<00:04:40.350> side<00:04:40.620> as<00:04:40.740> well<00:04:40.920> but

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
at the from the other side as well but

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.820 
at the from the other side as well but
and<00:04:41.760> it's<00:04:41.970> still<00:04:42.210> got<00:04:42.480> one<00:04:43.140> or<00:04:43.290> two<00:04:43.320> apples

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and it's still got one or two apples

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.030 
and it's still got one or two apples
left<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.460> yes<00:04:44.790> yes<00:04:45.090> do<00:04:45.330> producers<00:04:45.740> hang<00:04:46.740> on

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
left on it yes yes do producers hang on

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:55.520 
left on it yes yes do producers hang on
the<00:04:47.190> phone<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:53.120> sort<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.150> imagined<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:54.960> when

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
the phone I sort of imagined that when

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.470 
the phone I sort of imagined that when
he<00:04:55.770> was<00:04:55.920> sitting<00:04:56.130> under<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.670> tree<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.030> either

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
he was sitting under the tree and either

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.180 
he was sitting under the tree and either
the<00:04:57.780> apple<00:04:58.080> fell<00:04:58.260> on<00:04:58.410> his<00:04:58.530> head<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.770> he<00:04:58.860> saw<00:04:59.040> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
the apple fell on his head or he saw it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.370 
the apple fell on his head or he saw it
fall<00:04:59.430> he<00:05:00.120> was<00:05:00.270> leaning<00:05:00.480> against<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:00.990> tree<00:05:01.230> that

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
fall he was leaning against a tree that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.530 
fall he was leaning against a tree that
looked<00:05:01.620> more<00:05:01.890> like<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.730> one<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.090> just<00:05:03.120> laughs

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
looked more like the one we just laughs

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.960 
looked more like the one we just laughs
I<00:05:03.870> would<00:05:04.169> say<00:05:04.350> so<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.710> more<00:05:04.919> standard<00:05:05.520> type<00:05:05.700> tree

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
I would say so a more standard type tree

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.820 
I would say so a more standard type tree
trunk<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.870> can<00:05:06.990> actually<00:05:07.290> lean<00:05:07.470> against

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
trunk that you can actually lean against

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.060 
trunk that you can actually lean against
it<00:05:08.040> be<00:05:08.850> a<00:05:08.880> bit<00:05:09.230> you<00:05:10.230> wouldn't<00:05:10.530> want<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.919> lean

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it be a bit you wouldn't want to lean

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.710 
it be a bit you wouldn't want to lean
against<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.580> tree<00:05:11.790> that's<00:05:12.090> all<00:05:12.240> squat<00:05:12.540> like

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
against the tree that's all squat like

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.930 
against the tree that's all squat like
this<00:05:12.900> really<00:05:13.140> just<00:05:13.919> have<00:05:14.070> branches<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.700> twigs

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
this really just have branches and twigs

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.080 
this really just have branches and twigs
in<00:05:15.240> your<00:05:15.360> face<00:05:15.890> absolutely<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.669> writings

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
in your face absolutely and the writings

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.090 
in your face absolutely and the writings
do<00:05:18.270> suggest<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:18.780> didn't<00:05:19.110> necessarily<00:05:19.260> fall<00:05:19.860> on

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
do suggest it didn't necessarily fall on

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.800 
do suggest it didn't necessarily fall on
his<00:05:20.460> head<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:20.790> was<00:05:20.910> an<00:05:21.210> apple<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.630> he

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
his head it was an apple that he

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.540 
his head it was an apple that he
observed<00:05:22.200> fall<00:05:22.620> yeah<00:05:22.950> he<00:05:23.100> wondered<00:05:23.370> why<00:05:23.490> it

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
observed fall yeah he wondered why it

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.520 
observed fall yeah he wondered why it
went<00:05:23.669> down<00:05:23.970> his<00:05:24.240> tennis<00:05:24.540> sideways<00:05:24.960> or<00:05:25.140> up<00:05:25.290> or

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
went down his tennis sideways or up or

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.830 
went down his tennis sideways or up or
anywhere<00:05:25.800> else<00:05:25.830> then<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.940> yeah<00:05:27.180> humble<00:05:27.480> Apple

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
anywhere else then so yeah humble Apple

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.659 
anywhere else then so yeah humble Apple
that<00:05:28.130> amazing<00:05:29.130> isn't<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
that amazing isn't it

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.090 
that amazing isn't it
just<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:30.270> little<00:05:30.990> app<00:05:31.140> like<00:05:31.350> this<00:05:31.560> can<00:05:31.830> just

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
just a little app like this can just

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.000 
just a little app like this can just
change<00:05:32.520> our<00:05:32.760> perception<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.990> our<00:05:34.110> level<00:05:34.979> of
