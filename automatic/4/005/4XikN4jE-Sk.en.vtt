00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.549 
the way he is with his family the way he
is<00:01:01.580> so<00:01:01.790> close<00:01:02.150> that's<00:01:02.629> just<00:01:02.930> something<00:01:03.200> that<00:01:03.379> I

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
is so close that's just something that I

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.160 
is so close that's just something that I
look<00:01:03.980> for<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.489> I'm<00:01:04.790> very<00:01:05.170> family-oriented

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
look for and I'm very family-oriented

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.230 
look for and I'm very family-oriented
and<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.650> makes<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.040> huge<00:01:07.310> difference<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:08.119> a

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
and that makes a huge difference in a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.510 
and that makes a huge difference in a
relationship<00:01:08.990> what<00:01:09.410> that<00:01:09.710> showed<00:01:09.979> me<00:01:10.130> was<00:01:10.310> how

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
relationship what that showed me was how

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.760 
relationship what that showed me was how
important<00:01:10.910> family<00:01:11.090> was<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.720> her<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.259> don't

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
important family was to her I don't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.190 
important family was to her I don't
think<00:01:12.860> they<00:01:13.430> could<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.790> found<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.330> guy<00:01:14.630> better

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
think they could have found a guy better

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.209 
think they could have found a guy better
than<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:15.890> found<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:16.700> myself

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.740 

we're<00:01:28.219> throughout<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.789> whole<00:01:28.969> long<00:01:29.479> distance

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
we're throughout the whole long distance

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.139 
we're throughout the whole long distance
we<00:01:30.530> had<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.920> find<00:01:31.159> something<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.610> was<00:01:31.850> we<00:01:32.119> had

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
we had to find something that was we had

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.420 
we had to find something that was we had
in<00:01:32.509> common<00:01:32.960> which<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.590> keeping<00:01:33.950> really

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430

don't<00:01:36.409> think<00:01:36.710> that's<00:01:36.860> ever<00:01:37.100> Dave<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.789> by<00:01:38.030> that

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
don't think that's ever Dave and by that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.899 
don't think that's ever Dave and by that
