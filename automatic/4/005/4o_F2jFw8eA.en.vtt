finally see something they can connect

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
finally see something they can connect
with<00:01:48.750> budgie<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.399> truth<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.909> revealed

with budgie will the truth be revealed

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and will the father's prejudice get in

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.100 
and will the father's prejudice get in
the<00:01:53.490> way<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> where<00:01:54.090> he<00:01:54.240> says<00:01:54.509> he<00:01:54.689> doesn't<00:01:54.930> have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the way to where he says he doesn't have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.249 
the way to where he says he doesn't have
a<00:01:55.259> son<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.310> stuff<00:01:56.750> yes

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
a son and all that other stuff yes

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.920 
a son and all that other stuff yes
but<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:59.039> actually<00:01:59.729> done<00:02:00.060> pretty<00:02:00.299> good<00:02:00.719> here

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
but it's actually done pretty good here

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
but it's actually done pretty good here
the<00:02:01.530> only<00:02:01.649> thing<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.189> think<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.759> why

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the only thing I can think of as to why

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.179 
the only thing I can think of as to why
it<00:02:03.270> works<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.500> other<00:02:04.740> stories

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it works here and not in other stories

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.029 
it works here and not in other stories
is<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.119> pacing<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.409> good

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
is that the pacing is just so good

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
is that the pacing is just so good
in<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.460> every<00:02:08.880> single<00:02:09.090> time<00:02:09.420> something

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
in that every single time something

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.660 
in that every single time something
happens

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
happens

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.089 
happens
you<00:02:10.729> see<00:02:11.060> how<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.480> affects<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.110> character<00:02:12.740> you

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
you see how it affects the character you

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.070 
you see how it affects the character you
see<00:02:13.130> when<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.670> boy<00:02:13.849> learns<00:02:14.270> something<00:02:14.690> that

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
just comes from the fact that they take

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.979 
just comes from the fact that they take
the<00:02:57.980> time<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.400> let<00:02:58.640> us<00:02:58.790> know<00:02:59.030> these<00:02:59.299> people<00:02:59.660> and

don't<00:03:23.840> know<00:03:23.930> what<00:03:24.290> they<00:03:24.440> did<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:25.130> they<00:03:25.430> did<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
don't know what they did how they did it

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.330 
don't know what they did how they did it
but<00:03:26.090> more<00:03:26.510> movies<00:03:26.870> need<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.260> do<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.590> or<00:03:27.890> at<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
but more movies need to do it or at the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.460 
but more movies need to do it or at the
very<00:03:28.370> least<00:03:28.640> re-release<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.900> movie<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.350> we

very least re-release this movie so we

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.949 
very least re-release this movie so we
can<00:03:30.620> see<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:30.890> again<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.370> IMAX<00:03:31.760> 3d<00:03:31.970> cuz<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.810> know<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
can see it again in IMAX 3d cuz I know a

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.630 
can see it again in IMAX 3d cuz I know a
lot<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.440> people<00:03:33.709> who<00:03:33.799> didn't<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.340> way

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
lot of people who didn't see it that way

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.250 
lot of people who didn't see it that way
and<00:03:34.790> they<00:03:34.910> should<00:03:35.209> see<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.810> way

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
and they should see it that way

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.660 
and they should see it that way
but<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> great<00:03:36.859> thing<00:03:37.010> about<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.340> film<00:03:37.549> is

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
but the great thing about the film is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.490 
but the great thing about the film is
even<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.120> take<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.480> aspect<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.320> it

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
even if you take that aspect out of it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.349 
even if you take that aspect out of it
it's<00:03:39.739> still<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.160> good<00:03:40.459> story<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.150> there's

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
it's still a good story and there's

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's still a good story and there's
still<00:03:41.660> good<00:03:41.959> characters<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:43.130> one<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
still good characters it's one of the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.530 
still good characters it's one of the
few<00:03:43.579> movies<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.030> can<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.359> this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
few movies that can have this

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.449 
few movies that can have this
combination<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.230> things<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.739> usually<00:03:46.280> don't

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
combination of things I usually don't

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.849 
combination of things I usually don't
like<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.120> can<00:03:47.299> somehow<00:03:47.540> really<00:03:48.200> pull<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.650> off

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
like and can somehow really pull it off

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.640 
like and can somehow really pull it off
it<00:03:49.489> can<00:03:49.640> be<00:03:49.760> funny<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.299> can<00:03:50.359> be<00:03:50.630> harsh<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.320> it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
it can be funny it can be harsh and it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.400 
it can be funny it can be harsh and it
can<00:03:51.799> be<00:03:51.920> very<00:03:52.370> very<00:03:52.670> genuine<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.870> one<00:03:54.109> problem

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
can be very very genuine the one problem

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.199 
can be very very genuine the one problem
I<00:03:54.650> have<00:03:54.829> with<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.160> film<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.549> once<00:03:55.760> we<00:03:55.910> revealed

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
I have with the film is once we revealed

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.780 
I have with the film is once we revealed
exactly<00:03:56.450> how<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.079> Dragons<00:03:57.799> work<00:03:58.160> even<00:03:58.760> to

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
exactly how the Dragons work even to

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.120 
exactly how the Dragons work even to
this<00:03:59.030> day<00:03:59.269> I'm<00:03:59.480> sort<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.780> confused<00:04:00.350> how<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.859> all

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
this day I'm sort of confused how it all

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.099 
this day I'm sort of confused how it all
goes<00:04:01.400> down<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.299> there's<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.540> giant

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
goes down it's like there's a giant

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.780 
goes down it's like there's a giant
dragon<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.769> all<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> little<00:04:04.280> dragons<00:04:04.670> have

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
dragon and all the little dragons have

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.400 
dragon and all the little dragons have
to<00:04:04.940> feed<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.359> giant<00:04:05.750> dragon<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.260> they're

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
to feed that giant dragon so they're

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.090 
to feed that giant dragon so they're
kind<00:04:07.069> of<00:04:07.310> slaves<00:04:07.880> but<00:04:08.600> they<00:04:08.840> can<00:04:09.230> just<00:04:09.260> fly<00:04:09.859> off

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
kind of slaves but they can just fly off

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.340 
kind of slaves but they can just fly off
if<00:04:10.400> they<00:04:10.579> wanted<00:04:11.060> couldn't<00:04:11.690> they<00:04:11.810> why<00:04:12.049> do<00:04:12.109> they

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
if they wanted couldn't they why do they

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.500 
if they wanted couldn't they why do they
have<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.530> return<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.430> dragon<00:04:14.030> why<00:04:14.450> is

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
have to return to this dragon why is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.360 
have to return to this dragon why is
that<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.139> reason<00:04:15.440> they<00:04:15.560> have<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.829> attack<00:04:16.070> the

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
that the reason they have to attack the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.909 
that the reason they have to attack the
people<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:17.090> pretty<00:04:17.450> confusing<00:04:17.959> but<00:04:18.620> once

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
people it's pretty confusing but once

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.259 
people it's pretty confusing but once
again<00:04:19.039> they<00:04:19.310> make<00:04:19.459> up<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:19.849> with<00:04:19.970> just

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
again they make up for that with just

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.900 
again they make up for that with just
how<00:04:20.510> creative<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.289> cool

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910

personality<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.920> said<00:04:30.100> before<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.520> lot<00:04:30.550> of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
personality like I said before a lot of

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.270 
personality like I said before a lot of
time<00:04:31.600> went<00:04:31.900> into<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.230> details<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:33.010> film

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
time went into the details of this film

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.710 
time went into the details of this film
I<00:04:33.550> think<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.120> just<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.390> straight-up

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
I think it's just a straight-up

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.170 
I think it's just a straight-up
wonderful<00:04:35.560> flick<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:36.310> at<00:04:36.520> any<00:04:36.670> point<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.030> can

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
wonderful flick if at any point you can

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.510 
wonderful flick if at any point you can
see<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.540> in<00:04:37.690> IMAX<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.260> 3d<00:04:38.680> definitely<00:04:39.340> take

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
see it in IMAX in 3d definitely take

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.550 
see it in IMAX in 3d definitely take
advantage<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.600> if<00:04:40.750> not<00:04:40.900> it's<00:04:41.260> still<00:04:41.530> a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
advantage of it but if not it's still a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.280 
advantage of it but if not it's still a
great<00:04:41.800> film<00:04:42.130> regardless
