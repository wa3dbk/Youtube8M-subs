some people to not really like your

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.719 
some people to not really like your
piercing<00:05:45.690> my<00:05:46.380> parents<00:05:46.800> don't<00:05:46.950> like<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.280> I'm<00:05:47.430> 20

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
piercing my parents don't like it I'm 20

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.490 
piercing my parents don't like it I'm 20
years<00:05:47.760> old<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:48.390> can<00:05:48.600> you<00:05:48.780> know<00:05:48.810> do<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.229> want

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
they've gotten more used to it so it's

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.830 
they've gotten more used to it so it's
not<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.700> big<00:05:53.850> deal<00:05:53.910> in<00:05:54.210> my<00:05:54.240> house<00:05:54.510> but

before<00:06:19.180> I<00:06:19.210> go<00:06:19.330> to<00:06:19.389> work<00:06:19.569> I<00:06:19.750> just<00:06:20.050> flip<00:06:20.289> it<00:06:20.379> up

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
before I go to work I just flip it up

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.399 
before I go to work I just flip it up
like<00:06:21.099> this<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.729> just<00:06:21.789> kind<00:06:22.750> of<00:06:22.900> push<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.139> up

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
like this and just kind of push it up

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.409 
like this and just kind of push it up
into<00:06:23.590> this<00:06:23.979> part<00:06:24.250> of<00:06:24.340> my<00:06:24.490> nose<00:06:24.699> if<00:06:25.090> that<00:06:25.240> makes

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
into this part of my nose if that makes

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:25.740 
into this part of my nose if that makes
sense

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
sense

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.279 
sense
and<00:06:25.930> you<00:06:26.590> really<00:06:26.889> can't<00:06:27.159> even<00:06:27.460> see<00:06:27.819> it

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
and you really can't even see it

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.450 
and you really can't even see it
throughout<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.470> day<00:06:29.620> if<00:06:29.889> you<00:06:30.009> can<00:06:30.129> see<00:06:30.280> right

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
throughout the day if you can see right

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.100 
throughout the day if you can see right
there<00:06:30.490> it<00:06:30.879> kind<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.240> falls<00:06:31.449> down<00:06:31.690> like<00:06:31.900> that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
there it kind of falls down like that

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.240 
there it kind of falls down like that
but<00:06:32.979> I<00:06:33.220> just<00:06:33.430> kind<00:06:33.639> of<00:06:33.849> pushed<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.419> back<00:06:34.539> up<00:06:34.750> and

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
but I just kind of pushed it back up and

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.409 
but I just kind of pushed it back up and
you<00:06:36.250> can't<00:06:36.430> really<00:06:36.520> see<00:06:36.639> it<00:06:36.849> so<00:06:37.060> that<00:06:37.180> was

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
you can't really see it so that was

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.119 
you can't really see it so that was
pretty<00:06:37.569> much<00:06:37.719> it<00:06:37.810> guys<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.409> think<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:39.039> I

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
pretty much it guys I think that I

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:41.279 
pretty much it guys I think that I
covered<00:06:39.550> everything<00:06:39.969> I<00:06:40.539> just<00:06:40.900> kind<00:06:41.110> of<00:06:41.169> give

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
covered everything I just kind of give

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.860 
covered everything I just kind of give
you<00:06:41.379> a<00:06:41.409> little<00:06:41.650> overview<00:06:41.919> it<00:06:42.550> did<00:06:42.729> hurt<00:06:43.030> but<00:06:43.569> I

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
you a little overview it did hurt but I

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.570 
you a little overview it did hurt but I
think<00:06:44.139> that<00:06:44.319> it<00:06:44.740> was<00:06:44.860> definitely<00:06:45.159> worth<00:06:45.340> it

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
think that it was definitely worth it

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.490 
think that it was definitely worth it
the<00:06:46.120> healing<00:06:46.300> process<00:06:46.719> is<00:06:46.840> pretty<00:06:47.080> easy<00:06:47.289> just

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
the healing process is pretty easy just

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.920 
the healing process is pretty easy just
make<00:06:47.860> sure<00:06:48.009> to<00:06:48.159> use<00:06:48.310> a<00:06:48.699> sea<00:06:49.090> salt<00:06:49.330> spray<00:06:49.479> or
