00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
wood table using sun block

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.760 
wood table using sun block
that's<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.270> do

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
that's what that is what I'm going to do

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
that's what that is what I'm going to do
so<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.370> step<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.510> little

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so the first step is to use a little

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.670 
so the first step is to use a little
amount<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.590> sun<00:00:37.980> block<00:00:39.079> it<00:00:40.079> might<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
amount of sun block it might be a little

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.810 
amount of sun block it might be a little
too<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.460> take<00:00:41.879> some<00:00:42.210> put<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> thin<00:00:43.820> layer
