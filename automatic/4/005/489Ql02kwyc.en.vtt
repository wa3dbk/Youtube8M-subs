bottom part of the image is urethane

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400 
bottom part of the image is urethane
rubber<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.970> top<00:00:06.270> part<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> image<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
rubber and the top part of the image the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.259 
rubber and the top part of the image the
mold<00:00:07.589> cavity<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> top<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.519> latex<00:00:09.059> rubber

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
mold cavity on the top is latex rubber

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.540 
mold cavity on the top is latex rubber
and<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.530> there's<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.800> significant

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and you can see there's a significant

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.180 
and you can see there's a significant
difference<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.630> texture<00:00:12.960> quality<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
difference in the texture quality the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.910 
difference in the texture quality the
urethane<00:00:15.089> rubber<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.570> muted<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.170> texture<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
urethane rubber is muted and texture the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.130 
urethane rubber is muted and texture the
latex<00:00:17.310> rubber<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.600> very<00:00:18.779> simple

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
latex rubber is not and it's very simple

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.349 
latex rubber is not and it's very simple
because<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:20.160> latex<00:00:20.520> rubber<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.210> need

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
because with latex rubber you don't need

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
because with latex rubber you don't need
to<00:00:21.480> use<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> release<00:00:22.020> agent<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.310> urethane

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to use a release agent and with urethane

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
to use a release agent and with urethane
you<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.539> transfers<00:00:24.990> over<00:00:25.109> into<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you do and that transfers over into the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
you do and that transfers over into the
finished<00:00:25.859> product<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.029> urethane

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
finished product and also with urethane

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.259 
finished product and also with urethane
you<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> lot<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> bug<00:00:28.500> holes<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
you get a lot of bug holes in them and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
you get a lot of bug holes in them and
those<00:00:30.269> bug<00:00:30.570> holes<00:00:30.689> transfer<00:00:31.320> into<00:00:31.529> your<00:00:31.560> stone

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
those bug holes transfer into your stone

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.700 
those bug holes transfer into your stone
veneer<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:33.540> bug<00:00:33.719> holes<00:00:33.840> again<00:00:34.170> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
veneer into little bug holes again this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
veneer into little bug holes again this
little<00:00:35.040> pockets<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> air<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> were<00:00:36.239> trapped

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
little pockets of air that were trapped

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
little pockets of air that were trapped
that's<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> nature<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> beast<00:00:38.040> when

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that's just the nature of the beast when

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
that's just the nature of the beast when
you<00:00:38.430> make<00:00:38.579> urethane<00:00:38.969> molds<00:00:39.360> air<00:00:40.170> gets<00:00:40.410> trapped

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you make urethane molds air gets trapped

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
you make urethane molds air gets trapped
in<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> has<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> escape<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> once

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in there and it has to escape and once

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.459 
in there and it has to escape and once
the<00:00:42.360> rubber<00:00:42.510> hardens<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> urethane<00:00:43.290> rubber

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the rubber hardens the urethane rubber

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
the rubber hardens the urethane rubber
hardens<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.750> air<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.989> needs<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.320> air

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
hardens the air just needs a little air

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
hardens the air just needs a little air
hole<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.090> see

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
hole so that's what it is you can see

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
hole so that's what it is you can see
here<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.809> playing<00:00:49.079> around<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> molds

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
here I'm playing around with the molds

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
here I'm playing around with the molds
the<00:00:49.920> urethane<00:00:50.280> rubber<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.820> ten<00:00:51.059> times

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the urethane rubber is about ten times

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
the urethane rubber is about ten times
heavier<00:00:51.539> than<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.440> latex<00:00:52.800> rubber<00:00:52.949> mold<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
heavier than the latex rubber mold and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
heavier than the latex rubber mold and
keep<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> mind<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.930> latex<00:00:55.469> rubber<00:00:55.559> mold

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
keep in mind that the latex rubber mold

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
keep in mind that the latex rubber mold

molds they're probably either using
latex<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.560> silicone<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> reproduce

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
latex or silicone so they can reproduce

a lot of fatigue and you can see here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
a lot of fatigue and you can see here
the<00:01:41.759> latex<00:01:42.090> rubber<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.810> sorry<00:01:42.960> folks<00:01:43.229> I'm

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
about that and latex rubber mold I can

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.730 
about that and latex rubber mold I can
hold<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.759> finger<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.740> there's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
hold it up with one finger and there's
no<00:01:53.040> fatigue<00:01:53.369> whatsoever<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.090> lift<00:01:54.240> them

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
no fatigue whatsoever you can lift them

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
no fatigue whatsoever you can lift them
you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.630> carry<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:54.960> around<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.320> day<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can carry them around all day and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.590 
you can carry them around all day and
it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.240> difference

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it's not going you have any difference

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
it's not going you have any difference
on<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:59.009> body<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
on you on your body but you know the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.609 
on you on your body but you know the
urethane<00:02:00.180> rubber<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.320> heavy

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
urethane rubber is just it's just heavy

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.100 
urethane rubber is just it's just heavy
a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.280> heavier<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.180> reason<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a lot heavier and the reason for that is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
a lot heavier and the reason for that is
because<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:05.340> way<00:02:05.430> they're<00:02:05.640> created<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
because the way they're created the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
because the way they're created the
urethane<00:02:07.170> rubber<00:02:07.290> molds<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.740> created<00:02:08.069> by

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
urethane rubber molds are created by

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
urethane rubber molds are created by
pouring<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> rubber<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.149> liquid<00:02:09.479> rubber<00:02:09.660> into

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
pouring the rubber a liquid rubber into

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.400 
pouring the rubber a liquid rubber into
a<00:02:09.989> box<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.860> letting<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> rubber<00:02:11.790> harden<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
a box and letting the rubber harden and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
a box and letting the rubber harden and
then<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.920> pull<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> rubber<00:02:14.370> mold<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
then you pull the rubber mold out as a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.260 
then you pull the rubber mold out as a
whole<00:02:15.870> block<00:02:16.230> mold<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.340> latex<00:02:17.850> rubber<00:02:17.970> mold

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
whole block mold the latex rubber mold

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.820 
whole block mold the latex rubber mold
it<00:02:18.450> takes<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.690> lot<00:02:18.840> longer<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.470> about<00:02:19.590> five

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it takes a lot longer it's about five

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
it takes a lot longer it's about five
times<00:02:20.040> longer<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.580> create<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.880> mold<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
times longer to create a mold but the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480 
times longer to create a mold but the
