out

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160 

any<00:00:40.710> different<00:00:41.159> ways<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.550> doing<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.989> can

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
any different ways of doing this you can

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.959 
any different ways of doing this you can
take<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> longer<00:00:43.679> piece<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> fold<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.940> half

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
take a longer piece and fold it in half

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.189 
take a longer piece and fold it in half
and<00:00:45.510> twist<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.019> many

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
and twist it and so there are many

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.619 
and twist it and so there are many
different<00:00:49.649> ways<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:50.159> this<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.179> find

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
different ways to do this but I find

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.439 
different ways to do this but I find
this<00:00:51.839> very<00:00:52.229> fast<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.280> easy<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.299> have

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this very fast and easy now here I have

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.609 
this very fast and easy now here I have
my<00:00:58.850> my<00:00:59.850> cloud<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.890> roving<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> regular

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
my my cloud of roving in and the regular

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
my my cloud of roving in and the regular
roving<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.119> should<00:01:06.149> say<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> cloud<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> wool

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
roving in I should say the cloud of wool

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
roving in I should say the cloud of wool
and<00:01:07.679> then<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> regular<00:01:08.670> roving<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.960> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and then the regular roving when you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
and then the regular roving when you
have<00:01:10.380> regular<00:01:10.619> roving<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> want

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
have regular roving you're going to want

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.649 
have regular roving you're going to want
to<00:01:11.909> draft<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.319> let<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.679> air<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.659> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to draft it to let the air get in so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.859 
to draft it to let the air get in so
that<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.380> warmer<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.039> you<00:01:17.069> use<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.869> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that will be warmer as you use it and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.029 
that will be warmer as you use it and
just<00:01:18.929> pull<00:01:19.319> it<00:01:19.409> apart<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:22.640> put<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:25.039> so

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
just pull it apart and put it through so

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.139 
just pull it apart and put it through so
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.549> either<00:01:26.789> method<00:01:28.700> now<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.880> going

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
you can use either method now I'm going

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.300 
you can use either method now I'm going
to<00:01:30.270> knit<00:01:30.420> across<00:01:30.569> and<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.069> quite

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to knit across and I'm going to go quite

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.059 
to knit across and I'm going to go quite
slow<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.940> I<00:01:36.149> pull<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.020> after<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.770> first

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
slow and I pull it now after that first

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.719 
slow and I pull it now after that first
row<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.369> knitting<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.830> get<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.340> sure<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
row of knitting to get it make sure it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.210
