00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.739
 test flight with new 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:29.910
 monitor suspension also changed means 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.619
 changed my mouth and balanced 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.579
 screws 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 which don and I were balancing 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 layout such 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.399
 now try to show the transmitter 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.879
 installed down to the antenna down 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.879
 watched 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.100
 Well now let's try to see 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 Well, interference from going for what we try 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.440
 all the rest 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:48.220
 and to you understand deal in antennas or 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.410
 doing than for example like for good 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.710
 hanging hands sticks meter back in place 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.350
 slegonets 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 small drake eat do 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.480
 native antenna removed shepherd since 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.570
 very strong interference that is places with 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.330
 put clover respectively 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.110
 put on the TV by antenna 1 glue 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.670
 another 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.480
 patch antenna let's see how it is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 will affect reception 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.510
 well reflected 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 half an hour before full drive forward was 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.860
 like a picture just perfect 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.650
 no interference 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.120
 This suggests that native sausages 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.120
 turned out to be completely unsuitable 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.520
 harder we could not them right away 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.800
 measure what frequency they are on the wall 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.080
 most likely this does not coincide with 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.590
 those who work to attract or 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.590
 receiver 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.290
 quality is very decent gopro 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:38.250
 how much 2nd is she bad for sky in 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.349
 these are less visible and on TV so 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 You can see the TV and shoot the camera 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.189
 color transfer wonderful night yes him 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.689
 also on the only trips 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.689
 but this is the next stage
