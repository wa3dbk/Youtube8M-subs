antique<00:02:03.030> machines<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:04.259> you're<00:02:04.439> very<00:02:04.649> strong

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
antique machines that you're very strong

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.639

because<00:02:05.759> trying<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> lift<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.079> pretty

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
because trying to lift them is pretty

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
because trying to lift them is pretty
impossible<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> kind<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> need<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> crane<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
