00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.950
 today we are going to make cinnamon roll 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.910
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:23.410
 sugar brown sugar white milk flour 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 cinnamon cream dry yeast 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.510
 baker butter and egg 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.579
 The first thing we are going to do is take a 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.170
 case and put the milk let's take the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.320
 sugar 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.149
 and we are going to also throw the butter and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.149
 we are going to bring it to a boil 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.760
 when the butter has melted 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.390
 let's let it cool down a bit 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 now let's throw in a bowl half 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.910
 of the flour we are going to throw the salt 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.949
 let's take out the dry yeast the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 dry yeast as you see is a color like 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.590
 yellow and they are small granules 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.700
 that if we touch them they fall apart because this one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700
 is what we are going to need 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.990
 let's also throw the eggs and what 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.860
 let's move 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 about 34 minutes approximately once 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.110
 that the eggs the flour have been mixed 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 let's gradually add the mixture 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.640
 of milk butter and sugar and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.439
 we are going to move it is going to stay very 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.700
 sticky but it does not matter because now 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.970
 let's take half the flour 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.320
 when all this mixture is integrated 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.509
 when everything is well mixed we are going to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.820
 finish throwing the flour and now if 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.039
 we will move it about 10 minutes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.119
 approximately until there is a dough 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.119
 pretty compact 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.740
 when we have finished mixing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.940
 well in a container we are going to throw 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.250
 flour 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.780
 oil and we're going to throw the dough here 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.340
 let's leave between an hour and a half and two 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 hours until I double the volume 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.599
 while we are waiting for the dough 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.280
 raise let's make the filling in a bowl 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.400
 let's take flour butter 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.580
 and brown sugar and we will move it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260
 either with a knife or fork until 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.620
 all the ingredients are integrated 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.510
 important that the butter is out 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.220
 from the fridge about 20 minutes so that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.630
 it easier to work with them as 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 we are going to melt the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.190
 once we have everything right 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.410
 mixed let's add cinnamon to 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.480
 everyone's pleasure we're going to 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.850
 take about 4 tablespoons because we like 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.410
 the taste of cinnamon very intense if you 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.460
 I like less intense to throw a little 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.100
 less cinnamon 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.770
 once you have raised the mass now 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.570
 touch pick with a rolling pin and knead it 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.270
 While we have taken what has 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.700
 been putting the kitchen paper under the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.460
 parchment paper pardon under the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.250
 march and we have coated the roller with 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.640
 Also baking paper to prevent 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.420
 it stays stuck let's knead and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 Flatten well 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.590
 once we have already caught the mass and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.170
 we have given it a more or less 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.069
 square as we can we are going to 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.440
 pour the brown sugar mixture 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:36.630
 cinnamon flour and butter 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.630
 and it's going to be all right 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.920
 once we already have well extended 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.269
 the whole chain we're going to take the roll and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.269
 we're going to go rolling 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.730
 now we are going to cut more or less 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.950
 with a number of three fingers 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.280
 we cut and we're going to put in a tray 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.510
 even for one and we will leave one 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.510
 more time to upload 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:11.490
 once the time has passed we have 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.490
 picked up some cream and we're going to paint 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.019
 our cinnamon rolls are going to put 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.519
 the oven to preheat to 190 degrees a 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.280
 Once it's hot, we 're going to put 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.750
 our cinnamon rolls 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.750
 approximately 25 or 30 minutes 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.430
 to make the frosting we are going to throw 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.790
 icing sugar 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.180
 and cream and we will move everything very well 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.360
 good as you see after about 25 or 26 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.160
 minutes we have our roll of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.870
 cinnamon made the truth that we have not 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 gone up pretty much in oblivion so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.330
 a little but it does not matter because sure 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.540
 which is just as good 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.830
 now let's take 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.830
 the icing on top 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.990
 and I would be ready to eat, I hope 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.990
 I like you 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.010
 here
