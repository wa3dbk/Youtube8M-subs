00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:10.880
 There were seven teenage little ones there 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 price 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 at the collector's ndr ticketshop the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.709
 means that both times it seems that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.220
 also to be from the same company 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.890
 the Disney surprise home too 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 a blue capsule exactly the same show 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.020
 choralis cheap chocolate is yes too 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020
 no matter 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.770
 and usually those are the ones in 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.770
 These eggs are still scrap iker 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.660
 and here you have such a collection 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.670
 brand dog tag but it is not 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.239
 So my real dog tag 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.239
 the army with the americans the two 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.260
 I would rather not explain brands like this 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 exactly why the two are twelve pieces 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.690
 are these here, yes, who has collected all 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.050
 to reassign the this is also to 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.070
 in short you can as a key ring or 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:24.950
 so keychains enjoyed no 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.950
 dog tag exactly 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.849
 so that was the turn
