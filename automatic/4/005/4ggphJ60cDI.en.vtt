today<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.269> want<00:00:00.480> to<00:00:00.539> show<00:00:00.659> you<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.840> new<00:00:01.140> feature

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
today I want to show you a new feature

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.409 
today I want to show you a new feature
that<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:01.650> can<00:00:01.770> add<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.129> our<00:00:02.159> scan<00:00:02.580> gage<00:00:02.879> -<00:00:03.210> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
that we can add to our scan gage - the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.900 
that we can add to our scan gage - the
ex<00:00:03.600> gage<00:00:03.870> part<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.410> because<00:00:05.130> we've<00:00:05.609> always

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
ex gage part of it because we've always

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.270 
ex gage part of it because we've always
been<00:00:06.120> able<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> monitor<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> ICP<00:00:07.799> pressure

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
been able to monitor the ICP pressure

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.339 
been able to monitor the ICP pressure
but<00:00:08.940> we've<00:00:09.120> never<00:00:09.480> been<00:00:09.660> able<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.929> monitor<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
but we've never been able to monitor the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.160 
but we've never been able to monitor the
ICP<00:00:10.800> voltage<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.059> contacted<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.750> guys<00:00:12.900> down

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
ICP voltage so I contacted the guys down

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.480 
ICP voltage so I contacted the guys down
there<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.530> they<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> great<00:00:14.040> customer

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
there and they have a great customer

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.369 
there and they have a great customer
service<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.570> explained<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> them<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.230> we

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
service and I explained to them that we

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380 
service and I explained to them that we
really<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> ICP<00:00:17.880> voltage

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
really need to see the ICP voltage

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.620 
really need to see the ICP voltage
sometimes<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.680> reason<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.760> ICP

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
sometimes and the reason is is the ICP

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
sometimes and the reason is is the ICP
or<00:00:21.900> injection<00:00:22.410> control<00:00:22.710> pressure<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.580> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
or injection control pressure if it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880 
or injection control pressure if it's
ever<00:00:24.119> loses<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> signal<00:00:25.080> whether<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
ever loses a signal whether it be from a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.339 
ever loses a signal whether it be from a
bad<00:00:26.070> sensor<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.730> bad<00:00:26.910> wire<00:00:27.300> something's<00:00:28.140> going

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
bad sensor or bad wire something's going

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
bad sensor or bad wire something's going
on<00:00:28.439> there<00:00:28.650> it'll<00:00:29.220> it'll<00:00:29.970> give<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> false

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
on there it'll it'll give you a false

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
on there it'll it'll give you a false
thing<00:00:30.900> it'll<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> substitute<00:00:32.369> ICP

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
thing it'll go in a substitute ICP

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.080 
thing it'll go in a substitute ICP
desired<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> pre-programmed<00:00:34.469> pressure

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
desired or a pre-programmed pressure

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
desired or a pre-programmed pressure
that<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> wants<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.370> you're

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
that it wants to have and so what you're

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
that it wants to have and so what you're
looking<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.820> could<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.059> false<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.020> it'll

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
looking at could be false but it'll

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.830 
looking at could be false but it'll
never<00:00:40.559> give<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.100> ICP<00:00:42.059> voltage<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> I've

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
never give you ICP voltage and I've

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
never give you ICP voltage and I've
never<00:00:42.989> faked<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.579> ICP

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
never faked that so if we look at ICP

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.600 
never faked that so if we look at ICP
voltage<00:00:45.539> key<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> engine<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
voltage key on engine off and we see it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
voltage key on engine off and we see it
roughly<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> quarter<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.780> volt<00:00:49.050> then

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
roughly about a quarter of a volt then

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
roughly about a quarter of a volt then
we<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.950> pretty<00:00:50.399> much<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
we know pretty much from there that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
we know pretty much from there that
everything's<00:00:51.539> accurate<00:00:52.050> sometimes<00:00:52.890> we'll

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
everything's accurate sometimes we'll

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670 
everything's accurate sometimes we'll
see<00:00:53.250> ICP<00:00:53.910> voltage<00:00:54.329> reading<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.320> know<00:00:55.440> real

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
see ICP voltage reading you know real

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.830 
see ICP voltage reading you know real
high<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> half<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> volt<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.690> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
high like a half a volt or more and we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.970 
high like a half a volt or more and we
know<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> problem<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
know that we have a problem then with a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.430 
know that we have a problem then with a
sense<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> signal<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.449> before<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.350> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sense or a signal but before we do have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.229 
sense or a signal but before we do have
a<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> monitor<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a way to monitor it but now we do so I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
a way to monitor it but now we do so I
want<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> show<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
want to do is show you how to go in and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190 
want to do is show you how to go in and
program<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.880> scan<00:01:06.090> gage<00:01:06.360> -<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
program that into your scan gage - so we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.750 
program that into your scan gage - so we
can<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.439> looking<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.710> ICP<00:01:08.189> voltage<00:01:08.580> because

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can start looking at ICP voltage because

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
can start looking at ICP voltage because
it's<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.119> important<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it's pretty important when you have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070 
it's pretty important when you have
drivability<00:01:11.040> issues<00:01:11.240> such<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.270> no<00:01:12.600> starts

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
drivability issues such as no starts

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
drivability issues such as no starts
lack<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> power<00:01:14.280> major<00:01:14.760> lack<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> power<00:01:15.360> no

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lack of power major lack of power no

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
lack of power major lack of power no
start<00:01:16.290> hot<00:01:16.530> sometimes<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> starting<00:01:17.640> weird<00:01:17.850> no

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
start hot sometimes a starting weird no

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
start hot sometimes a starting weird no
throttle<00:01:18.659> response<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.100> good<00:01:20.280> thing<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
throttle response it's a good thing to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
throttle response it's a good thing to
look<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.700> ICP<00:01:21.180> volt<00:01:21.479> each<00:01:21.630> key<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.080> engine<00:01:22.229> off

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
look at ICP volt each key on engine off

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
look at ICP volt each key on engine off
so<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.189> I'll<00:01:23.280> show<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.180> best<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
so here I'll show you the best way I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
so here I'll show you the best way I
know<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.780> program<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.380> real<00:01:25.500> quick<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
know how to program it real quick so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690 
know how to program it real quick so
here<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> scan<00:01:27.810> gage<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> whenever

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
here we have the scan gage and whenever

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.690 
here we have the scan gage and whenever
you<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.549> everything

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you have it and you you got everything

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
you have it and you you got everything
going<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> confused<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.470> hit

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
going on and you get confused just hit

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
going on and you get confused just hit

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the home button here it's kind of like

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
the home button here it's kind of like
the<00:01:36.659> center<00:01:36.840> button<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.290> an<00:01:37.409> iPhone<00:01:37.829> or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the center button on an iPhone or

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
the center button on an iPhone or
whatever<00:01:38.070> it'll<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> start

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
whatever it'll get you back to the start

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.289 
gonna hit go here this way now I'm in
the<00:01:51.600> X<00:01:51.780> gauge<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> edit<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.180> now

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the X gauge I'm gonna go to edit so now

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480 
the X gauge I'm gonna go to edit so now
I'm<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> edit<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.049> find<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.860> empty<00:01:56.009> slot

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
I'm going to edit I find an empty slot

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
I'm going to edit I find an empty slot
number<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.540> has<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.869> empty<00:01:58.049> slot<00:01:58.380> there's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
number one has an empty slot there's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440 
number one has an empty slot there's
nothing<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:01:59.969> edit<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
nothing in there so I'm gonna edit that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
nothing in there so I'm gonna edit that
so<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.469> number<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:01.950> edit<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
so now here I have number one edit and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.359 
so now here I have number one edit and
now<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.689> where<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.200> start<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> enter<00:02:04.799> our<00:02:05.040> code

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
now is where we start to enter our code

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.399 
now is where we start to enter our code
that's<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.020> start<00:02:07.320> looking

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that's up here so we can start looking

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
that's up here so we can start looking
at<00:02:07.560> IC<00:02:07.950> P<00:02:08.700> voltage<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.360> injection<00:02:09.660> controlled

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
at IC P voltage or injection controlled

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.479 
at IC P voltage or injection controlled
pressure<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.200> voltage<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.009> there<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.459> my

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
pressure of voltage a so there I have my

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.540 
pressure of voltage a so there I have my
cursor<00:02:11.879> now

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
cursor now

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.630 
cursor now
now<00:02:13.150> I'm<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> go<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.310> it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
now I'm going to go up on it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.170 
now I'm going to go up on it
I<00:02:15.670> have<00:02:16.120> zero<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:17.200> gonna<00:02:17.380> go<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> right

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
I have zero I'm gonna go to the right

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
I have zero I'm gonna go to the right
and<00:02:19.180> I'm<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.870> go<00:02:19.990> up<00:02:20.140> until<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.440> hit<00:02:20.590> seven

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and I'm going to go up until I hit seven

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.980 
and I'm going to go up until I hit seven
now<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.220> seven<00:02:24.760> I'm<00:02:25.450> gonna<00:02:25.630> go<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.930> time

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
now I have seven I'm gonna go this time

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.270 
now I have seven I'm gonna go this time
go<00:02:26.290> down<00:02:26.530> remember<00:02:26.800> because<00:02:27.070> they're<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
go down remember because they're the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.070 
go down remember because they're the
alphabet<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.730> want<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> go<00:02:28.030> down<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> start

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
alphabet I want to go down so I start

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.750 
alphabet I want to go down so I start
with<00:02:29.170> F<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.220> then<00:02:30.310> E

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
with F and then E

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.700 
with F and then E
it's<00:02:30.970> hard<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.240> tell<00:02:31.480> but<00:02:31.690> make<00:02:31.870> sure<00:02:32.050> or<00:02:32.500> these

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
it's hard to tell but make sure or these

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.200 
it's hard to tell but make sure or these
to<00:02:32.800> be<00:02:32.890> know<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.100> it's<00:02:33.400> apt<00:02:33.550> first<00:02:33.850> then<00:02:34.030> e

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
to be know that it's apt first then e

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.850 
to be know that it's apt first then e
then<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.570> lot<00:02:34.720> better<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.710> zero

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
then it's a lot better so I got zero

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.820 
then it's a lot better so I got zero
seven<00:02:36.310> e<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.060> next<00:02:37.090> one<00:02:37.510> zero<00:02:38.400> next<00:02:39.400> one<00:02:39.670> -<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
seven e the next one zero next one - and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.280 
seven e the next one zero next one - and
then<00:02:41.830> -<00:02:42.130> again<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:43.930> hitting<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
then - again I'm just hitting to the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.730 
then - again I'm just hitting to the
right<00:02:44.700> there<00:02:45.700> one<00:02:47.310> over<00:02:48.310> again<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:50.260> up<00:02:50.410> -<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> get

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
right there one over again go up - I get

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.800 
right there one over again go up - I get
to<00:02:50.860> six<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.380> then<00:02:53.620> go<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:54.070> I'll<00:02:54.220> go<00:02:54.490> down

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
to six and then go to here I'll go down

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.450 
to six and then go to here I'll go down
go<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.110> alphabet<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.920> apple

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
go down the alphabet so I get to apple

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.480 
go down the alphabet so I get to apple
or<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.140> next<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.530> go<00:02:59.920> down<00:03:00.130> until<00:03:00.370> I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
or a and the next one go down until I

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.210 
or a and the next one go down until I
get<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.760> D<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.300> there<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.110> have<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.800> have<00:03:03.010> my

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
get to D so there I have that I have my

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.900 
get to D so there I have that I have my
TX<00:03:04.000> decode<00:03:04.690> all<00:03:04.960> put<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.380> there<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:06.550> can<00:03:06.700> see<00:03:06.820> it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
TX decode all put in there we can see it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.240 
TX decode all put in there we can see it
matches<00:03:07.240> so<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.360> hit<00:03:07.510> OK<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.770> automatically

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
matches so I hit OK and it automatically

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.000 
matches so I hit OK and it automatically
goes<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.670> next<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:09.970> my<00:03:10.180> rxf<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.770> same

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
goes to the next one my rxf so the same

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.510 
goes to the next one my rxf so the same
thing<00:03:12.250> I've<00:03:12.700> got<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> 0<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.630> go<00:03:14.440> over<00:03:14.650> 1<00:03:14.680> we're

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
thing I've got the 0 I go over 1 we're

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:27.710 
thing I've got the 0 I go over 1 we're
going<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.700> go<00:03:15.790> up<00:03:16.709> 4<00:03:19.320> keep<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:21.330> 6<00:03:23.760> 2

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840 

for

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:39.300 

five<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:33.520> we<00:03:33.610> have<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:36.720> six<00:03:37.720> zero

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
five and we have one six zero

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:50.090 
five and we have one six zero
I<00:03:40.830> like<00:03:41.830> zeros<00:03:42.220> six<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.590> down<00:03:45.570> again<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.940 

David<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.670> all<00:03:52.360> those<00:03:52.570> in<00:03:52.900> hit<00:03:53.530> okay

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
David so I have all those in hit okay

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.860 
David so I have all those in hit okay
now<00:03:54.820> I've<00:03:54.940> got<00:03:55.000> an<00:03:55.210> easy<00:03:55.330> one<00:03:55.480> again<00:03:56.550> three

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
now I've got an easy one again three

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.850 
now I've got an easy one again three
zero<00:03:59.070> zero<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:01.390> go<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.720> next<00:04:01.840> one<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.650> go

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
zero zero and go to the next one and go

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.930 
zero zero and go to the next one and go
up<00:04:03.070> until<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> hit<00:04:03.640> feet<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.310> have<00:04:06.550> eight<00:04:06.760> in

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
up until I hit feet now I have eight in

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.960 
up until I hit feet now I have eight in
there<00:04:07.090> hit<00:04:07.600> okay<00:04:08.130> here<00:04:09.130> we<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.520> last<00:04:09.730> one

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
there hit okay here we have the last one

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:19.100 
there hit okay here we have the last one
so<00:04:10.570> I've<00:04:10.660> got<00:04:10.840> zero<00:04:11.290> zero<00:04:12.420> then<00:04:13.420> six<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:17.560> over

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
so I've got zero zero then six go over

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.500 
so I've got zero zero then six go over
four<00:04:20.110> and<00:04:20.640> we<00:04:21.640> got<00:04:21.760> zero<00:04:22.120> zero<00:04:23.220> then<00:04:24.720> three

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
four and we got zero zero then three

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.720 
four and we got zero zero then three
three<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> rest<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.260> zeros<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.580> just

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
three then the rest of zeros so I just

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.360 
three then the rest of zeros so I just
hit<00:04:30.940> okay<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.570> now<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:32.560> time<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.100> put<00:04:33.280> the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
hit okay and now it's time to put the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.920 
hit okay and now it's time to put the
name<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> same<00:04:34.630> way<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:34.870> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
name in in the same way with the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.620 
name in in the same way with the
alphabet<00:04:35.200> we<00:04:35.380> just<00:04:35.560> go<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:36.610> already<00:04:36.730> have<00:04:36.970> ICP

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
alphabet we just go we already have ICP

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.860 
alphabet we just go we already have ICP
in<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.140> I<00:04:38.200> hit<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:41.070> see<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.370> then<00:04:43.060> V<00:04:43.420> for

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
in it so I hit I see and then V for

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.530 
in it so I hit I see and then V for
voltage

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.300 

so<00:04:50.110> they<00:04:50.170> keep<00:04:50.350> on<00:04:50.470> going<00:04:50.680> up<00:04:51.840> tu<00:04:52.840> V<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:54.130> now<00:04:54.220> we

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
so they keep on going up tu V so now we

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.030 
so they keep on going up tu V so now we
have<00:04:54.460> ICP<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.420> see<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.380> injection<00:04:56.830> control

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
have ICP I see the injection control

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.600 
have ICP I see the injection control
pressure<00:04:57.220> sensor<00:04:58.090> voltage<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:58.660> we<00:04:58.690> hit<00:04:58.870> save

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
pressure sensor voltage so we hit save

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.820 
pressure sensor voltage so we hit save
exit<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.570> now<00:05:01.870> we<00:05:01.930> just<00:05:02.140> go<00:05:02.290> back<00:05:02.440> again<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
exit and now we just go back again the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.820 
exit and now we just go back again the
home<00:05:03.010> button<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.970> now<00:05:04.060> we<00:05:04.120> go<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.330> Gage<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.110> we

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
home button so now we go to Gage and we

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.490 
home button so now we go to Gage and we
look<00:05:06.040> at<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:07.500> cycle<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.560> key<00:05:08.740> here<00:05:10.440> turn<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
look at it cycle the key here turn the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.520 
look at it cycle the key here turn the
key<00:05:11.710> on<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.920> there<00:05:12.130> we<00:05:12.280> go<00:05:12.460> we<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.600> quarter

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
key on and there we go we have a quarter

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.190 
key on and there we go we have a quarter
of<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.680> volt<00:05:14.920> roughly<00:05:15.340> 0.23<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.180> ICP<00:05:16.570> volts<00:05:17.110> I

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
of a volt roughly 0.23 of ICP volts I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.070 
of a volt roughly 0.23 of ICP volts I
see<00:05:17.500> P<00:05:18.190> voltage<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:18.970> were<00:05:19.420> able<00:05:19.540> to<00:05:19.690> confirm

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
see P voltage and were able to confirm

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.350 
see P voltage and were able to confirm
it<00:05:20.290> because<00:05:20.410> remember<00:05:21.220> again<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.910> only<00:05:22.060> time

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
it because remember again the only time

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.210 
it because remember again the only time
you<00:05:22.510> can<00:05:22.540> tell<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.080> see<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.890> injection

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
you can tell you I see the injection

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.130 
you can tell you I see the injection
control<00:05:24.430> pressure<00:05:24.580> voltage<00:05:25.090> is<00:05:25.300> key<00:05:25.960> on

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
control pressure voltage is key on

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.990 
control pressure voltage is key on
engine<00:05:26.410> off<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.100> that's<00:05:27.520> where<00:05:27.700> we<00:05:27.790> should

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
engine off and that's where we should

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.150 
engine off and that's where we should
see<00:05:28.180> roughly<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:28.570> quarter<00:05:28.810> volt<00:05:29.230> anywhere<00:05:29.980> from

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
see roughly a quarter volt anywhere from

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.930 
see roughly a quarter volt anywhere from
point<00:05:30.520> one<00:05:30.700> eight<00:05:30.730> to<00:05:31.510> maybe<00:05:32.070> 0.28<00:05:33.070> is<00:05:33.400> where

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
point one eight to maybe 0.28 is where

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.570 
point one eight to maybe 0.28 is where
we<00:05:34.060> want<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.360> see<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.430> again<00:05:36.430> that's

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
we want to see it and again that's

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.190 
we want to see it and again that's
important<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.150> varies<00:05:37.480> too<00:05:37.660> much<00:05:37.810> looking<00:05:38.140> at

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
important it varies too much looking at

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.870 
important it varies too much looking at
it<00:05:38.320> going<00:05:38.440> on<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.680> road<00:05:38.860> under<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.460> throttle

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
it going on the road under the throttle

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.340 
it going on the road under the throttle
but<00:05:40.240> it's<00:05:40.390> going<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.660> change<00:05:40.840> with<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.080> load

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
but it's going to change with a load

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.140 
but it's going to change with a load
type<00:05:41.890> of<00:05:42.040> fuel<00:05:42.250> temperature<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.880> everything

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
type of fuel temperature and everything

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.910 
type of fuel temperature and everything
else<00:05:43.300> so<00:05:44.110> hopefully<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.530> helps<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:44.890> out
