00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
gets center of gravity as you can see

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.330 
gets center of gravity as you can see
here<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> pen<00:00:09.240> itself<00:00:10.490> pilot<00:00:13.250> as<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
here this is the pen itself pilot as you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.530 
here this is the pen itself pilot as you
can<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> already<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.880> an<00:00:15.030> insert<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
can see I already have an insert in it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.810 
can see I already have an insert in it
it's<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.080> very<00:00:16.289> cute<00:00:16.619> insert<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.250> bear<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it's a very cute insert of a bear I

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
it's a very cute insert of a bear I
don't<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.470> it's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
don't know if you can see that but it's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.000 
don't know if you can see that but it's
all<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.070> know<00:00:20.220> I'll<00:00:20.340> Brown<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:21.390> nice

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
all you know I'll Brown it's very nice

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.060 
all you know I'll Brown it's very nice
there<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.100> says<00:00:23.310> doctor<00:00:23.760> rib<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> one

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
there it says doctor rib this one

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
there it says doctor rib this one
actually<00:00:26.220> has<00:00:26.460> dual<00:00:26.730> air<00:00:26.970> grips<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.420> believe

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
actually has dual air grips I believe

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
actually has dual air grips I believe
this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> only<00:00:28.230> American<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> dual

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
this is the only American with the dual

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.910 
this is the only American with the dual
air<00:00:30.029> groups<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.320> American<00:00:31.740> pen

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
air groups but this is an American pen

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
air groups but this is an American pen
and<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.160> can't<00:00:32.399> find<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.940> America<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and you can't find this in America the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
and you can't find this in America the
reason<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.260> call<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.469> center<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.890> gravity<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
reason they call it center of gravity is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
reason they call it center of gravity is
because<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.880> has<00:00:36.000> extra<00:00:36.480> weight<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.899> believe

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
because it has extra weight I believe

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
because it has extra weight I believe
which<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> actually<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> front<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.670> front

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
which is actually in the front the front

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.490 
which is actually in the front the front
seems<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.480> composed<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> mostly<00:00:40.140> metal

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
seems to be composed of mostly metal

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.270 
seems to be composed of mostly metal
which<00:00:41.989> does<00:00:42.989> something<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> particular<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
which does something in particular it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.920 
which does something in particular it
may<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.670> maybe<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> helps<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> write<00:00:45.629> better

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
may be maybe it helps you write better

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
may be maybe it helps you write better
maybe<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
maybe it's not so like you know you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.220 
maybe it's not so like you know you're
holding<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> back<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
holding it like this and the back is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
holding it like this and the back is
like<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.930> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
like all the way down you're like you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.600 
like all the way down you're like you
know<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.059> my

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
know back so I don't even know put on my

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.920 
know back so I don't even know put on my
structurally<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.059> very<00:00:57.300> similar<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
structurally this is very similar to the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
structurally this is very similar to the
new<00:00:58.140> version<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.620> Japanese<00:00:59.399> doctor<00:01:00.000> hip

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
ring here and it's small in metal as you
can<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> clip<00:01:17.549> big

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
can see on the back we have a clip big

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
can see on the back we have a clip big
plus<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.780> particular<00:01:19.049> clip<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
plus but this particular clip which is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.380 
plus but this particular clip which is
also<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> full<00:01:20.700> white<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> full<00:01:21.150> black

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
also on the full white and full black

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.740 
also on the full white and full black
those<00:01:21.630> Japanese<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.240> why<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
those Japanese I do not like and why and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
those Japanese I do not like and why and
that's<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> metal<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that's because it's metal and and that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
that's because it's metal and and that
normally<00:01:27.659> isn't<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> problem<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.590> don't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
normally isn't a problem but I don't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
normally isn't a problem but I don't
think<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.920> goes<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> dock<00:01:29.790> trip<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
think it goes out on the dock trip and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
think it goes out on the dock trip and
it's<00:01:30.600> hard<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.229> hard<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> pull<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.250> hard

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it's hard it's hard to pull up it's hard

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.569 
it's hard it's hard to pull up it's hard
to<00:01:32.549> hook<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> things<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.570> annoying<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
to hook on the things it's annoying I

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.010 
to hook on the things it's annoying I
mean<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.729> otherwise<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.420> fact<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> has

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the tip cuz the gel will get up further

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.060 
the tip cuz the gel will get up further
up<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> tip<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.350> I'll<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.680> cover<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
up on the tip and I'll just cover the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.069 
up on the tip and I'll just cover the
tip<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.459> they'll<00:03:17.609> be<00:03:17.790> writing<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.239> wrong<00:03:18.570> I

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
tip and they'll be writing all wrong I

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.170 
tip and they'll be writing all wrong I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
you'll be getting ink coming off places

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:23.990 
you'll be getting ink coming off places
on<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> tip<00:03:23.190> where<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.579> supposed<00:03:23.940> to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
on the tip where it's not supposed to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
on the tip where it's not supposed to
which<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.239> which<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.780> rather<00:03:24.959> disgusting<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
which is which is rather disgusting I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.620 
which is which is rather disgusting I
mean<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.549> know<00:03:26.640> I'm<00:03:26.790> writing<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.120> word<00:03:27.329> and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.440 
writing on this one it's got generally
bad<00:03:38.220> writing<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.730> mean<00:03:38.760> you're<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.150> gonna<00:03:39.269> get

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
a lot of friction between you in the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.840 
a lot of friction between you in the
paper<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:40.980> you're<00:03:41.069> gonna<00:03:41.190> be<00:03:41.310> gliding<00:03:41.579> along

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
writing so on this I mean I I don't

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.720 
writing so on this I mean I I don't
reach<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.530> mean<00:03:50.069> if<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:50.579> I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
reach for this much I mean if I if I

and I have a white piece of paper maybe

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.699 
and I have a white piece of paper maybe
I<00:03:54.600> want<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> color<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.470> know<00:03:55.560> I'd

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
probably choose this over my comm saw

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.800 
probably choose this over my comm saw
you<00:03:57.630> know<00:03:57.750> sharpie<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:59.100> it's<00:03:59.489> nice<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.150> mean

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
you know sharpie it's it's nice I mean

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.150 
you know sharpie it's it's nice I mean
it's<00:04:00.959> comfortable<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.709> probably<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
it's comfortable it's probably the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.620 
it's comfortable it's probably the
closest<00:04:02.579> thing<00:04:02.639> America<00:04:03.090> has<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
closest thing America has to the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.720 
closest thing America has to the
Japanese<00:04:04.109> doctor<00:04:04.530> grips<00:04:04.709> except<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.459> writing

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
Japanese doctor grips except the writing

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.849 
Japanese doctor grips except the writing
is<00:04:05.819> not<00:04:05.850> superb<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.540> would<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.810> would<00:04:07.109> wish<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
is not superb I would I would wish the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.800 
is not superb I would I would wish the
white<00:04:07.980> even<00:04:08.190> be<00:04:08.340> get<00:04:08.549> better<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.180> hidden<00:04:09.660> good

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
white even be get better I hidden good

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.599 
white even be get better I hidden good
the<00:04:09.959> mechanism<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.530> okay<00:04:10.829> it's<00:04:11.069> it's<00:04:11.280> it's

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
the mechanism is okay it's it's it's

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.020 
the mechanism is okay it's it's it's
decent<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.389> mean<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.280> mean<00:04:14.519> I'm<00:04:14.639> not<00:04:14.970> even

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
decent I mean the I mean I'm not even

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.340 
decent I mean the I mean I'm not even
sure<00:04:15.180> what<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> front<00:04:15.750> is<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.169> probably

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
sure what the front is it's probably

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
sure what the front is it's probably
supposed<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.799> be<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:17.039> point<00:04:17.280> 7<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:18.859> no<00:04:19.859> it's

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
supposed to be like point 7 but no it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.159 
supposed to be like point 7 but no it's
really<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:20.789> it's<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.269> dark<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.959> writes

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
really not it's it's dark and writes

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.530 
really not it's it's dark and writes
dark<00:04:22.530> it's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
dark it's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.080 
dark it's
so<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.930> mean<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:26.190> good<00:04:26.400> for<00:04:26.430> an<00:04:26.700> American

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
so I mean it's good for an American

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.030 
so I mean it's good for an American
doctor<00:04:27.300> grip<00:04:27.600> but<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> doctor<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.920> not

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
doctor grip but for a doctor it's not

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.070 
doctor grip but for a doctor it's not
the<00:04:29.280> best<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.790> would<00:04:30.330> give<00:04:30.480> this<00:04:30.600> probably<00:04:31.050> a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the best I would give this probably a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.320 
the best I would give this probably a
seven<00:04:31.440> out<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.590> ten<00:04:31.710> just<00:04:32.400> being<00:04:32.640> generous<00:04:33.060> but

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
seven out of ten just being generous but

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.630 
seven out of ten just being generous but
I<00:04:33.390> mean<00:04:33.660> otherwise<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.560> if<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.430> need<00:04:35.610> a
