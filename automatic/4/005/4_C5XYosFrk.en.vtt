00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
also hear a really strong bass in the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.130 
also hear a really strong bass in the
background<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:37.180> can<00:04:37.210> get<00:04:37.480> these<00:04:37.600> in<00:04:37.840> white

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.490 
background you can get these in white
and<00:04:38.410> black<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.450> red<00:04:40.450> also<00:04:40.750> actually<00:04:41.350> I

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
and black and red also actually I

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.110 
and black and red also actually I
believe<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.220> red<00:04:42.370> ones<00:04:42.550> are<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:42.730> little<00:04:42.910> bit

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
believe the red ones are a little bit

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.780 
believe the red ones are a little bit
more<00:04:43.150> expensive<00:04:43.930> but<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:45.250> know<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.700> get

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
more expensive but you know you can get

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.250 
more expensive but you know you can get
them<00:04:45.910> into<00:04:46.150> all<00:04:46.300> those<00:04:46.510> different<00:04:46.930> colors

them into all those different colors

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.380 
them into all those different colors
