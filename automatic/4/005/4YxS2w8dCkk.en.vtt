here<00:01:26.720> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.500> new<00:01:29.009> design<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> run<00:01:30.210> core

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
here at the new design for the run core

here at the new design for the run core
50<00:01:30.720> millimeter<00:01:31.140> you'll<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
50 millimeter you'll see that it's a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.819 
50 millimeter you'll see that it's a
double-wide<00:01:32.460> flash<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.140> actually

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
double-wide flash and this is actually

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.280 
double-wide flash and this is actually
four<00:01:38.189> times<00:01:38.220> faster<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> last<00:01:39.390> SSD<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
four times faster than the last SSD that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
four times faster than the last SSD that
run<00:01:40.439> cord<00:01:40.680> made<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> domine<00:01:41.400> 9<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
run cord made for the domine 9 so that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
run cord made for the domine 9 so that
means<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.020> gonna<00:01:43.140> load<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> programs<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
means you're gonna load the programs and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
means you're gonna load the programs and
your<00:01:44.880> OS<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.810> everything<00:01:46.770> fun<00:01:47.070> you'd<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
your OS and everything fun you'd like to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
your OS and everything fun you'd like to
do<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.850> mobile<00:01:48.090> computing<00:01:48.509> four<00:01:48.840> times

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
do with your mobile computing four times

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.470 
do with your mobile computing four times
