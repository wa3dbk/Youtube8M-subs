00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.680
 Good afternoon, I am Joseph Lazarev 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.139
 author of spiritual numerology spiritually 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.549
 numerology and thinking system using 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.210
 numbers this new year's video is somewhat 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.029
 unusual give him i decided to devote 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 meaning 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 2014 what can we expect in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 this year well in terms of spiritual 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.989
 numerology in terms of spiritual 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 den I will not go again now 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 same detailed calculations like 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.510
 how numbers interact with each other 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.039
 inside the number 2014 let's say only in common 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:53.039
 outline that this year is intended to 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.840
 stabilization for leveling relationships 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 business interstate some there 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.750
 relationship in order to establish peace 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.400
 between people to establish some kind of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 family stability and stability and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.909
 pure emotional stability in 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 purely monetary matters and so on and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.890
 it doesn't mean that this year 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 will bring you one hundred percent stability 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.939
 whether there will contribute to reconciliation 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 your reconciliation with all your 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.159
 enemies there and enemies there and so 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 further that you will no longer envy that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 you will stop jealous of someone here we are 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.549
 all we all have some weaknesses 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.290
 and everything to our weakness is pure 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 human they always leave us out 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 equilibrium states but when you will 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.380
 every time during this year go out 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.210
 out of balance you just have to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 we just have to remember that this 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 a year will only help you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 if you try 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.479
 to neutralize in itself yes not to go on about 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.190
 those feelings that do not contribute 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.520
 the world does not contribute 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.540
 pressure of some kind of equilibrium steady 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.820
 relationships and whether it is this business family 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.960
 the state doesn't matter it works on 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.070
 any level 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.930
 inside of man yes, that's very huge 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.330
 the number of people suffers in essence from 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 the fact that there is no peace first 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
 inner walk all the time with clubs with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 myself and all of them are dissatisfied with something 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.060
 within themselves they are dissatisfied with themselves or 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.890
 unhappy with what they are like them 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.900
 manifested themselves in something in this in the world as 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.120
 they have not achieved something like they are something 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.540
 not done to grief and the like then 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.160
 there is a man a huge number of people 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.970
 and met at every turn and you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:49.080
 Of course, too, a huge number of people 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 dissatisfied with themselves it all starts 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.170
 low self-esteem is all people dirt 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.900
 and if I had done so, the dacha would 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.480
 quite another thing would have happened 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.150
 much better and so on then in this 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.209
 year you need to forgive learn to forgive 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.370
 in themselves all these weaknesses all these some 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.260
 may be a failure of choice once 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.620
 have committed unimportant it already committed 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.000
 here in the past you should not bring in 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.590
 this year is a load of past problems because 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.420
 problems this is exactly what first of all 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.360
 out of balance 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.750
 and this year will help those people 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.610
 who try their best it 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.530
 equilibrium internal april total 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.890
 equilibrium you should just 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.160
 believe with yourself first and foremost 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.560
 if the world is inside you it will be 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.900
 automatically spread to your 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.370
 relationships with people and yours 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.590
 material well-being and generally on 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.550
 all the most important is the world with yourself 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.740
 This is actually and wants from us 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.200
 2014 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.780
 here's a general remember that I said 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.070
 this year must pass under the auspices of the world 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:14.680
 that is, he wants all the energy of this year 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:18.610
 directed to the lyre inside you and outside 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.030
 and how this year will be for you on 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:24.640
 will actually depend on 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.720
 how do you succeed in yourself yes 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.090
 reconcile some things drop everything then 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.220
 which leads out of balance 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.970
 which leads to such a warrior scandal 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.150
 gossip squabbles and so on especially 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.160
 vodka find envy and that depends 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.200
 from what is peculiar to us families for themselves 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.680
 often notice gives envied that 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 let it move envy that's what 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 probably one of the strongest factors 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.080
 that take a person out of state 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.610
 equilibrium so here let's try in 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.110
 2014 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.220
 eliminate all those negative 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.230
 qualities that are not all yes but those 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.610
 bright ones before that come out 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:12.310
 equilibrium states primarily anger 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.390
 hate inability to forgive 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.200
 surrounding and envy here 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.780
 perhaps the most important features in us 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.290
 give the human human psyche 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.960
 which takes us out of state 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.360
 equilibrium let's learn to live with it 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.940
 let's learn not pay attention 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.960
 on a bad accent on 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.930
 good and then this year will be 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.820
 in every way to promote riot police will be on 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.800
 your side he will play for these like 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.390
 on the football field yes he will play on 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.380
 your side he will cheer for you 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.780
 will help you he will be with you well I 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.920
 Finally, I want to wish you happiness in 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.780
 new year of peace and balance to your soul 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.780
 all the best for now
