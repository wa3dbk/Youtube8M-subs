00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
now before we get this video on the way

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.670 
now before we get this video on the way
let's<00:00:02.460> just<00:00:02.850> specify<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.720> these<00:00:03.990> specs<00:00:04.440> on

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
let's just specify that these specs on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.789 
let's just specify that these specs on
one<00:00:05.040> hundred<00:00:05.339> percent<00:00:05.370> confirm<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.870> don't

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
one hundred percent confirm so don't

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.919 
one hundred percent confirm so don't
take<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.250> all<00:00:08.460> oh<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.150> say<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.540> won't<00:00:09.690> go<00:00:09.870> as

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
six processing cause thank God you see

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.650 
six processing cause thank God you see
the<00:01:12.300> 48<00:01:12.720> 20k<00:01:13.259> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> 3820<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.700> believe<00:01:15.420> only

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the 48 20k in the 3820 I believe only

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.810 
the 48 20k in the 3820 I believe only
had<00:01:15.990> four<00:01:16.380> cores<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> eight<00:01:17.490> threads

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
had four cores and eight threads

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.480 
had four cores and eight threads
obviously<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.289> was<00:01:19.410> kind<00:01:19.679> of<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> stupid

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
obviously so it was kind of in a stupid

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
obviously so it was kind of in a stupid
position<00:01:21.030> especially<00:01:21.539> during<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> fact

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
position especially during with the fact

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
position especially during with the fact
that<00:01:23.429> you<00:01:23.580> could<00:01:23.729> easily<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.509> off<00:01:24.979> 4770k

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that you could easily just get off 4770k

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.690 
that you could easily just get off 4770k
or<00:01:26.280> 3770k<00:01:27.149> respectively<00:01:28.009> for<00:01:29.009> cheaper<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
or 3770k respectively for cheaper and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
or 3770k respectively for cheaper and
was<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.170> chamber<00:01:31.500> platform<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.310> then

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
was on the chamber platform and then

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.660 
was on the chamber platform and then
performed<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> same<00:01:33.960> regardless<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
performed about the same regardless so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
performed about the same regardless so
the<00:01:36.380> 5820<00:01:37.380> core<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.909> 3820<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> 48<00:01:39.689> 20k<00:01:40.140> at

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the 5820 core the 3820 and the 48 20k at

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.749 
the 5820 core the 3820 and the 48 20k at
the<00:01:40.439> time<00:01:40.649> was<00:01:41.100> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.460> an<00:01:41.549> awkward

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the time was kind of in an awkward

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
the time was kind of in an awkward
position<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.770> has

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
position so it's good to say this has

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
position so it's good to say this has
six<00:01:44.340> cause<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.000> does<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.689> hyper<00:01:45.930> threading

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
six cause it does have hyper threading

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.730 
six cause it does have hyper threading
50<00:01:46.799> megs<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.219> cash<00:01:47.490> uh<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> core<00:01:49.469> base

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
50 megs of cash uh it's got a core base

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
50 megs of cash uh it's got a core base
frequency<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> three<00:01:50.759> point<00:01:51.000> three<00:01:51.060> gigahertz

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
frequency of three point three gigahertz

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.770 
frequency of three point three gigahertz
and<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.890> core<00:01:53.219> minimum<00:01:53.670> frequency<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.240> 1.2

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and our core minimum frequency of 1.2

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.889 
and our core minimum frequency of 1.2
and<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.409> supports<00:01:55.860> ddr<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and it supports ddr for which is good so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.740 
and it supports ddr for which is good so
default<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> vishal<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.430> default<00:01:59.880> ddr3<00:02:00.509> our

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.550 
going to specify that and all just to
preface<00:02:17.430> or<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.450> three<00:02:18.720> CPS<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.350> going<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
preface or the three CPS I'm going to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.550 
preface or the three CPS I'm going to
talk<00:02:19.680> about<00:02:19.859> all<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> 140<00:02:21.359> watt<00:02:21.510> TDP<00:02:21.870> all

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
talk about all have a 140 watt TDP all

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.789 
talk about all have a 140 watt TDP all
the<00:02:22.859> same<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.670> next<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.239> have<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.799> 759

that's like in a perfect position well
at<00:02:32.130> least<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> case<00:02:33.209> last<00:02:33.390> year<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
at least I was the case last year and

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.380 
at least I was the case last year and
the<00:02:34.079> year<00:02:34.109> before<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.680> 249<00:02:35.130> 30k<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> the

3930k um at the time because it had six
cause<00:02:40.470> um<00:02:40.889> it<00:02:41.609> was<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.120> perfect

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
cause um it was just in a perfect

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.200 
cause um it was just in a perfect
position<00:02:42.600> was<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.560> really<00:02:44.040> good<00:02:44.220> price

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
position was that a really good price

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.850 
position was that a really good price
all<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.720> said<00:02:46.020> really<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.770> I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
all I said really good you know what I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.370 
all I said really good you know what I
made<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.460> wasn't<00:02:47.790> ridiculously<00:02:48.390> priced<00:02:49.110> like

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
made it wasn't ridiculously priced like

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.280 
made it wasn't ridiculously priced like
the<00:02:49.560> 40<00:02:49.830> 960<00:02:50.370> X<00:02:50.610> which<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.690> past<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the 40 960 X which is like like past a

the 40 960 X which is like like past a
thousand

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
thousand

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.890 
thousand
oh<00:02:54.520> but<00:02:55.520> wasn't<00:02:55.850> too<00:02:56.060> cheap<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.600> made<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
oh but wasn't too cheap that made it

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.690 
oh but wasn't too cheap that made it
look<00:02:56.930> weak<00:02:57.290> was<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:57.950> kind<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.430> six

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
look weak was that kind of that six

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.730 
look weak was that kind of that six
hundred<00:02:58.970> dollars<00:02:59.000> mark<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.960> that<00:03:00.410> made<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
hundred dollars mark and that made it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.490 
hundred dollars mark and that made it
good<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.700> had<00:03:01.910> six<00:03:02.240> course<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.840> was<00:03:03.050> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
good and I had six course that was the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.010 
good and I had six course that was the
big<00:03:03.740> dog<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.250> big<00:03:04.460> deal<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> would<00:03:05.540> assume

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
big dog the big deal so you would assume

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.190 
big dog the big deal so you would assume
that<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:07.220> Intel<00:03:07.910> planned<00:03:08.180> on<00:03:08.300> making<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.720> 58

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
that if Intel planned on making the 58

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.560 
that if Intel planned on making the 58
20k<00:03:09.740> if<00:03:10.190> they<00:03:10.400> plan<00:03:10.610> on<00:03:10.640> giving<00:03:10.790> at<00:03:11.030> six<00:03:11.270> course

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
20k if they plan on giving at six course

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.110 
20k if they plan on giving at six course
though<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.290> leads<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.620> bump<00:03:12.860> up<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.220> 59<00:03:13.610> 30k

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
though that leads to bump up the 59 30k

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.700 
though that leads to bump up the 59 30k
it's<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.270> possibility<00:03:14.600> Art's<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> possibility

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
it's a possibility Art's the possibility

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.560 
it's a possibility Art's the possibility
of<00:03:15.740> eight<00:03:16.040> well<00:03:16.880> that's<00:03:17.150> not<00:03:17.360> what<00:03:17.510> happened

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
of eight well that's not what happened

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.530 
of eight well that's not what happened
at<00:03:17.780> all<00:03:17.960> because<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.440> 59<00:03:18.830> 30k<00:03:19.370> still<00:03:20.000> has<00:03:20.240> six

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
at all because the 59 30k still has six

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.600 
at all because the 59 30k still has six
cause<00:03:20.840> yes<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.590> does<00:03:21.740> have<00:03:21.920> hyper<00:03:22.160> threading

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
cause yes it does have hyper threading

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.550 
cause yes it does have hyper threading
so<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.420> going<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.600> have<00:03:23.660> six<00:03:23.960> course<00:03:24.230> 12

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
so it's going to have six course 12

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.700 
so it's going to have six course 12
threads<00:03:24.920> just<00:03:25.250> like<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.520> deer<00:03:25.820> 20k<00:03:26.300> 15<00:03:27.290> mix<00:03:27.560> of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.700 
threads just like the deer 20k 15 mix of
cash<00:03:28.010> are<00:03:28.370> three<00:03:29.300> point<00:03:29.540> five<00:03:29.780> gigahertz<00:03:30.170> base

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.400 
cash are three point five gigahertz base

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
kind of more of the word because sure I

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.300 
kind of more of the word because sure I
reckon<00:04:50.660> 5930<00:04:51.380> case<00:04:51.680> should<00:04:51.860> i<00:04:51.950> had<00:04:52.100> eight

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
reckon 5930 case should i had eight

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.030 
reckon 5930 case should i had eight
cores<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.940> maybe<00:04:53.090> 59<00:04:53.600> 60<00:04:53.930> X<00:04:54.140> should<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.770> had<00:04:54.919> the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
cores and maybe 59 60 X should I had the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.170

core<00:04:55.280> count<00:04:55.580> bumped<00:04:56.030> up<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.450> mean<00:04:57.140> like<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:58.760> know

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
core count bumped up I mean like I know

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.670 
core count bumped up I mean like I know
what<00:04:59.510> Intel's<00:04:59.840> doing<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.200> guess<00:05:00.410> they<00:05:00.560> don't

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
what Intel's doing I guess they don't

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.219 
what Intel's doing I guess they don't
really<00:05:00.919> have<00:05:01.070> much<00:05:01.280> competition<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:02.150> AMD<00:05:03.110> at
