00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello friend and cough I'm bad bone you put this time I'll show you the curiosities 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.650
 of videogames 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.410
 so that 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.499
 we start with this new collection of curiosities 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.719
 in the secret manna of snes we have the chance to see in two locations 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.589
 of the game a mysterious effigy that corresponds to the face of Mars 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.449
 in 1976 the Viking ship one of the nasa was flying around the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.210
 Red planet to take pictures of possible places to land 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210
 of his Viking sister 2 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.950
 in one of the photos there was a face with human form in an area of ​​the planet 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.940
 known as sidonia 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.050
 the scientists were surprised at first although the mystery did not 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.560
 lasted a long time since they concluded that it was a plateau more than 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.310
 the coincidences of his training had given him an effigy of Pharaoh 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.909
 what the orkut technician 92 has in common 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.380
 the strict second hayter and the a urán 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 because the Spanish flags they show are pre-constitutional 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.790
 the two that the vital waves do not harm the strict hayter are a 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.379
 extension of your fists 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.690
 thanks to the graphic evolution of the saga 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.780
 it is becoming easier to distinguish the hands within the energy waves in 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.030
 special in the last deliveries where they are appreciated completely defined 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.840
 in one of the scenarios of lesnar that rattle in role of month is written the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.560
 word game boy 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.070
 this was the first design by gordon freeman 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.619
 protagonist of alfaix 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.780
 the sword and the scepter commit the zelda to link that water they burn share esprit 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.120
 e although with different color shades 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 wait a moment I'm running dry from so much talk 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.270
 let's keep going 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.870
 some mario bros cartridges and they will document is they do not have the seal of 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.680
 quality of nintendo 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.770
 on the cover of the cholo trigger of this month appears daily with a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 magic that does not correspond on the final screen of the month version of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 pumping man 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.770
 jackson shows the original bomberman transforming into a hand and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.780
 protagonist of another of his games he managed to poke 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.230
 a curious way to advertise your next title 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.359
 the resident evil mansion has a diskette shape 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.050
 in resident evil 3 we can read the name capcom in a coat of arms 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.819
 clouds and the thickets in the mario bros are the same but with different colors 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.380
 in the same way the mushroom bombings with eyes and legs 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.080
 the creators of the first duke nukem 1 and 2 for pc plagiaron esprit exceltur 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.610
 and sweet friend and Saturday g 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.430
 there are a lot of people who are dedicated to trying to discover Nazi symbols 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.229
 hidden in video games 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.620
 an example is the swastika shape of the stage where alex kid moves 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.890
 will join cers created by the american division of nintendo in 1994 for that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.669
 month showed a menu for the introduction of a character name 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.559
 If that name was sonic, the game showed a warning that the name was not 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.819
 It was valid because it was not enough guadi 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.469
 between gen2 zelda to link to the past we can see that the sign that 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.309
 decorates one of the houses looks like a popular photo it point yeltes of the 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.829
 website makes 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.659
 another reference to what it does and perhaps more clearly than the previous one is what we can 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.639
 find in bioshock in the mega man 2 before facing cashman we can 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.250
 take a break observing the constellation of the greater bear 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.030
 in the assassin's creed we came across a wooden furniture very similar to 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.930
 optimal for ing 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.569
 protagonist of transformers this prototype of lan is that he does not have to 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 envy nothing to the current design of the next generation consoles 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.329
 the first strict vote hayter in the arcade salons in 1987 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.359
 two years later capcom prepared a sequel whose provisional title was 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.999
 strictly 89 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.319
 but finally he dissociated himself from the saga of ryu and changed his name 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.929
 for the final fight 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.689
 in Don Kelly with out between two fields we found a direct attack on 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.539
 competition it is worth remembering that at that time the law was a kind of 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:48.610
 affiliate of nintendo 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.419
 and therefore 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.270
 his enemies were the same 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.530
 At the end of the game we compared our score of coins collected with 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.980
 the one of three famous nintendo mario characters I know and link 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.780
 while on the right of the screen we could see the sonic boots and the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.250
 artur mas gun who next to a garbage can and a sign that showed 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.140
 the message of no other 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.009
 not the losers 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.959
 the name of the protagonist of the monkey island series comes from the software that 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.199
 it was used to paint and animate the 'deluxe' pent 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.680
 in the absence of a better man the file was saved as gucci 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.460
 type and the extension that added the erasmus program and therefore the file 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.460
 it was like a bonus point 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.040
 his last name threepwood was the name of a rpg character detave grossman one 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.999
 of the programmers and was elected by vote 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.809
 at first the characters of nintendo were going to star in the wii 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.650
 sports but in the end they replaced me 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.629
 the final seventh fantasy was going to come out originally for the nintendo 64 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.040
 were the differences between school and the nintendo itself that 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.740
 would determine their output on playstation 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 between gen2 zelda ocarina of time and when link is found for the first time 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.180
 with the princess we can see three curious portraits through a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.349
 window of the castle of hyrule 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.449
 well this is all friends I will not do a next installment of the curiosities 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.620
 since I did not find more I'm sorry 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.520
 If you ask me about the video of the Americanization of videogames 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.319
 quiet 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.369
 there will be soon this video I dedicate it to my fried choir yack 

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:20.740
 although sometimes it can be a bastard is a very good person 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.029
 or so I think 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.289
 I am Maria bone you greetings
