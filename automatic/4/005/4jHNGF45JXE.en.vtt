responsive not the best Cruiser for
pushing<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.350> town<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> pretty

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
pushing around town because it is pretty

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
pushing around town because it is pretty

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's gonna be plenty stable because it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
it's gonna be plenty stable because it's
got<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> nine<00:00:47.489> ply<00:00:47.789> construction<00:00:47.850> they're

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
got a nine ply construction they're

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.180 
got a nine ply construction they're
gonna<00:00:49.320> keep<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> nice<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.829> stiff<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> stable

gonna keep you nice and stiff and stable

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
gonna keep you nice and stiff and stable
but<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.699> coolest<00:00:54.449> thing<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.020> board<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
but the coolest thing about this board I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160 
but the coolest thing about this board I
think<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.820> concave<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
think is the concave that's going on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
think is the concave that's going on
right<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.430> you're<00:00:59.579> familiar<00:00:59.789> with

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
right here now if you're familiar with

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.709 
right here now if you're familiar with
the<00:01:00.780> sector<00:01:01.500> nine<00:01:01.680> Daisy<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the sector nine Daisy that is now the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.460 
the sector nine Daisy that is now the
Aero<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.480> basically<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.780> old<00:01:06.960> Daisy

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
Aero this is basically the old Daisy

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.270 
Aero this is basically the old Daisy
mold<00:01:07.980> so<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.910> pretty<00:01:09.270> mellow<00:01:09.840> rocker<00:01:10.650> drop

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
mold so it's a pretty mellow rocker drop

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.430 
mold so it's a pretty mellow rocker drop
but<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.570> enough<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.410> a

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
but it's got just enough of like a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340 
but it's got just enough of like a
rounded<00:01:14.100> spoon<00:01:14.400> shape<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.960> really

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
rounded spoon shape in there to really

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
rounded spoon shape in there to really
give<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> something<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> wedge<00:01:17.550> your<00:01:17.580> feet

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
give you something to wedge your feet

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
give you something to wedge your feet
into<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.470> too<00:01:19.740> extreme<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> it's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
into but it's not too extreme that it's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
into but it's not too extreme that it's
gonna<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.940> push<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.510> foot<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.900> feel

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
gonna like push in your foot and feel

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.900 
gonna like push in your foot and feel
funny<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.800> huge<00:01:23.100> fan<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.580> mold<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
funny I'm a huge fan of this mold and

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.290 
funny I'm a huge fan of this mold and
I've<00:01:24.060> spent<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.540> time<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.050> it<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:27.030> does

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
I've spent a lot of time on it it does

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.970 
I've spent a lot of time on it it does
one<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.660> main<00:01:27.780> differences<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.800> this

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
one of the main differences from this

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.310 
one of the main differences from this
and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> Daisy<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.060> where<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.660> trucks<00:01:31.080> are

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and the Daisy is where the trucks are

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.970 
and the Daisy is where the trucks are
mounted<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.990> old<00:01:34.110> Daisy<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.740> trucks

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
mounted so on the old Daisy the trucks

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.560 
mounted so on the old Daisy the trucks
would<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> mounted<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.910> here<00:01:36.300> would<00:01:36.450> be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
would be mounted about here would be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
would be mounted about here would be
your<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.900> truck<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.070> mounted

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your back truck but these are mounted

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
your back truck but these are mounted
and<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.030> farther<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> little

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and a little farther so it is a little

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.830 
and a little farther so it is a little
bit<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.250> drop<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.450> gonna<00:01:42.540> give<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bit on that drop so it's gonna give the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.480 
bit on that drop so it's gonna give the
trucks<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.620> more<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> wedge<00:01:44.160> make

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
trucks a little more of a wedge make

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
trucks a little more of a wedge make
them<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.910> more<00:01:45.060> responsive<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
them a little more responsive in the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.700 
them a little more responsive in the
front<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.300> gets<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.750> foot<00:01:49.170> closer

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
front but it also gets your foot closer

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.320 
front but it also gets your foot closer
to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> trucks<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.300> that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
to the trucks when they're right in that

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.850 
to the trucks when they're right in that
rockered<00:01:51.900> pocket<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.470> talking<00:01:52.800> about

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
rockered pocket I was talking about

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.220 
rockered pocket I was talking about
