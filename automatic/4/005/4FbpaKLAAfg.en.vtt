European I believe it's Australian
American<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.840> British<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.890> believe<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
American and British I believe that is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.969 
American and British I believe that is
they're<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.729> hunting<00:01:45.000> us<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.420> sure<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.720> my

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
they're not hunting us into sure all my

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.960 
they're not hunting us into sure all my
things<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.189> how<00:01:47.310> they've<00:01:47.430> changed<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
things but how they've changed it's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.429 
things but how they've changed it's
basically<00:01:48.240> kick<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> side<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
basically kick about in the side and it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.830 
basically kick about in the side and it
pops<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> match<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pops out and you got a match up the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.649 
pops out and you got a match up the
lines<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> other<00:01:52.649> side<00:01:52.890> which<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lines on the other side which was you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
lines on the other side which was you
know<00:01:54.780> rather<00:01:54.960> easy<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.770> once<00:01:56.640> at

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
know rather easy as you can see once at

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
know rather easy as you can see once at
the<00:01:56.880> scene<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.229> other<00:01:58.259> end

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the scene you do have the other end

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.899 
the scene you do have the other end
which<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.799> obviously<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.310> charge<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
which you obviously will charge the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
which you obviously will charge the
power<00:02:00.149> brick<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:00.869> bring<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> power<00:02:01.530> brick

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
power brick now bring in the power brick

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
power brick now bring in the power brick
you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> traveling<00:02:03.119> case

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you can see it's got the traveling case

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.330 
you can see it's got the traveling case
which<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:03.960> nice<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.740> let<00:02:04.979> me<00:02:05.070> tell<00:02:05.280> you

which is really nice now let me tell you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.240 
which is really nice now let me tell you
this<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.479> shockproof

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
this now this has a shockproof

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.850 
this now this has a shockproof
shockproof<00:02:08.250> waterproof<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.440> means<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
shockproof waterproof you know means it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280 
shockproof waterproof you know means it
is<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.400> full<00:02:11.910> whack<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.780> basically<00:02:13.050> this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
is the full whack so basically this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.700 
is the full whack so basically this
cancer

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
cancer

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
cancer
five<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.610> extremist<00:02:15.210> edition<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> can

five the extremist edition so you can
see<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.710> power<00:02:16.920> brick<00:02:17.160> itself

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
see here this is the power brick itself

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.940 
see here this is the power brick itself
is<00:02:18.150> rather<00:02:18.480> heavy<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.620> me<00:02:19.770> heavy

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
is rather heavy but it's not me heavy

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.470 
is rather heavy but it's not me heavy
enough<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.970> feel<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> your

big<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> discovered<00:02:51.270> when<00:02:51.390> that's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
big now what I discovered when that's

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.330 
big now what I discovered when that's
young<00:02:51.840> box<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.980> green

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
young box in this is that the green

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.150 
young box in this is that the green
light<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.240> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> right

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
light which you can see on the right

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.400 
light which you can see on the right
goes<00:02:56.160> strong<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> has<00:02:57.300> strong<00:02:57.690> UV<00:02:58.170> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
goes strong when it has strong UV and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.620 
goes strong when it has strong UV and
goes<00:02:58.650> dark<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.400> poor<00:02:59.700> UV<00:03:00.150> now

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
goes dark when you have poor UV now

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.960 
goes dark when you have poor UV now
there<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.900> due<00:03:01.020> USB<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.070> day<00:03:02.910> to

like<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.270> here<00:03:06.450> there<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.690> two<00:03:06.810> solar

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
like you see here there are two solar

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.190 
like you see here there are two solar
panels<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.650> get<00:03:07.830> some<00:03:07.980> good<00:03:08.220> strong

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
panels so you get some good strong

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.710 
panels so you get some good strong
connection<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.800> some<00:03:10.980> good<00:03:11.250> power<00:03:11.720> so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
connection so you get some good power so

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
connection so you get some good power so
yeah<00:03:12.870> that's<00:03:13.050> basically<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.710> actual<00:03:14.220> power

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
yeah that's basically the actual power

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.430 
yeah that's basically the actual power
