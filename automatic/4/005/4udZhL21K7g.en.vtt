00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.170 
three good reasons why i love this black
rapid<00:03:01.470> strap<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.280> first<00:03:02.549> thing<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
rapid strap the first thing is that the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
rapid strap the first thing is that the
weight<00:03:03.330> distribution<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:04.080> terrific<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
weight distribution is terrific you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.350 
weight distribution is terrific you
carry<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.950> over<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.220> shoulder<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.150> when

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
carry it over your shoulder so that when

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.960 
carry it over your shoulder so that when
you<00:03:06.450> pick<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.620> very<00:03:07.860> nice<00:03:08.310> easy<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
you pick it up it's very nice easy and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.880 
you pick it up it's very nice easy and
you're<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.900> carrying<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.620> shoulder

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
you're not carrying it on this shoulder

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
you're not carrying it on this shoulder
so<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.610> really<00:03:11.640> distributes<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> weight<00:03:12.569> and
