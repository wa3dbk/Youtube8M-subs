00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
about ten years older than him and he

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.889

would be a really good addition to the
Arsenal<00:01:52.229> team<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.040> surely<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.579> second

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
Arsenal team so surely in that second

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.280
