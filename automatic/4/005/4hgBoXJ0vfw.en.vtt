funny way is a bigger test isn't it

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.399

because<00:00:26.509> they've<00:00:26.659> gotta<00:00:26.869> beat<00:00:27.079> things<00:00:27.289> like

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
well yeah I mean this is that I think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.390 
well yeah I mean this is that I think
the<00:00:29.150> next<00:00:29.359> six<00:00:29.539> or<00:00:29.659> seven<00:00:29.960> games<00:00:30.199> there<00:00:30.560> these

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
the next six or seven games there these

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.679 
the next six or seven games there these
are<00:00:31.550> very<00:00:31.730> prevalent<00:00:31.970> these<00:00:32.270> type<00:00:32.509> of<00:00:32.540> games

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
are very prevalent these type of games

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.950 
are very prevalent these type of games
and<00:00:33.110> unfortunately<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.070> mayor<00:00:34.220> city<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:34.670> far

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
and unfortunately for mayor city so far

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.630 
and unfortunately for mayor city so far
these<00:00:35.960> are<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.140> ones<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.380> have<00:00:36.560> proved<00:00:37.520> to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
these are the ones that have proved to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.580 
these are the ones that have proved to
be<00:00:37.760> their<00:00:37.880> downfall<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.020> see<00:00:39.200> them<00:00:39.380> do

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
be their downfall so do you see them do

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.750 
be their downfall so do you see them do
you<00:00:39.650> see<00:00:39.710> them<00:00:39.800> pushing<00:00:40.100> on<00:00:40.310> having<00:00:40.580> beaten

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
you see them pushing on having beaten

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.030 
you see them pushing on having beaten
Chelsea<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:41.870> don't<00:00:42.170> need<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.680> make<00:00:42.860> that

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
Chelsea and I don't need to make that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.740 
Chelsea and I don't need to make that
much<00:00:43.280> difference<00:00:43.310> I<00:00:43.850> think<00:00:43.880> that<00:00:44.210> ultimately

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
much difference I think that ultimately

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.630 
much difference I think that ultimately
we<00:00:45.320> could<00:00:45.740> you<00:00:45.890> know<00:00:45.950> they<00:00:46.130> are<00:00:46.310> one<00:00:46.490> of<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
we could you know they are one of the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.920 
we could you know they are one of the
sides<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:47.000> could<00:00:47.150> beat<00:00:47.300> us<00:00:47.540> there<00:00:47.720> aren't

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
sides that could beat us there aren't

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.360 
sides that could beat us there aren't
very<00:00:47.960> many<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.650> Premiership<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.220> their

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
very many in the Premiership on their

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.430 
very many in the Premiership on their
day<00:00:49.550> they<00:00:50.060> play<00:00:50.270> well<00:00:50.450> and<00:00:50.690> Chelsea<00:00:51.050> play<00:00:51.230> well

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
day they play well and Chelsea play well

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.110 
day they play well and Chelsea play well
maybe<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.980> want<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.280> decide<00:00:52.490> to<00:00:52.640> can<00:00:52.820> beat<00:00:52.970> them

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
maybe I want to decide to can beat them

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.040 
maybe I want to decide to can beat them
but<00:00:54.110> then<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:55.010> know<00:00:55.100> how<00:00:55.660> defensively<00:00:56.660> set<00:00:56.960> up

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
but then you know how defensively set up

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.280 
but then you know how defensively set up
or<00:00:57.260> will<00:00:57.560> they<00:00:57.680> be<00:00:58.600> what<00:00:59.600> sort<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> balance

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
or will they be what sort of balance

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.900 
or will they be what sort of balance
will<00:01:00.470> they<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.770> gone<00:01:00.980> into<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:01.370> game<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
will they have gone into this game so

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.880 
will they have gone into this game so
and<00:01:02.360> we've<00:01:02.510> Bolton<00:01:02.840> of<00:01:02.960> bottner<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.590> real

different<00:01:35.390> directions<00:01:36.880> that's<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.030> recipe<00:01:38.180> for

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
different directions that's a recipe for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.300 
different directions that's a recipe for
disaster<00:01:38.600> you'd<00:01:39.440> think<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.740> game<00:01:39.950> against<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
disaster you'd think a game against the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.740 
disaster you'd think a game against the
team<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.580> city<00:01:40.790> would<00:01:40.970> maybe<00:01:41.120> bring<00:01:41.450> people

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
team I city would maybe bring people

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.270 
team I city would maybe bring people
together<00:01:41.900> but<00:01:42.260> if<00:01:42.380> you're<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.680> if<00:01:42.920> you're<00:01:43.130> in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
together but if you're in if you're in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.410 
together but if you're in if you're in
trouble<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.670> dressing<00:01:44.030> room<00:01:44.150> oh<00:01:44.240> yeah<00:01:44.390> I

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
trouble in the dressing room oh yeah I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.820

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
think this will tell us an awful lot

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.530 
think this will tell us an awful lot
about<00:01:45.950> not<00:01:46.280> just<00:01:46.430> minh<00:01:46.580> city<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.000> Bob<00:01:47.150> moon<00:01:47.420> it

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
about not just minh city but Bob moon it

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.090 
about not just minh city but Bob moon it
because<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.170> will<00:01:48.380> find<00:01:48.620> out<00:01:48.740> exactly<00:01:48.979> where

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
because we will find out exactly where

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
because we will find out exactly where
bolt<00:01:49.370> now<00:01:49.520> because<00:01:49.940> if<00:01:50.479> they're<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:50.810> together

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
bolt now because if they're not together

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.539 
bolt now because if they're not together
then<00:01:51.560> they're<00:01:51.770> going<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.950> get<00:01:52.040> beaten<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.430> this
