00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.880 
the combo you'll notice a Down punch
followed<00:02:51.299> by<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.590> missile<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.209> hit<00:02:55.310> I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
followed by a missile if you just hit I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.610 
followed by a missile if you just hit I
down<00:02:58.890> attack<00:02:59.519> one<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> back<00:03:00.720> attack<00:03:01.320> three

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
down attack one and back attack three

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.009 
down attack one and back attack three
he'll<00:03:02.070> do<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.250> mood<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
he'll do the mood but you have to do it

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.550 
he'll do the mood but you have to do it
fast<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> looks<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:08.299> down<00:03:09.299> punch<00:03:09.660> or

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
fast so it looks like that down punch or

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.729 
fast so it looks like that down punch or
down<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.459> back<00:03:11.700> three<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:13.470> gotta<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.709> it

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
down one back three just gotta do it

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.000 
down one back three just gotta do it
real<00:03:13.890> fast<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.829> pro

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
real fast and then you can put the pro

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.270 
real fast and then you can put the pro
move<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.960 

so<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.680> rest<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> combo<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.790> just

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
so the rest of the combo is just

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.110 
so the rest of the combo is just
learning<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.360> timing<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.020> popups<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
learning the timing of the popups and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:47.690 
learning the timing of the popups and
trying<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.180> get<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.390> timing<00:03:30.600> down<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.700> that's

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
trying to get the timing down and that's

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.699 
trying to get the timing down and that's
his<00:03:47.910> combo<00:03:48.239> challenge<00:03:48.630> really<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.530> pretty

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
his combo challenge really it's pretty

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.640 
his combo challenge really it's pretty
easy<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:50.880> too<00:03:51.060> difficult<00:03:51.239> for<00:03:51.750> number<00:03:52.500> ten

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
easy not too difficult for number ten

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.060 
easy not too difficult for number ten
just<00:03:52.980> learning<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:54.180> timing<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:55.070> really

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
just learning the the timing I really

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.259 
just learning the the timing I really
can't<00:03:56.100> say<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> timing<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.209> don't

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
can't say what the timing is I don't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.890 
can't say what the timing is I don't
know<00:03:57.420> how<00:03:57.540> many<00:03:57.690> frames<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.400> between<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
know how many frames it is between the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.199 
know how many frames it is between the
stun<00:04:00.900> probably<00:04:01.709> by<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.860> pop-up<00:04:02.310> followed<00:04:03.090> by

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
stun probably by the pop-up followed by

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.120 
stun probably by the pop-up followed by
the<00:04:03.269> kick<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> matter<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
the kick it's just all a matter of

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.240 
the kick it's just all a matter of
learning<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.550> timing<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.980> then<00:04:07.980> once<00:04:08.160> you

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
learning the timing and then once you

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.979 
learning the timing and then once you
get<00:04:08.430> comfortable<00:04:08.459> with<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.630> tie<00:04:09.840> in

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
get comfortable with that you can tie in

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.449 
get comfortable with that you can tie in
the<00:04:10.260> end<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.400> combo<00:04:13.459> looks<00:04:14.459> like<00:04:14.610> that

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
the end of the combo looks like that

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.000 
the end of the combo looks like that
hope<00:04:17.459> this<00:04:17.609> helps<00:04:17.669> guys
