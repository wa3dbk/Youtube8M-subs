here and activate a loading zone
recommend<00:02:28.730> sliding<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.360> helps<00:02:29.630> me<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.900> least

kind of slide under the loading zone

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.780 
kind of slide under the loading zone
there's<00:02:32.900> anything<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.890> yeah<00:02:34.040> once<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.400> do

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
hit a loading zone you'll you know just

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.819 
hit a loading zone you'll you know just
Peter<00:02:36.769> right<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.250> Jovian<00:02:37.489> complex<00:02:38.239> and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
Peter right up in the Jovian complex and

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.819 
Peter right up in the Jovian complex and
just<00:02:39.829> another<00:02:40.069> tip<00:02:40.310> guys<00:02:40.549> uh<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.480> was<00:02:42.260> saying<00:02:42.560> if

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
just another tip guys uh I was saying if

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.250 
just another tip guys uh I was saying if
you<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:43.790> go<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.450> loading<00:02:44.780> zone<00:02:44.989> and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
you just go to that loading zone and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.780 
you just go to that loading zone and
you're<00:02:45.349> not<00:02:45.440> close<00:02:45.829> enough<00:02:46.129> you<00:02:46.340> might<00:02:46.489> spawn

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
you're not close enough you might spawn

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660 
you're not close enough you might spawn
outside<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.299> map<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.750> Jovian<00:02:48.049> complex<00:02:48.860> so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
outside the map in the Jovian complex so

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.789 
outside the map in the Jovian complex so
if<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.120> happens<00:02:50.599> just<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.170> back<00:02:51.410> where<00:02:51.709> you

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
if that happens just go back where you

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.850 
if that happens just go back where you
got<00:02:52.030> out<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.360> map<00:02:53.569> go<00:02:53.930> exactly<00:02:54.349> where<00:02:54.769> you

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
got out of the map go exactly where you

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.710 
got out of the map go exactly where you
got<00:02:55.040> out<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.310> map<00:02:55.519> it's<00:02:56.360> up<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.690> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
got out of the map it's up to you to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.410 
got out of the map it's up to you to
find<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.349> not<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.500> hard<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.420> then

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
find it it's not that hard and then

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.879 
find it it's not that hard and then
you'll<00:02:59.569> hit<00:02:59.690> another<00:02:59.930> loading<00:03:00.290> zone<00:03:00.470> back<00:03:00.709> to

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
you'll hit another loading zone back to

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.039 
you'll hit another loading zone back to
Skywatch<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.090> come<00:03:02.569> back<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.930> this

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
Skywatch and then come back to this

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.870 
Skywatch and then come back to this
loading<00:03:03.470> zone<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.340> once<00:03:04.579> you're<00:03:04.730> inside

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
loading zone but once you're inside

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.550 
loading zone but once you're inside
you're<00:03:05.150> inside<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.410> simple

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
you're inside it's a simple

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.160 
you're inside it's a simple
and<00:03:08.800> let's<00:03:09.610> see<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.300> it's<00:03:10.630> pretty<00:03:10.930> cool

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and let's see you know it's pretty cool

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.410 
and let's see you know it's pretty cool
in<00:03:11.349> here<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.940> there's<00:03:12.940> supposed<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.239> be<00:03:13.300> a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
in here like there's supposed to be a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.820 
in here like there's supposed to be a
lot<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.660> enemies<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.200> here<00:03:14.470> because<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.770> is

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
lot of enemies in here because this is

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.790 
lot of enemies in here because this is
actually<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> strike<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.989> don't<00:03:17.319> expect<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
actually a strike so don't expect it to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.280 
actually a strike so don't expect it to
be<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:17.920> empty<00:03:18.310> when<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.849> dlc<00:03:19.360> comes<00:03:19.599> out<00:03:19.810> early

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
be so empty when the dlc comes out early

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.000 
be so empty when the dlc comes out early
on<00:03:20.470> disk<00:03:20.980> expansion<00:03:21.910> comes<00:03:22.360> out<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.890> it's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
on disk expansion comes out but it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.940 
on disk expansion comes out but it's
pretty<00:03:27.190> cool<00:03:27.459> i<00:03:27.519> mean<00:03:27.849> this<00:03:28.300> is<00:03:28.360> this<00:03:28.650> has<00:03:29.650> been

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
pretty cool i mean this is this has been

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.740 
pretty cool i mean this is this has been
found<00:03:30.190> like<00:03:30.519> probably<00:03:30.790> since<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.269> beta<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
found like probably since the beta and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.630 
found like probably since the beta and
all<00:03:31.840> honesty<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.890> never<00:03:33.010> made<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> video

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
all honesty I just never made it video

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880 
all honesty I just never made it video
of<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.030> then<00:03:34.599> I<00:03:34.630> roster<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.680> wasn't

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
of this and then I roster this wasn't

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.830 
of this and then I roster this wasn't
that<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.340> know<00:03:36.489> well<00:03:36.670> known<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.269> figured<00:03:37.720> it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
that you know well known so I figured it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.479 
that you know well known so I figured it
was<00:03:37.930> still<00:03:38.140> worth<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.560> especially<00:03:38.769> since<00:03:39.340> I've

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
was still worth it especially since I've

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.780 
was still worth it especially since I've
just<00:03:39.610> made<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.849> video<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:41.380> me<00:03:41.620> inside<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.370> in

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
just made a video of me inside this in

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.850 
just made a video of me inside this in
my<00:03:42.910> previous<00:03:43.269> video<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.019> didn't<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.739> an

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
my previous video and didn't have an

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.620 
my previous video and didn't have an
