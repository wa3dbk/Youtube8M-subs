00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.759
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.920
 lemonade and today we'll talk about 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.199
 protecting iphone many of you with it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 buying want it to become with the same 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 brilliant and nicotine for a long time of course 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.689
 does this help us covers and today I 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 tell you about the most basic types 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.840
 covers and so let's get started 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.050
 unpretentious this is a case of the form of a bumper 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.489
 there is a simple such a frame itself started this 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.309
 the bumper was coined by a spider company when 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.430
 the most starting principles at the very beginning 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 sales of iphone 4 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 what a frame 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 about clutching a full palm with people here 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.789
 and the network disappeared 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.539
 and the bumper solved that situation but in the end he 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.539
 turned into a standalone accessory 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.579
 and so you can say he doesn't 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.659
 this is certainly not the most standard but all 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.119
 but everything is closed only here is the frame 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 can be said and nothing is protected but 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 You can almost film that is film 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.610
 front film behind 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 they will help you and the phone especially 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.650
 will not develop so this means 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.729
 the case costs about 300 to 1000 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.650
 rubles see what you want more abruptly with 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.420
 two lined with one lining 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 such a company is the second case 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:46.590
 such a male cardboard garbage that is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.439
 this is such a bumper and rear and side then 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.790
 what's the law closes the cover here here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.610
 traced the apple will wear that is 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.409
 see on white he is very beautiful one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.810
 the whole whole apple glistens but he 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:10.770
 does not protect against any 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.960
 so to speak beating this phone 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.580
 deformation that is, he can here 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:24.700
 see that is he on hand in the corner is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:28.720
 his case is worth 700 and a half 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.450
 thousand depending on its quality here 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.660
 the same quality plastic already 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:41.680
 which does not bend at all angry birds 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.990
 It costs 1200 rubles, which is now the company 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.780
 you do and in general he of course 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:54.040
 cool now him go he tight 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.980
 fit strong I dropped you now 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.590
 say with a belt on the tile floor like this 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.310
 so he fell with him nothing happened and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.990
 science themselves scratching everything cool case 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.070
 so advise everyone mercedes film 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.660
 therefore generally super means let's 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.490
 now we will see it completely 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:19.420
 cover covers means first case 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.980
 this is such a leather sarcophagus can 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.730
 say that with such a ribbon with 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.440
 the elevator slips iphone can 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.680
 he is already very old therefore not 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.680
 give me a hard time shoving our iphone here 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.120
 here that is he is not fully then because 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.970
 that he hasn't developed yet but he just 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.050
 not from iphone and here with the help of elevator here 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.280
 This he gets out and quietly enough on 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.040
 my is not very convenient but it costs from 500 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.110
 up to 2,000 rubles, that is , depending 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.470
 what material do you want size and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.820
 build quality here is another 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.050
 The last but one case is our collection. 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:14.020
 totally enclosed case with bumper 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:17.250
 sides of leatherette so very cool 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:22.180
 2000 rubles is pleasant to the touch 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.410
 iphone rises here very well that is 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.220
 here 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.610

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.800
 then there may certainly here and so Mitzi 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.630
 but front and rear glass that is he 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.300
 protects perfectly but not convenient to charge 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.940
 the phone is like that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.250
 choose not very convenient ie dock 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.910
 the station is not thrown so here and the last 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.050
 case for one of the most interesting is 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.290
 here are two to one and a half to three thousand as well 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:01.630

 this case is charging now he is not 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.860
 charging because there is no charge on 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.080
 battery but the sun is so fat 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.000

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.770
 connector by the way cool thing 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.270
 if you talk a lot by phone 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.490
 you can always charge you 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.560

 be so arrogantly nothing broke you 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.970
 pocket but the choice is generally generally stand behind 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.580
 that is, you like that, that is 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.230

 security more security but 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:22.360
 great price or something average 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.650
