doesn't<00:02:50.450> mean<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.660> say<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.140> ever<00:02:51.380> slow

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
doesn't mean to say that it's ever slow

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.740 
doesn't mean to say that it's ever slow
because<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.459> there's<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.880> tension<00:02:53.180> which

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
because it's not there's a tension which

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.410 
because it's not there's a tension which
is<00:02:53.900> very<00:02:54.200> very<00:02:54.350> carefully<00:02:54.920> managed<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.610> there

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
is very very carefully managed and there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990 
is very very carefully managed and there
are<00:02:56.510> many<00:02:56.570> examples<00:02:57.140> where<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.920> shot<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.760> held

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
are many examples where a shot is held

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240 
are many examples where a shot is held
long<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.989> believe<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.860> gives<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
long and I believe it just gives the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.400 
long and I believe it just gives the
audience<00:03:01.340> time<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.940> really<00:03:02.239> feel<00:03:02.630> things<00:03:03.080> I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
audience time to really feel things I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.220 
audience time to really feel things I
think<00:03:03.830> shooting<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.180> pointing<00:03:06.080> out

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
think shooting it that way pointing out

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.910 
think shooting it that way pointing out
the<00:03:06.470> complicity<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.850> people<00:03:08.650> around<00:03:09.650> the
