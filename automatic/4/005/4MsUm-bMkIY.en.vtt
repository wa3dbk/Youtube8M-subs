seasons<00:00:38.670> they're<00:00:39.239> laying<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
seasons they're laying in here and it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010

a<00:00:40.920> very<00:00:41.160> healthy<00:00:41.460> soil<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.270> because

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a very healthy soil actually because

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
a very healthy soil actually because
we're<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:43.980> disturbing<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> earthworms

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we're not disturbing the earthworms

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940

we're<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.570> disturbing<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> things<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we're not disturbing a lot of things and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
we're not disturbing a lot of things and
there's<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> aeration<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.390> through

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
there's a lot of aeration going through

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.760 
there's a lot of aeration going through
the<00:00:48.809> system<00:00:50.090> from<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> top<00:00:51.270> down<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.559> even

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the system from the top down so even

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
the system from the top down so even
when<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.070> rains<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:54.030> much<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> sponge

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
when it rains it's much like a sponge

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
when it rains it's much like a sponge
and<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> takes<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> waters<00:00:55.920> down<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and it takes the waters down into the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
and it takes the waters down into the
root<00:00:56.699> system<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.870> easy<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> walk

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
root system and it's very easy to walk

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
root system and it's very easy to walk
on<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> work<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.969> at<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.480> times<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.960> the

year even in the wintertime when it's
raining<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> times<00:01:03.510> we'll<00:01:03.719> come<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
raining a lot of times we'll come out to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
raining a lot of times we'll come out to
dinners<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.920> prune<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> grass

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
dinners in prune where we have the grass

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
dinners in prune where we have the grass
culture<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.710> solid<00:01:08.159> floor

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
culture because it's a very solid floor

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060 
culture because it's a very solid floor
unlike<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> cultivated<00:01:09.659> floor<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.830> could

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
unlike a cultivated floor that could

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
unlike a cultivated floor that could
have<00:01:11.280> six<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.670> eight<00:01:11.729> inches<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.150> give<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have six or eight inches to give and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
have six or eight inches to give and
lots<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> mud<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.650> boots<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
lots of mud on your boots so this is a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.859 
lots of mud on your boots so this is a
very<00:01:15.240> forgiving<00:01:15.930> floor<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.729> work<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.360> all

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
deviate it in other words try to limit

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.639 
deviate it in other words try to limit
its<00:01:46.890> growth<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> its<00:01:47.670> capabilities<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.930> well

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
its growth and its capabilities as well

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
its growth and its capabilities as well
as<00:01:49.740> its<00:01:49.860> capacity<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.759> set<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> moderately

as its capacity and set a moderately
good<00:01:51.960> crop<00:01:53.149> we<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.360> add<00:01:54.740> anything<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
good crop we don't add anything to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.539 
good crop we don't add anything to
increase<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> crop<00:01:57.600> load<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.369> much

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
increase the crop load it's pretty much

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.649 
increase the crop load it's pretty much
what<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.210> year<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> year<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.659> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
what we see year in and year out so this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.219 
what we see year in and year out so this
is<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> roughly<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.820> third<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.060> pound<00:02:06.229> cluster

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
is a roughly a third of a pound cluster

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
third of a pound you can see they're

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.949 
third of a pound you can see they're
pretty<00:02:10.170> condensed<00:02:10.830> tightly<00:02:11.819> packed<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.450> here

I only sprayed in this vineyard for

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.770 
I only sprayed in this vineyard for
mildew<00:02:58.739> prevention<00:02:59.609> five<00:02:59.940> times<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.510> year

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
mildew prevention five times this year

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.500

and<00:03:00.840> included<00:03:01.799> bunch<00:03:02.459> rot<00:03:02.730> preventative

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and included bunch rot preventative

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
and included bunch rot preventative
materials<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.319> well<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.489> means<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
materials as well and that means that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
materials as well and that means that
we're<00:03:06.150> trying<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> minimize<00:03:07.109> any<00:03:07.560> mildew<00:03:08.099> or

have no mildew and keep the bunch rot

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.599 
have no mildew and keep the bunch rot
from<00:03:10.680> starting<00:03:11.609> within<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> clusters<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.609> so

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
from starting within the clusters and so

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.000 
from starting within the clusters and so
again<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.420> very<00:03:15.629> clean<00:03:15.959> program<00:03:16.560> very
