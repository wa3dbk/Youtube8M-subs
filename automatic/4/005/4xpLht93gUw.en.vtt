00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:04.590 
you're next when we put the memory on

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.370 
you're next when we put the memory on
see<00:00:05.590> we've<00:00:05.740> got<00:00:05.890> four<00:00:06.160> memory<00:00:06.430> slots<00:00:06.580> here

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
anyway enough about that go ahead take

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.660 
anyway enough about that go ahead take
the<00:00:40.300> memory<00:00:40.600> out<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.870> packaging<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
the memory out of the packaging and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.930 
the memory out of the packaging and
install<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.600> into<00:00:43.839> these<00:00:44.170> slots<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:45.789> don't

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
install it into these slots and I don't

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.229 
install it into these slots and I don't
know<00:00:46.000> if<00:00:46.059> you<00:00:46.120> saw<00:00:46.300> make<00:00:46.629> sure<00:00:46.780> these<00:00:46.899> are<00:00:47.079> open

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
know if you saw make sure these are open

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.220 
know if you saw make sure these are open
the<00:00:49.239> memory<00:00:49.570> will<00:00:49.749> only<00:00:49.929> go<00:00:50.260> one<00:00:50.769> way<00:00:51.839> if<00:00:52.839> you

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
the memory will only go one way if you

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.729 
the memory will only go one way if you
notice<00:00:53.530> if<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.399> put<00:00:54.609> it<00:00:54.699> upside<00:00:54.999> down<00:00:55.589> there<00:00:56.589> is

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
notice if I put it upside down there is

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.369 
notice if I put it upside down there is
a<00:00:56.769> notch<00:00:57.399> here<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.030> an<00:00:58.359> onsen<00:00:58.749> memory<00:00:59.140> will

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
a notch here and an onsen memory will

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.459 
a notch here and an onsen memory will
not<00:00:59.589> line<00:00:59.829> up<00:00:59.859> so<00:01:00.850> go<00:01:01.480> ahead<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.870> put<00:01:02.019> it<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
not line up so go ahead and put it the

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.450 
not line up so go ahead and put it the
correct<00:01:02.829> way<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.890> hard<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.130> do<00:01:06.310> because

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
correct way kind of hard to do because

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
correct way kind of hard to do because
I'm<00:01:06.700> trying<00:01:07.329> to<00:01:07.420> stay<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> way<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.020> camera

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I'm trying to stay on the way the camera

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.359 
I'm trying to stay on the way the camera
push<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.399> in<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:12.070> hear<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.310> snap<00:01:12.460> down<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:15.280> we

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
push it in to hear it snap down there we

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.490 
push it in to hear it snap down there we
go<00:01:15.520> there's<00:01:16.270> one<00:01:16.420> module<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:20.049> ahead<00:01:20.229> for<00:01:20.439> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
go there's one module go ahead for the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.590 
go there's one module go ahead for the
next<00:01:20.740> one<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:23.850> again<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> little<00:01:25.060> difficult

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
next one here again a little difficult

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.940 
next one here again a little difficult
to<00:01:25.630> do<00:01:25.840> because<00:01:25.990> I've<00:01:26.170> got<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.409> camera<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
to do because I've got the camera in the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.789 
to do because I've got the camera in the
way<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:29.969> goldish<00:01:30.969> color<00:01:31.750> junk<00:01:32.500> on<00:01:32.680> this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
way and this goldish color junk on this

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.639 
way and this goldish color junk on this
memory<00:01:33.219> is<00:01:33.340> supposed<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.700> be<00:01:33.789> some<00:01:34.000> kind<00:01:34.030> of

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
memory is supposed to be some kind of

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.429 
memory is supposed to be some kind of
cooling<00:01:35.649> which<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.780> doubt<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.990> really<00:01:38.259> works

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
cooling which I doubt that really works

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:48.360 
cooling which I doubt that really works
honestly<00:01:39.009> but<00:01:39.250> hey<00:01:40.060> whatever<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.820> ahead

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.610 

and<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.570> will<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.960> put<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> little<00:01:50.380> bit<00:01:50.560> of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
and you will have to put a little bit of

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.160 
and you will have to put a little bit of
pressure<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:51.070> when<00:01:51.790> you're<00:01:51.910> installing<00:01:52.090> these

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:09.780 

but<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.200> too<00:01:59.500> much<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.930> go<00:02:08.790> really

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
but not too much there you go really

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.330 
but not too much there you go really
don't<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.119> these<00:02:10.330> cooling<00:02:10.600> fans<00:02:10.960> or<00:02:11.320> pens<00:02:12.070> on

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
don't like these cooling fans or pens on

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
don't like these cooling fans or pens on
they're<00:02:12.520> not<00:02:12.670> fans<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.960> these<00:02:14.170> fans<00:02:14.530> they

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
go now you got your eight gigs of memory

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.110 
go now you got your eight gigs of memory
installed<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.220> that'll<00:02:33.820> do<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:33.940> for<00:02:34.060> this
