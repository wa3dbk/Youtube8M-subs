an<00:01:44.229> even<00:01:44.409> body<00:01:44.530> design<00:01:44.860> used<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.159> be<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.280> slab<00:01:45.610> of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
an even body design used to be a slab of

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.940 
an even body design used to be a slab of
aluminum<00:01:46.240> core<00:01:46.630> right<00:01:46.990> cnc<00:01:47.470> machining<00:01:47.860> was

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
aluminum core right cnc machining was

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.280 
aluminum core right cnc machining was
used<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.369> get<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.820> form<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
used to get it to this form and the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.810 
used to get it to this form and the
diamond<00:01:50.650> like<00:01:50.890> i<00:01:50.979> said<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.250> nice<00:01:51.430> touch<00:01:51.640> it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
diamond like i said is a nice touch it

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.120 
diamond like i said is a nice touch it
has<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.970> nice<00:01:52.210> contrast<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> ash<00:01:53.799> block

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
has a nice contrast to the ash block

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.609 
has a nice contrast to the ash block
right<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.540> raw<00:01:55.720> aluminum<00:01:55.990> look<00:01:56.350> over

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
right so it's raw aluminum look over

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.310 
right so it's raw aluminum look over
there<00:01:56.799> that's<00:01:57.580> okay<00:01:57.850> matte<00:01:58.720> finish<00:01:59.110> so<00:01:59.140> it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
there that's okay matte finish so it's

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.050 
there that's okay matte finish so it's
actually<00:01:59.380> sandblasted<00:02:00.189> material<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
actually sandblasted material on the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.969 
actually sandblasted material on the
series<00:02:01.390> there's<00:02:01.630> no<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:01.810> painted<00:02:02.259> it's<00:02:02.710> not<00:02:02.860> big

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
series there's no I painted it's not big

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.770 
series there's no I painted it's not big
it's<00:02:03.009> it's<00:02:03.310> san<00:02:03.640> blas<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.150> actually<00:02:04.390> painted

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
it's it's san blas it's actually painted

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's it's san blas it's actually painted
but<00:02:05.049> instead<00:02:05.439> of<00:02:05.560> having<00:02:05.710> lost<00:02:06.100> for<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.670> right

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
but instead of having lost for it right

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.789 
but instead of having lost for it right
it's<00:02:07.180> sandblasted<00:02:07.869> because<00:02:08.140> if<00:02:08.619> you're

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
it's sandblasted because if you're

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.069 
it's sandblasted because if you're
familiar<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:09.129> are<00:02:09.519> some<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.599> our<00:02:10.689> older

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
laptops are all glossy just nice however

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
laptops are all glossy just nice however
