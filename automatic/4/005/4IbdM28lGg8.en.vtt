00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.180
 rank of giga on the mwc 2015 I have to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.590
 just a little louder because 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 So far everything is clear 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.670
 we are again on the stand of zte 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.289
 and have a very interesting and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.340
 possible strange smartphone comes 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.270
 rather, I'll show you there 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.890
 that's the tte t60 and if you are now 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.560
 comes the backstreet boys in the background 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.320
 program to the point that the c 60 1 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.300
 rackith smartphone with 6 inch display hd 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360
 At least I believe resolution here 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.250
 the note is 12 90 x 720 go away 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590
 that is a typographical error and you 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.480
 Look, this is a smartphone with 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.980
 I'm totally sure of that with me 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.410
 will be noticed but I believe that it 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.680
 he too for construction workers, for example 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.460
 thought so in rackith smartphone has 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 a processor in it from mediatek and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 Just look 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 a bit strange, so to speak 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.370
 even we have up here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 Infrared interface we have now 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 heart mess sensor we have too 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 different sensors an airlift 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 and maybe things like that too 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 for deep sea fishermen or for employees 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 one for people who work that is 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.899
 here the brewer had that everything is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 summed up a bit on the side 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.320
 and if somehow im 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.790
 dark looking for the phone I guess 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.380
 we also have that well based on the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.929
 brightly recognizes and below we have 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 the one piece for sim cards 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.670
 micro sd cards here is micro usb's 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 everything protected with such plates and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.670
 on the back uci camera which 8 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.710
 megapixel camera 2 megapixel we have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.020
 I think that's a fingerprint 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 be there if or a gentleman 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 Heart rate monitor then this is the one up here 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.250
 does not look very very freaky house 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.250
 so 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.250
 the c6 concepts i know 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.250
 or if that is the drilling rig 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.420
 be reserved is what runs here 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 takes some getting easily customized android 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.740
 from year almost on icons but not 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 this surface known by zte 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.040
 look an android version is always 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:24.340
 442 more capacitive buttons below so 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.850
