00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.380 
soft
and<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.410> won't<00:03:05.590> form<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.550> skin<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.150> foot

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
and it won't form the skin and foot

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.390 
and it won't form the skin and foot
correctly<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.680> try<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.950> get<00:03:09.190> this

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
correctly so you have to try to get this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.120 
correctly so you have to try to get this
just<00:03:10.330> right<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.900> beginning<00:03:11.320> part<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:12.040> the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
just right the beginning part of the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.440 
just right the beginning part of the
movement

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.670 

so<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.540> want<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> make<00:03:19.900> sure<00:03:19.930> there<00:03:20.260> isn't<00:03:20.410> too

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
so you want to make sure there isn't too

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.950 
so you want to make sure there isn't too
much<00:03:20.830> air<00:03:21.190> left<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.060> batter<00:03:22.240> after<00:03:22.870> you

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
much air left in the batter after you

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.750 
much air left in the batter after you
finished<00:03:23.380> your<00:03:23.500> macaron<00:03:23.920> or<00:03:24.070> folding<00:03:24.460> so

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
finished your macaron or folding so

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.360 
finished your macaron or folding so
we're<00:03:24.940> going<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:25.540> make<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.780> lot<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.020> noise

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
we're going to now make a lot of noise

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.800 
we're going to now make a lot of noise
and<00:03:27.370> we're<00:03:27.520> going<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.000> make<00:03:28.150> sure<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.660> they

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
and we're going to make sure that they

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.330 
and we're going to make sure that they
won't<00:03:28.930> have<00:03:29.200> air<00:03:29.410> pockets<00:03:29.590> inside<00:03:30.160> the
