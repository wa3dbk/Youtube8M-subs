five ten minutes ago prior to me

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.780 
five ten minutes ago prior to me
I'm<00:00:16.620> just<00:00:16.800> always<00:00:16.980> playing<00:00:17.280> out<00:00:17.370> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> map

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
I'm just always playing out of the map

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.359 
I'm just always playing out of the map
and<00:00:18.030> then<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.780> friend<00:00:18.990> Tyler<00:00:19.310> decided<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
and then get my friend Tyler decided to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.950 
and then get my friend Tyler decided to
give<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.640> truck<00:00:21.030> or<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.480> applying<00:00:21.690> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
give this truck or so I'm applying it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710 
give this truck or so I'm applying it
and<00:00:22.410> then<00:00:22.860> all<00:00:23.520> we<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> house

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
and then all we do is that the house

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.929 
and then all we do is that the house
which<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:25.200> basement<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.490> no<00:00:26.670> idea

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
which is in the basement and not no idea

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.850 
which is in the basement and not no idea
so<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:27.840> our<00:00:28.020> third<00:00:28.050> try<00:00:28.529> trying

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
so this is actually our third try trying

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.900 
so this is actually our third try trying
to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.040> this

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.370 

see<00:00:34.910> how<00:00:34.970> far<00:00:35.210> we<00:00:35.330> can<00:00:35.480> get<00:00:35.750> just<00:00:36.050> when<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.230> two

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
see how far we can get just when the two

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.900 
see how far we can get just when the two
of<00:00:36.410> us<00:00:36.650> especially<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.370> lot<00:00:37.520> harder<00:00:37.760> than

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
of us especially a lot harder than

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.030 
of us especially a lot harder than
hitting<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.720> people<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.320> not

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
hitting that with you people but not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.500 
hitting that with you people but not
that<00:00:40.340> many<00:00:40.550> places<00:00:40.730> they<00:00:41.060> go<00:00:41.090> it's<00:00:41.360> pretty

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
that many places they go it's pretty

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.620 
that many places they go it's pretty
straight<00:00:41.870> up<00:00:42.310> as<00:00:43.310> everyone<00:00:43.670> knows<00:00:43.700> five<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.360> to

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
straight up as everyone knows five is to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.900 
straight up as everyone knows five is to
gain<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.810> Pentagon<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:46.310> you<00:00:46.520> basically<00:00:46.730> want

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
gain the Pentagon and you basically want

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.600 
gain the Pentagon and you basically want
to<00:00:47.060> start<00:00:47.330> off<00:00:47.650> another<00:00:48.650> game<00:00:48.920> like<00:00:49.130> any<00:00:49.430> other

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
to start off another game like any other

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.400 
to start off another game like any other
zombies<00:00:49.970> game<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.450> know<00:00:50.570> just<00:00:50.989> pass<00:00:51.200> the

zombies game you know just pass the
windows<00:00:51.800> at<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.190> points<00:00:52.640> one<00:00:53.360> round<00:00:53.570> was<00:00:53.660> it

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
windows at the points one round was it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.770 
windows at the points one round was it
going<00:00:54.580> and<00:00:55.580> then<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:55.760> know<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.090> got<00:00:56.510> up<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780

the third or fourth level and then after

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.660 
the third or fourth level and then after

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the fourth level it's basically straight

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.979 
the fourth level it's basically straight
up<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.090> know<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:02.390> keep<00:01:02.540> doing<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.840> same

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
thing over and over so I skipped around

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.970 
thing over and over so I skipped around
to<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.150> fourth<00:01:05.390> round<00:01:05.600> over<00:01:05.840> here<00:01:06.050> and<00:01:06.260> then
