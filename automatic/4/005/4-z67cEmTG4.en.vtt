00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.160
 hi to all and sonia to click nkou 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.980
 point fr today I propose a 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.690
 small recipe that is done in 3 minutes 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.320
 and that cooks in 20 seconds at 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.209
 microwave 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.280
 it's quite practical for the days 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.410
 go shopping we are hungry we are 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.150
 tired we do not want to cook and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.650
 we can do it with really all 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.580
 kinds of ingredients that's really 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 according to your tastes 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.060
 we're going to make happy cocotte with a 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.279
 microwave cooking 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.539
 you can also bake them but 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.940
 it takes a little more time 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.420
 so for this recipe I need to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.829
 semi-thick or thick cream 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 I use bacon but you 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.270
 finally some bacon but you can 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 use in the round of liver chorizo 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.840
 fat or even downright do not put it 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 one egg per casserole and it's a casserole 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.699
 per person that expensive with little ones 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.250
 pieces of toast and salad 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.989
 salt of pepper and cheese 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.910
 so I used cheese from 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.059
 goat but you can use some 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.590
 body yesterday we put a first spoon 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.950
 of fresh cream in the bottom of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 her casserole 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:22.210
 then we slide the egg trying to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:26.110
 keep the yellow without breaking we know 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.850
 a spoon of fresh cream that you 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.870
 can put more - it's really 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 according to your tastes bacon or ham or 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.380
 something else but first the salt and the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.160
 pepper 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.890
 not too much salt since and bacon a 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.800
 little pinch anyway and then the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 cheese 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 you can leave to be a child 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.030
 whole cuts and that's like 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.030
 you want 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.370
 and now it's gone for 20 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.060
 seconds of cooking in the microwave to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.610
 full power 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.410
 small rectification the time depends on 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.060
 microwaves on the new microwave 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.630
 those forty seconds before that was 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.370
 rather 20 25 seconds so you put to 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.260
 about 20 seconds and then you 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.350
 watch you add if necessary 10 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.600
 seconds or 20 seconds like that I had to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.850
 do it I hope this little video 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.260
 fast you liked it we find ourselves very 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.800
