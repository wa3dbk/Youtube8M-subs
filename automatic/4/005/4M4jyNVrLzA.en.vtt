00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.610
 where is each meal worth where it is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.820
 normal to eat where people are 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.950
 a little degenerate vale is the first 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.430
 The world's rarest food is the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.920
 crispy tarantula and is eaten in cambodia 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.840
 yes I had to see a picture of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 as a woman ate a tarantula and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.820
 It's not pretty I've covered it with my hand 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.060
 because it's not pretty the second is the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.550
 sheep eye juice in Mongolia is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.340
 say these come to galicia and instead of 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.500
 give them to graze the sheep what 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 they do is take what chopsticks go to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 remove the eyes of the sheep by the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.860
 good world 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.990
 the third weirdest meal is the game 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.500
 centenary that is made in china and is a 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.440
 mixture of clay ash and salt should 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.130
 be super rich to take alone without 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.830
 water or anything a point the fourth the most 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.560
 strange of the planet is a fat and skin 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.340
 of frozen whale in greenland 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.590
 because greenland makes us these 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.420
 things because they eat the whales is 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.080
 say the fifth weirdest meal in the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.380
 planet is the chicken legs if the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.240
 leg paws in china sell them 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.610
 as if you go to a McDonald's and ask 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.580
 some chips because there are legs 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.980
 of chicken to eat with your hamburger 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.260
 fuck what disgust the sixth meal more 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.260
 strange of the world is the cheese with 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.330
 worms the worms are alive when 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.209
 you eat them no no they do not bother 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.650
 killing them are not alive and you have to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.110
 be very careful makes me the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.540
 fast cheese because those worms that 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.120
 they are living there, it turns out that 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 they jump right and at least they jump 15 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.130
 centimeters so if you love them 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 eat 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.740
 so do not expect to beat them to do it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.560
 fast and the seventh is made in Sardinia 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 rarest thing in the world mexico no 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.950
 I was expecting this from you , I did not expect that 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.770
 this country was in this ranking 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.730
 because one of the countries with more more 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.030
 audience of my channel are in this 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.790
 ranking I do not want there is a very 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.100
 rich that is called escamoles I put that 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.650
 some in Mexico you will know 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.120
 I hope that I do not expect not because they are 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.410
 ant larvae because you eat the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.360
 children of the hours 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.320
 the eighth strangest meal in the world 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.390
 talk time balloon and eat in japan os 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.550
 I swear that just the countries that you are 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.830
 seeing are you who have the meals 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.680
 more rare after the tarantula and the 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.130
 cheese with worms ok we had mexico 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.370
 with here the larvae of the ants but 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:15.410
 Peru but it is not left behind but it is not 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.150
 is left behind because you eat guinea pig 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.730
 he had a cabin worth as he is escaping 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.310
 I eat food when dead what disgust 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.710
 jolin is like in china counted coming cat 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.710
 because you eat a mackerel are 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.860
 because the victim food more weird than 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.320
 exists in china obviously they are the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.720
 seahorses the starfish and 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.970
 the scorpions on sticks as if 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.400
 they were pinchos morunos, so yes, the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.530
 eleventh strangest meal in the world 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.100
 that has also given me a lot of disgust 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.650
 this philippines and there it turns out that 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.850
 you eat the developed fetus 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.910
 a duck because someone can explain me 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.800
 why is it done that she had tenth 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.139
 place we have in hong kong a 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.090
 delicatessen of these crises your oyster 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.729
 When I go to Hong Kong, I have to try 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.009
 these uncles and dry lizard these are 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.289
 others of the people who can come to 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.570
 my garden and you can have a banquet 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.430
 but a pretty vibrant banquet is worth 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.500
 good not only achieve your person 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.570
 guarantees with work of all I suppose the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.479
 thirteenth place we have to Korea 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.310
 south where with my body body alive and 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.630
 it's a meal that you have to have a lot 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.390
 careful to eat it because 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.820
 com is bad you have bad luck 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.190
 tentacles can be grasped by 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.710
 inside the throat or on the palate or 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.840
 anything and then like that is not 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.880
 nice to know if going to the hospital is 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.400
 is real in the fourteenth place 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.560
 we have again to japan because in japan 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.120
 they like japan and china very much- the truth 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.940
 is that they are my favorite countries to go 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.420
 to eat if you have sushi I am if the switch 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.460
 It's delicious because they have sushi 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.780
 the time they also eat chicken feet 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.390
 uncle I do not understand 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.450
 in Japan they eat the giant eyes of 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.760
 tuna more or less the same as those of the 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.770
 sheep the juice of the eye of the sheep 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.020
 but I guess this one eats the eye 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.420
 whole and we do not know and how not in 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.240
 fifteenth place we have china another 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.670

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.910
 try and so when it's a bit older and 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.150
 not of rat you know this chapter of the 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.460
 simpson is worth the one in which they make milk with 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.060
 sewer rats and I'm thinking 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.270
 how do they make a rat's wine 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.690
 they make normal wine and then go to rats 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.420
 or they put rat death or do it already with 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.820
 the blood of the rat because it could be 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.530
 anything that is here one of the 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.900
 most disgusting videos that I've done in 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.060
