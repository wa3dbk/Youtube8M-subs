00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
picture that stayed there once it was

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.380 
picture that stayed there once it was
done<00:02:15.270> developing<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> love<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.270> put

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
done developing and I love you just put

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.670 
done developing and I love you just put
in<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.480> pocket<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.080> person<00:02:19.170> move<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:21.680> so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
in your pocket or in person move on so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
in your pocket or in person move on so
does<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.860> neat<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.190> record<00:02:23.910> some<00:02:24.090> images

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.220 

now<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.560> real<00:02:28.740> sure<00:02:29.930> whether<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.170> is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
now I'm not real sure whether this is

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.380 
now I'm not real sure whether this is
the<00:02:31.410> sensor<00:02:31.920> well<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.060> don't<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.330> I

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the sensor well this is I don't know I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.470 
the sensor well this is I don't know I
have<00:02:33.720> too<00:02:33.810> often<00:02:33.990> put<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.450> part<00:02:36.450> of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
have too often put that up but part of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.640 
have too often put that up but part of
me<00:02:36.540> thinks<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:36.930> part<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.410> sensor

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
me thinks this is part of the sensor

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.750 
me thinks this is part of the sensor
because<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:37.950> got<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.130> little<00:02:38.250> thing<00:02:38.400> here

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
because it's got a little thing here

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.650 
because it's got a little thing here
that<00:02:38.850> makes<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.209> darker<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.940> maybe<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.540> an

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
that makes it darker that maybe like an

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.449 
that makes it darker that maybe like an
off<00:02:42.810> switch<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.280> got

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
off switch I don't know but it's got

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.590 
off switch I don't know but it's got
well<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> want<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> see<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> while<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> push

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
well I want you to see it while I push

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.590 
well I want you to see it while I push
it<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.230> way<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:51.420> eaten

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
it this way as a little eaten

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.120 
it this way as a little eaten
comes<00:02:51.690> around<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.290> stripe<00:02:52.620> line<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
comes around a little stripe line so I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.640 
comes around a little stripe line so I
don't<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.370> that's<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.910> make<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> darker<00:02:54.650> or

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
don't know that's to make it darker or

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
don't know that's to make it darker or
change<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> exposure<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:57.030> fences<00:02:57.390> on/off

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
change the exposure or fences on/off

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.900 
change the exposure or fences on/off
switch<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.200> looks<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> would<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.910> some

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
switch it looks like it would be some

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.800 
switch it looks like it would be some
kind<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> exposure<00:03:00.450> thing<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.020> don't<00:03:01.290> know

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
kind of exposure thing but I don't know

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.970 
kind of exposure thing but I don't know
nothing<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.050> want<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> notice<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.680> with

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
nothing you want to notice is that with

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.150 
nothing you want to notice is that with
the<00:03:05.310> viewfinder<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.560> actual<00:03:07.680> shutter<00:03:08.010> in

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the viewfinder and the actual shutter in

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.770 
the viewfinder and the actual shutter in
two<00:03:08.400> different<00:03:08.580> locations<00:03:08.700> they're<00:03:09.570> close

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
two different locations they're close

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.449 
two different locations they're close
together<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.320> they're<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.739> same<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
together but they're not the same so you

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880 
together but they're not the same so you
know<00:03:12.180> exactly<00:03:12.540> what<00:03:12.810> you're<00:03:12.870> looking<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.739> see

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
know exactly what you're looking to see

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.130 
know exactly what you're looking to see
exactly<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.459> shutter<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.140> that's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
exactly to the shutter so it's that's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.740 
exactly to the shutter so it's that's
little<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.800> downside<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:18.030> now<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.510> I

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
little bit of a downside but now not I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.800 
little bit of a downside but now not I
