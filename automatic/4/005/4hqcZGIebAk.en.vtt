doing missions to tell you how to get
those<00:00:11.370> apps<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> over<00:00:13.320> here<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.650> many

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
those apps so over here you have many

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.510 
those apps so over here you have many
different<00:00:14.610> types<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.940> sets<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.540> missions<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
different types of sets of missions and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.830 
different types of sets of missions and
these<00:00:17.520> separate<00:00:17.970> things<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.300> called<00:00:18.449> mission

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
these separate things are called mission

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320 
these separate things are called mission
cards<00:00:19.260> now<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> complete<00:00:20.609> every

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
cards now you have to complete every

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
cards now you have to complete every
single<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.560> say<00:00:22.710> point<00:00:22.949> blank

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
single one and they all say point blank

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.450 
single one and they all say point blank
so<00:00:23.730> they<00:00:23.880> all<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.240> ten<00:00:24.710> letters<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:26.070> ten

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so they all have ten letters or ten

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.640 
so they all have ten letters or ten

skills<00:01:02.699> sometimes<00:01:03.420> people<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.930> confused<00:01:04.110> by

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
skills sometimes people get confused by

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.910 
skills sometimes people get confused by
this<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.369> means<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.720> SG<00:01:07.229> SG<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this this means because SG SG I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
this this means because SG SG I
interactive<00:01:08.430> did<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.880> state<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.049> right

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
interactive did not state this right

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 
interactive did not state this right
which<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.430> should<00:01:11.580> fix<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.970> but

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
which I think they should fix it but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.170 
which I think they should fix it but
this<00:01:12.450> means<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:14.549> use<00:01:14.670> any<00:01:14.850> gun<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this means that you can use any gun you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.109 
this means that you can use any gun you
want<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> kill<00:01:17.430> anything<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
want but you have to kill anything that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.200 
want but you have to kill anything that
has<00:01:18.750> smv<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> messed<00:01:20.970> up

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
has smv so it's like kind of messed up

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.469 
has smv so it's like kind of messed up
it<00:01:21.330> should<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.600> enemy<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.200> SMG<00:01:22.799> kills<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it should say enemy use SMG kills so it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
it should say enemy use SMG kills so it
means<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.080> enemy<00:01:25.350> should<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.650> moving<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.100> SMG

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
means the enemy should be moving an SMG

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.249 
means the enemy should be moving an SMG
which<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.030> basically<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.750> can't<00:01:27.960> find<00:01:28.170> out

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
which is basically you can't find out

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
which is basically you can't find out
about<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> since<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.520> find<00:01:29.820> out

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
about that and since you can't find out

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.490 
about that and since you can't find out
about<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.439> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
about that this one will be kind of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.810 
about that this one will be kind of
based<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> lock<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> kill

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
based on lock you just have to kill

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.740 
based on lock you just have to kill
where<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> find<00:01:34.579> now<00:01:35.579> every<00:01:36.329> mission

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
where we can find now every mission

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
where we can find now every mission
various<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:38.009> goes<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.400> from<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
various and it goes down from the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
various and it goes down from the
training<00:01:39.060> card<00:01:39.329> set<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> mainly<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
training card set which is mainly I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
training card set which is mainly I
can't<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> need<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
can't get it because you need to be a
