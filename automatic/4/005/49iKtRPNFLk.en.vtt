goes<00:00:52.410> into<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:52.800> experiment<00:00:53.399> knowing<00:00:53.910> one

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
goes into an experiment knowing one

goes into an experiment knowing one
could

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
could

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.040

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
to the rowing I suggest you do we're

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.639 
to the rowing I suggest you do we're
never<00:01:01.699> going<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.059> get<00:01:02.239> there<00:01:02.420> no<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:03.199> mean<00:01:03.589> I

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
never going to get there no I mean I

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.439 
never going to get there no I mean I
greatly<00:01:04.100> appreciate<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.149> you<00:01:05.269> would

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
greatly appreciate it if you would

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.350 
greatly appreciate it if you would
assist<00:01:05.899> perhaps<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.740> should<00:01:06.890> ask<00:01:06.920> him

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
assist perhaps you should ask him

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.490 
assist perhaps you should ask him
imagine<00:01:08.360> he<00:01:08.479> is<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.630> greater<00:01:08.960> interest<00:01:09.200> in

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
imagine he is a greater interest in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.289 
imagine he is a greater interest in
getting<00:01:09.590> there<00:01:09.890> than<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.159> do<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.670> suppose<00:01:11.149> he

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
getting there than I do I suppose he

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.630 
getting there than I do I suppose he
does<00:01:11.509> there's<00:01:12.350> no<00:01:12.470> point<00:01:12.740> in<00:01:12.860> asking<00:01:12.950> why<00:01:13.610> not

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
does there's no point in asking why not

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.210 
does there's no point in asking why not
because<00:01:14.450> he<00:01:14.600> doesn't<00:01:14.810> roll<00:01:15.200> he<00:01:15.680> doesn't<00:01:15.979> grow

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
because he doesn't roll he doesn't grow

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.480 
because he doesn't roll he doesn't grow
no<00:01:17.020> cows<00:01:18.020> negro<00:01:18.500> oh<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:19.430> see<00:01:19.970> what<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.149> mean<00:01:21.490> 4k

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
no cows negro oh I see what you mean 4k

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.450 
no cows negro oh I see what you mean 4k
is<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.789> new<00:01:23.119> resolution<00:01:23.570> standard<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.950> isn't

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
is a new resolution standard that isn't

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.700 
is a new resolution standard that isn't
all<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.640> standard<00:01:26.360> it's<00:01:26.930> got<00:01:27.170> several

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
all that standard it's got several

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.950 
all that standard it's got several
resolutions<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.580> are<00:01:28.640> considered<00:01:29.149> 4k<00:01:29.630> but

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
resolutions that are considered 4k but

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260 
resolutions that are considered 4k but
the<00:01:30.110> most<00:01:30.319> standard<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.369> resolutions<00:01:32.060> is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
the most standard of the resolutions is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.600 
the most standard of the resolutions is
3840<00:01:32.810> x<00:01:33.460> 2160<00:01:34.460> or<00:01:35.240> take<00:01:35.720> 1080p<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:37.039> multiply

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
3840 x 2160 or take 1080p then multiply

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.450 
3840 x 2160 or take 1080p then multiply
it<00:01:37.640> by<00:01:37.850> two<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.659> each<00:01:38.840> direction<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.100> about

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
it by two in each direction so about

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.779 
it by two in each direction so about
four<00:01:40.940> x<00:01:41.270> 1080<00:01:41.750> it's<00:01:42.380> quite<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.679> jump<00:01:43.039> from<00:01:43.310> 2k

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
four x 1080 it's quite the jump from 2k

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.309 
four x 1080 it's quite the jump from 2k
resolutions<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.600> have<00:01:44.659> been<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.049> king
