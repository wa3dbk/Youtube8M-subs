working on this auxilary boo sport here
that's<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> same<00:00:56.070> principle<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:56.940> be

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that's the same principle as it would be

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's the same principle as it would be
down<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> transfer<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.039> in

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
down here on the transfer is they go in

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400 
down here on the transfer is they go in
at<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> right<00:00:59.820> angle<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:00.960> angle

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
at a right angle with the right angle

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
at a right angle with the right angle
well<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.980> you'll<00:01:02.129> give<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> chipping

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
well what you'll give is this chipping

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.899 
well what you'll give is this chipping
and<00:01:03.359> sputtering<00:01:04.110> let<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.320> show<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.729> see<00:01:05.729> that

the intake side which is sometimes an
ideal<00:03:15.720> situation<00:03:16.019> because<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:17.549> want<00:03:17.730> that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
ideal situation because you want that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.089 
ideal situation because you want that
that<00:03:19.200> column<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.739> air<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.579> be<00:03:20.760> towards<00:03:21.209> the

the<00:03:25.110> piston<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.590> how<00:03:25.739> do<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.920> do<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.099> if<00:03:26.310> I'm<00:03:26.430> up

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
the piston so how do I do that if I'm up

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.339 
the piston so how do I do that if I'm up
here<00:03:26.790> because<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.870> get<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.170> same

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
here because when you get in the same

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
the shank up to this so call it time it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.960 
the shank up to this so call it time it
down<00:04:10.099> now<00:04:11.099> I'm<00:04:11.250> ready<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.579> go

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
down now I'm ready to go

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.860 
down now I'm ready to go
now<00:04:12.239> let's<00:04:12.450> show<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.690> how<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.079> works<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
now let's show you how that works on the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.270 
now let's show you how that works on the
what's<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:15.930> what<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.769> called<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
what's that what this is called it the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.730 
what's that what this is called it the
contra<00:04:17.729> angle<00:04:19.039> so<00:04:20.039> we're<00:04:20.700> up<00:04:20.820> here<00:04:21.590> on<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
contra angle so we're up here on the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.260 
contra angle so we're up here on the
contra<00:04:23.160> angle<00:04:24.050> we<00:04:25.050> don't<00:04:25.260> work<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.500> for<00:04:26.270> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
contra angle we don't work that for this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.240 
contra angle we don't work that for this
one

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
one

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.690 
one
resent<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.150> side<00:04:29.590> well<00:04:30.590> because<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.460> left

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
resent that side well because the left

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.320 
resent that side well because the left
hand<00:04:31.850> cut<00:04:32.590> bar<00:04:33.590> is<00:04:33.950> pulling<00:04:34.430> towards<00:04:35.090> is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
hand cut bar is pulling towards is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.730 
hand cut bar is pulling towards is
coming<00:04:35.660> towards<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.080> side

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
coming towards this side

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.710 
coming towards this side
it<00:04:37.070> pushes<00:04:37.460> towards<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.120> makes<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.510> nice<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
it pushes towards it makes it nice and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.410 
it pushes towards it makes it nice and
smooth<00:04:39.170> whereas<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.950> right<00:04:40.130> hand<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.670> good

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
smooth whereas the right hand is good

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.870 
smooth whereas the right hand is good
for<00:04:41.690> motoring<00:04:42.110> towards<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.560> side<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.070> it's

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
for motoring towards this side so it's

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880 
for motoring towards this side so it's
just<00:04:44.090> decided<00:04:44.690> which<00:04:44.870> one<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.230> will<00:04:45.350> use<00:04:45.410> now

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
just decided which one you will use now

just decided which one you will use now
sometimes<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.670> guess<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.360> said<00:04:47.570> look<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:49.090> can<00:04:50.090> wear
