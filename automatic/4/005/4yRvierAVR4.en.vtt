00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
it's been raining for the last couple

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.220 
it's been raining for the last couple
weeks<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.250> all<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.819> these<00:00:06.000> weeds<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:06.930> kind

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
weeks and all of these weeds just kind

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.299 
weeks and all of these weeds just kind
of<00:00:07.290> sprouted<00:00:08.099> up<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.519> nowhere

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
of sprouted up out of nowhere

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.799 
of sprouted up out of nowhere
I've<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.880> finished<00:00:12.120> spraying<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.110> with

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
I've just finished spraying it all with

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.450 
I've just finished spraying it all with
ortho<00:00:15.809> ground<00:00:16.379> clear<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.859> that's<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> brand

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.720 

so<00:00:20.460> we'll<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.380> in<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> couple<00:00:22.500> days<00:00:25.490> how<00:00:26.490> this

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so we'll see in a couple days how this

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
so we'll see in a couple days how this
these<00:00:27.000> weeds<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.830> dying<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> about

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
these weeds are dying so this is about

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
these weeds are dying so this is about
24<00:00:32.940> hours<00:00:33.120> later<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:36.030> looks<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.480> most<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
24 hours later it looks like most of the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.030 
24 hours later it looks like most of the
lushness<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.700> gone<00:00:39.260> everything<00:00:40.260> seems<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> be

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
lushness is gone everything seems to be

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.680 
lushness is gone everything seems to be
dying<00:00:44.930> figuring<00:00:45.930> about<00:00:46.820> maybe<00:00:47.820> another<00:00:48.090> day

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
dying figuring about maybe another day

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
dying figuring about maybe another day
or<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> couple<00:00:49.620> days<00:00:50.120> most<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.539> just

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
or a couple days most of this will just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
or a couple days most of this will just
be<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.879> disintegrated<00:00:54.590> dead<00:00:55.590> brush<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
be pretty disintegrated dead brush I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
be pretty disintegrated dead brush I
just<00:00:57.140> use<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.289> rake<00:00:58.500> pick<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.550> up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
just use a rake pick it all up

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.930 
just use a rake pick it all up
it<00:01:00.800> looks<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.309> ground<00:01:02.550> clear<00:01:02.730> works

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it looks like the ground clear works

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.010 
it looks like the ground clear works
pretty<00:01:03.120> good

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.160 

and<00:01:07.020> we'll<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.409> again<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.539> couple<00:01:09.570> days<00:01:09.960> or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and we'll see again in a couple days or

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
and we'll see again in a couple days or
so<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.649> we<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.799> probably<00:01:11.579> about<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.179> week

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so here we are probably about a week

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.760 
so here we are probably about a week
later<00:01:14.030> pretty<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.149> everything<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.770> crumpled

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
later pretty much everything is crumpled

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.209 
later pretty much everything is crumpled
up<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.219> dead<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.219> difference

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
up and dead you can see a difference

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.270 
up and dead you can see a difference
from<00:01:23.429> when<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.969> first<00:01:24.240> started<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.280> becoming

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
from when we first started it's becoming

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
from when we first started it's becoming
pretty<00:01:26.579> desolate<00:01:26.819> I<00:01:27.000> probably<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.539> come<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pretty desolate I probably can come in

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.459 
pretty desolate I probably can come in
here<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> rake<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.479> pull

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
here with a rake and just kind of pull

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.109 
here with a rake and just kind of pull
things<00:01:31.649> out<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.039> ground<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:34.049> did<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
things out of the ground we did have a

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.029 
things out of the ground we did have a
rain<00:01:36.119> yesterday<00:01:36.420> which<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.289> knocked

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
rain yesterday which kind of knocked

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.270 
rain yesterday which kind of knocked
down<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.819> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.409> dead<00:01:40.409> bodies<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.159> were

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
down some of the dead bodies that were

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.410 
down some of the dead bodies that were
hanging<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.789> know<00:01:41.849> sticking<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.239> out<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
hanging and you know sticking up out of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.149 
hanging and you know sticking up out of
the<00:01:42.509> ground

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
the ground

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.669 
the ground
so<00:01:44.159> looks<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.060> ortho<00:01:46.020> ground<00:01:46.289> clear<00:01:46.470> works

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
so looks like ortho ground clear works

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.210 
so looks like ortho ground clear works
pretty<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.789> least<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.739> killing<00:01:50.039> part

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
pretty good at least in the killing part

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
pretty good at least in the killing part
I<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.179> if<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I don't know if it how it is is a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.559 
I don't know if it how it is is a
pre-emergent<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:56.149> seems<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.420> pretty

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
pre-emergent so seems like it's pretty

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.469 
pre-emergent so seems like it's pretty
good<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:58.500> good<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.399> here's<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.969> ortho

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
good very good so here's the ortho

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.809 
good very good so here's the ortho
ground<00:02:00.719> clear<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:02.009> gallons<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:02.489> I<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.789> a

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
ground clear to gallons because I have a

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.050 
ground clear to gallons because I have a
lot<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> yard<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.569> I<00:02:04.319> have<00:02:04.469> my<00:02:04.649> sprayer<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.030> I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
lot of yard and I have my sprayer here I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.050 
lot of yard and I have my sprayer here I
usually<00:02:06.289> put<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.409> half<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.039> gallon<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
usually put in half a gallon of the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.580 
usually put in half a gallon of the
ground<00:02:09.329> clear<00:02:10.639> and<00:02:11.639> this<00:02:12.450> container<00:02:13.139> here<00:02:13.380> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ground clear and this container here is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.460 
ground clear and this container here is
I<00:02:15.410> usually<00:02:16.410> fill<00:02:16.859> it<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> two<00:02:17.430> gallon<00:02:17.760> mark

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I usually fill it to the two gallon mark

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.890 
I usually fill it to the two gallon mark
with<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.709> water<00:02:20.180> after<00:02:21.180> having<00:02:21.450> put<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
with the water after having put the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.009 
with the water after having put the
ground<00:02:22.889> clear<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:24.269> slightly

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
ground clear in there that's slightly

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.110 
ground clear in there that's slightly
stronger<00:02:25.230> than<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> recommended<00:02:25.920> dose<00:02:26.400> only

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
stronger than the recommended dose only

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.789 
stronger than the recommended dose only
because<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.650> way<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.950> measured<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.799> it

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
because of the way it's measured but it

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.780 
because of the way it's measured but it
seems<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.420> work<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.660> me
