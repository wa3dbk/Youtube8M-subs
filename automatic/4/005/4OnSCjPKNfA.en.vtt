00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.160 

okay<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.070> basically<00:00:02.790> reassembly<00:00:03.689> again<00:00:03.959> with

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay so basically reassembly again with

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.829 
okay so basically reassembly again with
the<00:00:04.380> new<00:00:04.770> shock<00:00:05.040> mounts<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:06.240> now<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.660> see

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the new shock mounts so now you can see

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.200 
the new shock mounts so now you can see
that<00:00:07.049> shock<00:00:07.379> has<00:00:07.680> got<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> whole<00:00:08.519> different

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
that shock has got a whole different

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
that shock has got a whole different
angle<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:11.040> very

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
angle to it and it's actually very

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.730 
angle to it and it's actually very
comparable<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.509> angle<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> shocks<00:00:13.469> in

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
comparable to the angle of the shocks in

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.519 
comparable to the angle of the shocks in
the<00:00:13.799> rear<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.780> today<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.929> working<00:00:16.139> on

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the rear and today I was working on

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.460 
the rear and today I was working on
these<00:00:16.740> shock<00:00:17.340> towers<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.350> couple<00:00:19.350> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
these shock towers and a couple of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.720 
these shock towers and a couple of
videos<00:00:19.770> back<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.180> was<00:00:21.180> showing<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.480> guys<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
videos back I was showing you guys how I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.189 
videos back I was showing you guys how I
determine<00:00:23.730> where<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> shock<00:00:24.720> mount<00:00:24.930> needs

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
determine where this a shock mount needs

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.790 
determine where this a shock mount needs
to<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:27.330> made<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.230> stuff<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to be and I made this stuff up a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
to be and I made this stuff up a
recently<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> needs<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> welding<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.390> this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
recently so it needs to welding it this

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
recently so it needs to welding it this
is<00:00:31.260> part<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.560> an<00:00:31.679> X<00:00:31.859> brace<00:00:32.180> goes<00:00:33.180> across<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is part of an X brace goes across to the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
is part of an X brace goes across to the
other<00:00:33.840> side<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> similar

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
other side see and then a similar

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
other side see and then a similar
structure<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.140> side<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
structure here on this side this one is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
structure here on this side this one is
still<00:00:40.530> spot<00:00:40.980> welded<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.940> piece<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
still spot welded on here this piece is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.860 
still spot welded on here this piece is
loose

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
loose

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.400 
loose
you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:44.239> got<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.450> welding<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.140> here

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
you know got a lot of welding to do here

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.670 
you know got a lot of welding to do here
and<00:00:46.789> this<00:00:47.789> piece<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:51.379> part<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> X<00:00:52.680> brace

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
and this piece here part of the X brace

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
and this piece here part of the X brace
so<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.280> quite<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> quite<00:00:57.300> an<00:00:57.449> angle<00:00:57.899> on

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so it's got quite a quite an angle on

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.889 
so it's got quite a quite an angle on
that<00:00:58.559> notch<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.809> ended<00:01:00.809> up

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that notch there and actually ended up

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.529 
that notch there and actually ended up
doing<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:02.010> angle<00:01:02.609> grinder<00:01:02.640> by<00:01:03.120> hand

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
doing this with my angle grinder by hand

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.960 
doing this with my angle grinder by hand
my<00:01:04.290> tubing<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.040> sure<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> won't<00:01:05.580> make<00:01:05.820> an

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
my tubing not sure it won't make an

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.010 
my tubing not sure it won't make an
angle<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.840> extreme<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.299> make<00:01:09.479> these<00:01:09.689> what

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
angle that extreme so to make these what

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.039 
angle that extreme so to make these what
I<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.500> cut<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> tubing<00:01:11.159> off<00:01:11.369> at

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
I do is I cut the tubing off at

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.090 
I do is I cut the tubing off at
approximately<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.080> correct<00:01:13.500> angle<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
approximately the correct angle but I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
approximately the correct angle but I
cut<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.390> long<00:01:15.570> side<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.439> maybe

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
cut it off on the long side like maybe

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
cut it off on the long side like maybe
half<00:01:17.369> an<00:01:17.549> inch<00:01:17.670> too<00:01:17.850> long<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
half an inch too long or something and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.310 
half an inch too long or something and
then<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.740> start<00:01:20.009> carving<00:01:20.250> away<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.689> what

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
then I start carving away at it to what

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
then I start carving away at it to what
kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.460> probably<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
kind of I think is probably about the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200 
kind of I think is probably about the
right<00:01:24.450> shape<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.430> back<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.970> fit

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right shape and then I go back and I fit

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.580 
right shape and then I go back and I fit
it<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:29.299> actually<00:01:30.299> fit<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it and I actually fit this in first I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.510 
it and I actually fit this in first I
got<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.250> end<00:01:32.490> fitting<00:01:32.820> nice<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:34.520> this

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
got this end fitting nice and then this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
got this end fitting nice and then this
one<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.150> next<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> probably<00:01:37.290> went<00:01:37.619> back

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
one was next and I probably went back

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.200 
one was next and I probably went back
and<00:01:38.070> forth<00:01:38.509> just<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.990> notch<00:01:40.350> here

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
and forth just on this notch here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.550 
and forth just on this notch here
notching<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.270> by<00:01:42.450> hand<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.899> probably<00:01:43.140> went<00:01:43.409> back

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
notching it by hand I probably went back

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.510 
notching it by hand I probably went back
and<00:01:43.740> forth<00:01:43.890> ten<00:01:44.280> times<00:01:45.110> at<00:01:46.110> least<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:47.399> know

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and forth ten times at least you know

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
and forth ten times at least you know
back<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> forth<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.479> grind<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> little

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
back and forth you know grind a little

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
back and forth you know grind a little
go<00:01:49.380> back<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> test<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.430> grope<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> know

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
go back and test and then grope you know

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.230 
go back and test and then grope you know
till<00:01:51.979> finally<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.040> got<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.549> where<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
till finally I got to where I want and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649 
till finally I got to where I want and
the<00:01:54.299> idea<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.399> slowly<00:01:56.399> sneak<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the idea is to slowly sneak up on the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.950 
the idea is to slowly sneak up on the
shape<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.219> as<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.790> getting<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.240> fine-tune

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
shape and as as I'm getting it fine-tune

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
shape and as as I'm getting it fine-tune
with<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> shape<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.670> also<00:02:02.880> getting<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
with the shape then it's also getting a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
with the shape then it's also getting a
little<00:02:03.479> shorter<00:02:03.990> each<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.619> mess

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
little shorter each time that I mess

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
little shorter each time that I mess
with<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:06.119> by<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> time<00:02:07.079> I've<00:02:07.259> got<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
with it and then by the time I've got it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
with it and then by the time I've got it
into<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:07.950> shape<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.429> basically<00:02:09.209> we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
into the right shape then basically we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.490 
into the right shape then basically we
got<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.440> shape<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> length

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
got the shape and the length

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.600 
got the shape and the length
correct<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:13.240> was<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.420> big<00:02:13.570> job<00:02:13.840> actually

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
correct that was a big job actually

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.310 
correct that was a big job actually
getting<00:02:15.610> these<00:02:15.730> pieces<00:02:16.030> done<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> yeah

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
getting these pieces done so yeah

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.100 
getting these pieces done so yeah
and<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.460> using<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.910> cheap<00:02:25.180> vendor<00:02:25.570> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and I was using that cheap vendor to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.510 
and I was using that cheap vendor to
make<00:02:26.140> these<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.570> recorded<00:02:28.570> some<00:02:28.750> video<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
make these and I recorded some video of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.440 
make these and I recorded some video of
bending<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> these<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.330> I'm

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
bending one of these and I think I'm

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.990 
bending one of these and I think I'm
going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> play<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.959> for<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.170> guys<00:02:32.350> now<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
going to play that for you guys now so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.880 
going to play that for you guys now so
the<00:02:34.240> trick<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.510> bending<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.230> tubing<00:02:35.680> with

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the trick to bending this tubing with

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.610 
the trick to bending this tubing with
this<00:02:36.070> bender<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.730> using<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.630> die<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.260> one

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
this bender is using a die that's one

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.190 
this bender is using a die that's one
size<00:02:38.860> too<00:02:39.220> small<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.850> then<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> tubing<00:02:41.050> it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
size too small and then that tubing it's

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080 
size too small and then that tubing it's
just<00:02:41.440> kind<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.770> forced<00:02:42.370> right<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.880> there

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
just kind of like forced right in there

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.210 
just kind of like forced right in there
right<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> bottom<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.110> die<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.680> it's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
right to the bottom of that die and it's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.720 
right to the bottom of that die and it's
held<00:02:45.459> really<00:02:45.760> tight<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.209> then<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.620> manages<00:02:48.459> to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
held really tight and then it manages to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:53.080 
held really tight and then it manages to
keep<00:02:49.239> its<00:02:49.450> shape

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.230 

once<00:03:53.569> I<00:03:53.720> had<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:53.959> bend<00:03:54.500> made<00:03:54.890> then<00:03:55.850> what<00:03:56.209> I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
once I had that bend made then what I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.690 
once I had that bend made then what I
did<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.600> I<00:03:56.690> cut<00:03:56.900> off<00:03:57.140> almost<00:03:57.950> all<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.459> bend

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
did is I cut off almost all of the bend

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880 
did is I cut off almost all of the bend
so<00:03:59.180> this<00:03:59.360> is<00:03:59.540> it's<00:03:59.930> actually<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.350> scrap<00:04:00.680> piece

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
so this is it's actually a scrap piece

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.420 
so this is it's actually a scrap piece
now<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.970> see<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.709> see<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> bend<00:04:04.250> is

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
now you can see you can see the bend is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.180 
now you can see you can see the bend is
just<00:04:04.700> starting<00:04:05.360> here<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:06.230> most<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.830> Bend<00:04:07.040> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
just starting here so most of the Bend I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.970 
just starting here so most of the Bend I
left<00:04:07.520> intact<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.660> then<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.350> got<00:04:09.560> welded

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
left intact and then that got welded

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.059 
left intact and then that got welded
into<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.430> bracket<00:04:11.090> piece<00:04:11.450> for<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> shock<00:04:12.069> so

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
into that bracket piece for the shock so

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.590 
into that bracket piece for the shock so
just<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.430> give<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.610> an<00:04:13.790> idea<00:04:13.910> how<00:04:14.239> much<00:04:14.420> of

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
just to give you an idea how much of

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.980 
just to give you an idea how much of
that<00:04:14.630> actually<00:04:15.050> got<00:04:15.200> caught<00:04:15.440> off<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.830> there
