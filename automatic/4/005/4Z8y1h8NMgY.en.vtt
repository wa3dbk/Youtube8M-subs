00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello everybody i'm daniele zanieri il 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:12.429
 sleep the chef of the team kitchen 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.480
 astana clear as you can see we are 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.450
 in my kingdom 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.359
 my kingdom where I prepare the dishes 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:25.029
 for the team for the athletes who 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:28.980
 will face the races from the tour de 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:34.570
 france on the lap of italy at the vuelta 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 this as you know the athletes have 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.020
 need a special diet 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:47.579
 and I must be able to feed them in one 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:49.499
 way more than optimal clearly 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.250
 the power supply of a fair is different 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:56.129
 from a person's diet 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.020
 normal working normally what it does 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.570
 a sedentary job 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.930
 which is clearly not an athlete 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.490
 professional from my left 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.250
 we have a kettle where it came from 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.850
 used to cook the athletes pasta 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:21.100
 they eat lots of pasta and lots of rice then 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 they are the fires where I also make vegetables 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 grilling 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.840
 pare cosette 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.550
 here we have a break forum either 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.260
 normal 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.520
 which steamed here is a counter 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.970
 fridge where I store all the products and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.640
 this is all dispensation to my right 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.440
 and to my left dispenses for where 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.440
 we keep supplies 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.220
 this is a bit big lines what 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.320
 is given back to the athletes 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.620
 I greet you and wish you 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.300
 a good continuation and always 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.300
