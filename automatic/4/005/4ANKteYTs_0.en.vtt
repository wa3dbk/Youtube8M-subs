extinguisher he's made by amarak us made

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.259 
extinguisher he's made by amarak us made
high<00:00:12.599> quality<00:00:13.139> stainless<00:00:13.650> steel<00:00:14.210> really<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
high quality stainless steel really a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.030 
high quality stainless steel really a
substantial<00:00:15.450> piece<00:00:16.290> of<00:00:16.470> recording<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.920> you

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
substantial piece of recording that you

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.659 
substantial piece of recording that you
can<00:00:17.160> see<00:00:17.540> and<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:20.070> thing<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.279> makes<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
can see and the thing that makes it

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
can see and the thing that makes it
unique<00:00:24.829> got<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:25.919> do<00:00:26.040> is<00:00:26.340> take<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.790> middle<00:00:27.300> stem

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
unique got to do is take the middle stem

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.220 
unique got to do is take the middle stem
out<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.739> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.750> extinguisher<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.050> has<00:00:31.200> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
out out of the extinguisher it has a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
out out of the extinguisher it has a
knurled<00:00:31.739> knob<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.550> means<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.880> time<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
knurled knob which means it's time that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
knurled knob which means it's time that
like<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.390> texture<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.620> spins<00:00:35.309> by

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
like a texture to it and it spins by

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110 
like a texture to it and it spins by
itself<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> middle<00:00:37.140> being<00:00:38.030> where<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
itself with the middle being where you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640 
itself with the middle being where you
just<00:00:39.300> leave<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.720> so<00:00:40.020> we're<00:00:40.200> really

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
just leave it that way so we're really

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.390 
just leave it that way so we're really
doing<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.750> spending<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> knurled<00:00:43.890> knob

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
doing is just spending that knurled knob

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:57.470 
doing is just spending that knurled knob
off<00:00:52.850> put<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.350> prepackaged<00:00:56.120> Nova<00:00:57.120> cool<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
off put the prepackaged Nova cool in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
off put the prepackaged Nova cool in
there<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> pre-measured<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.650> just<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.040> an

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there a pre-measured it's just about an

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.910 
there a pre-measured it's just about an
ounce<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> fill<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> with

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
ounce and then we need to fill it with

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.510 
ounce and then we need to fill it with
water

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
water

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.330 
water
so<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.150> I've<00:01:09.270> done<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.920> since<00:01:10.920> we're<00:01:11.100> filling

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so what I've done is since we're filling

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
so what I've done is since we're filling
these<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
these all the time is I have a two and a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
these all the time is I have a two and a
half<00:01:13.350> gallon<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.550> two

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
half gallon or it's actually a two

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
half gallon or it's actually a two
gallon<00:01:14.850> bucket<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.659> made<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.440> and<00:01:16.620> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
gallon bucket this is made for two and a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.690 
gallon bucket this is made for two and a
half<00:01:16.680> gallons<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> mean<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.490> say<00:01:17.670> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
half gallons I mean they say that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
half gallons I mean they say that
they're<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.330> fooling<00:01:18.540> around<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.830> get

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
they're not fooling around if you get

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.550 
they're not fooling around if you get
too<00:01:20.130> much<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.020> problems<00:01:22.409> like

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
too much in there you have problems like

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
too much in there you have problems like
with<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.070> water<00:01:23.909> starting<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> come<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.690> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
with the water starting to come out the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
with the water starting to come out the
valve<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> start<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> approach<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
valve when you start to approach the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030 
valve when you start to approach the
amount<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> pressure<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.960> need<00:01:28.140> ok<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
amount of pressure you need ok this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.820 
amount of pressure you need ok this
buckets<00:01:29.640> mark<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.630> gallons<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> just

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
buckets mark the two gallons so I just

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:40.500 
buckets mark the two gallons so I just
went<00:01:32.010> ahead<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.190> filled<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.610> two<00:01:32.820> gallons

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.760 

against<00:01:41.510> mark<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.050> inside<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.470> bucket

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
against mark on the inside of the bucket

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.730 
against mark on the inside of the bucket
already<00:01:43.250> handy<00:01:43.580> but<00:01:44.330> if<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.510> don't<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.290> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
already handy but if you don't have a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.670 
already handy but if you don't have a
bucket<00:01:46.640> like<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.180> hand<00:01:47.450> both<00:01:48.350> people

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
bucket like this on hand both people

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.550 
bucket like this on hand both people
have<00:01:48.830> these<00:01:48.980> like<00:01:49.700> pork<00:01:49.970> containers<00:01:50.560> they're

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
have these like pork containers they're

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.990 
have these like pork containers they're
really<00:01:51.770> cool<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.130> they're<00:01:52.370> all<00:01:52.490> standard

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
really cool because they're all standard

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.300 
really cool because they're all standard
that<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.290> just<00:01:54.440> fell<00:01:54.620> up<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.040> line

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
that if you just fell up to that line

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.990 
that if you just fell up to that line
that's<00:01:55.850> 32<00:01:56.360> ounces<00:01:56.840> if<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.800> take<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.190> 10

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that's 32 ounces if you take that 10

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.240 
that's 32 ounces if you take that 10
times<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.840> gives<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.170> two<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.160> half

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
times that gives you two and a half

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.500 
times that gives you two and a half
gallons<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:02.110> little<00:02:03.110> more<00:02:03.260> tedious<00:02:03.440> but

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
gallons a little more tedious but

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:22.000 
gallons a little more tedious but
certainly<00:02:19.390> clean<00:02:20.390> funnel<00:02:20.900> from<00:02:21.590> our<00:02:21.800> folks

certainly clean funnel from our folks

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.540 
certainly clean funnel from our folks

close to 25 years one nice okay once we
do<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:34.780> since<00:02:35.780> we're<00:02:35.870> already<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.350> the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
truck it's got a little cap that goes

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.100 
truck it's got a little cap that goes
over<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> end<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.220> regular<00:03:43.110> tire

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
over the end just like the regular tire

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.750 
over the end just like the regular tire
check<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:44.920> use<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.489> your<00:03:46.890> tire<00:03:47.890> it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
check that you use on your tire it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.270 
check that you use on your tire it's
just<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.000> quick<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.360> if<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.599> don't<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
just a quick so if you don't have a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680 
just a quick so if you don't have a
compressor<00:03:54.280> at<00:03:54.549> home<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:55.209> know<00:03:55.269> or<00:03:55.390> just<00:03:55.420> take

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
compressor at home you know or just take

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.670 
compressor at home you know or just take
it<00:03:55.810> down<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.140> gas<00:03:56.319> station<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:58.680> hopefully

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
it down to the gas station and hopefully

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.440 
it down to the gas station and hopefully
they'll<00:03:59.890> have<00:03:59.980> enough<00:04:00.220> air<00:04:00.579> pressure<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:01.060> do

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
they'll have enough air pressure to do

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.710 
they'll have enough air pressure to do
100<00:04:01.810> psi<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.730> might<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> look<00:04:04.329> around<00:04:04.420> or

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
100 psi you might have to look around or

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
100 psi you might have to look around or
find<00:04:05.019> any<00:04:05.250> construction<00:04:06.250> buddy

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.530 

you<00:04:09.370> know<00:04:09.520> it's<00:04:09.700> working<00:04:09.910> because<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.390> can

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
you know it's working because you can

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:33.360 
you know it's working because you can
hear<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.470> air<00:04:11.620> going<00:04:11.860> in<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.280> turning<00:04:12.490> up

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.310 

we're<00:04:34.060> coming<00:04:34.300> up<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> green<00:04:34.840> let's<00:04:35.200> see

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
we're coming up to the green let's see

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.280 
we're coming up to the green let's see
here<00:04:38.910> guys<00:04:39.910> make<00:04:40.090> sure<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.690> compressor

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
here guys make sure that the compressor

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.410 
here guys make sure that the compressor
that<00:04:41.410> you're<00:04:41.590> using<00:04:41.860> build<00:04:42.640> up<00:04:42.820> more<00:04:43.210> than<00:04:43.360> a

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
that you're using build up more than a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.270 
that you're using build up more than a
hundred<00:04:43.630> pounds<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.050> pressure<00:04:44.290> because

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
hundred pounds of pressure because

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.810 
hundred pounds of pressure because
that's<00:04:45.490> what<00:04:45.670> this<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.090> unit<00:04:46.960> requires<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:48.700> be

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
that's what this is unit requires to be

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.850 
that's what this is unit requires to be
right<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.390> middle<00:04:49.660> okay<00:04:50.530> then<00:04:50.740> when

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
right in the middle okay then when

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.530 
right in the middle okay then when
you're<00:04:50.980> done<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.970> get<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.210> air<00:04:52.330> pressure

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
you're done and you get the air pressure

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.420 
you're done and you get the air pressure
read<00:04:52.870> one<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.830> just<00:04:53.920> need<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.190> put<00:04:54.310> that

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
read one you just need to put that

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.180 
read one you just need to put that
little<00:04:54.670> cap<00:04:54.820> back<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.270> there<00:04:55.480> just<00:04:55.840> another<00:04:56.190> to

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
little cap back on there just another to

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.720 
little cap back on there just another to
keep<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:59.460> work

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
keep it work

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.100 
keep it work
and<00:05:01.180> then<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.360> take<00:05:01.540> this<00:05:02.220> key<00:05:03.220> here<00:05:03.490> and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
and then you take this key here and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.290 
and then you take this key here and
you're<00:05:05.110> going<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.520> lift<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.670> handle<00:05:07.030> in<00:05:07.120> up

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
you're going to lift the handle in up

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.450 
you're going to lift the handle in up
there<00:05:07.630> go<00:05:07.780> see<00:05:07.960> there's<00:05:08.170> a<00:05:08.290> hole<00:05:09.100> on<00:05:09.340> the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
there go see there's a hole on the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.160 
there go see there's a hole on the
handle<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.810> just<00:05:10.840> run<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.850> through<00:05:12.850> there

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
handle you just run that through there

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.750 
handle you just run that through there
and<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.350> way<00:05:14.470> they<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:14.830> why<00:05:15.040> our<00:05:15.250> deal<00:05:15.460> it

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
and the way they so why our deal it

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.520 
and the way they so why our deal it
seems<00:05:16.420> like<00:05:16.540> it's<00:05:16.690> better<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.110> do<00:05:17.230> it<00:05:17.260> on

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
seems like it's better if you do it on

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.960 
seems like it's better if you do it on
the<00:05:18.930> valve<00:05:19.930> stem<00:05:20.260> side<00:05:20.620> because<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.700> way<00:05:21.820> the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
the valve stem side because the way the

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.500 
the valve stem side because the way the
plastic<00:05:22.390> is<00:05:22.510> it<00:05:23.140> kind<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.380> keeps<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:24.030> going<00:05:25.030> in

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
plastic is it kind of keeps it going in

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.090 
plastic is it kind of keeps it going in
that<00:05:25.660> direction<00:05:25.720> once<00:05:26.350> now<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.770> that's<00:05:26.890> in

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
that direction once now that that's in

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.210 
that direction once now that that's in
there<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.760> can<00:05:27.910> lift<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.570> whole<00:05:29.320> deal<00:05:30.190> and

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
there you can lift the whole deal and

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.880 
there you can lift the whole deal and
you<00:05:30.490> won't<00:05:30.670> be<00:05:30.790> able<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:32.040> accidentally<00:05:34.890> fire
