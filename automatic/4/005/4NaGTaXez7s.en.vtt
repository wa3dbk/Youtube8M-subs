00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.000
 to make burritos our way I'll 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.530
 to need Mexican tortillas an envelope 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.139
 That area of ​​Dore de Burrito is a glass of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.250
 water oil 200 grams of cheese 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.779
 semi-cured 500 grams of minced meat 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.849
 tomato and lettuce as we are going to 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.970
 make the recipe for two people we have 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.610
 taken half of the ingredients that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.560
 we have said a half amount if 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.779
 take the measurements as we have 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.480
 said would be about 10 burritos for some 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.050
 four people in a pan we throw a 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.050
 jet of oil 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 and the minced meat 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.950
 and make it over medium heat until the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.260
 living flesh being golden when the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.379
 meat is golden, we throw a glass of 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.379
 Water 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.550
 and the starter nador 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.110
 we mix everything well 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.790
 and wait until it breaks to boil 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 when it breaks to boil, we will lower the fire 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.909
 and let it simmer 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.130
 for 15 minutes 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 meanwhile we will heat the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.460
 microwave wheat tortillas and 15 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.579
 seconds as you see the result is a 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.429
 slightly thicker if it's too salty 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.819
 for your pleasure you can throw another 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.609
 little more water once ready we will throw 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.620
 in the center with a thickness of about two 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.550
 fingers 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.920
 the sofrito 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.920
 we will throw over a bit of cheese 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.440
 and then we will add a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.940
 teaspoon minced tomato in cubes 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.940
 and a little lettuce 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 once ready, it is only necessary to close it in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.920
 pancake shape if we load it too 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.820
 it is likely to be more difficult for us 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.820
 close it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 and this is the result of our 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.850
 Burrito
