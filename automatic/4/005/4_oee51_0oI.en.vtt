00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
purchase which I guess in a way it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060 
purchase which I guess in a way it's
sort<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.150> unlocking<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.650> let's<00:01:31.829> build

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sort of like unlocking it so let's build

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
sort of like unlocking it so let's build
a<00:01:32.159> bank<00:01:32.600> because<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.840> we're

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a bank because that's what we're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.890 
a bank because that's what we're
supposed<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> very

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
supposed to do and this is very

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
supposed to do and this is very
primitive<00:01:36.900> stuff<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.470> now<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.860> up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
primitive stuff right now it's our up

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160 
primitive stuff right now it's our up
the<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:39.270> beginning<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:39.990> much

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the very very very beginning pretty much

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.480 
the very very very beginning pretty much
so<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> looks<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.040> spot<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so that looks like a good spot for the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
so that looks like a good spot for the
bank<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.479> they<00:01:45.479> start

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
bank and put it there and they start

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
construction on the bank it's just a big

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359

his<00:05:22.500> brother<00:05:22.830> so<00:05:23.790> any<00:05:24.180> pretty<00:05:24.990> much<00:05:25.110> any<00:05:25.350> video

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
his brother so any pretty much any video

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.179 

at<00:05:37.689> this<00:05:37.809> point<00:05:38.020> we're<00:05:38.199> launch<00:05:38.649> for<00:05:38.919> trying<00:05:39.129> to

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
at this point we're launch for trying to

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.709 
at this point we're launch for trying to
find<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.610> army<00:05:39.939> men<00:05:40.119> and<00:05:40.389> then<00:05:40.599> we're

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
throwing them down to the phone and

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.969 
throwing them down to the phone and
