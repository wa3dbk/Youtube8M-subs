00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
in my camera I record a video I transfer

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:47.870 
in my camera I record a video I transfer
to<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.399> computer

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to a computer

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.069 
to a computer
I'm<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.270> show<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.600> how<00:01:48.689> fast<00:01:48.899> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I'm gonna show just how fast that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
I'm gonna show just how fast that
process<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.979> I'll<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.460> ahead<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> show<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
process is and I'll go ahead and show a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.690 
process is and I'll go ahead and show a
little<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.810> test<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:53.009> fast<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.520> goes

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
little you know test of how fast it goes

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
little you know test of how fast it goes
from<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.780> computer<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.649> card<00:01:56.009> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
from your computer to the card so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.740 
from your computer to the card so
technically<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.360> camera

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
technically that could be your camera

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
technically that could be your camera
that's<00:01:58.140> recording<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> footage<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.430> how

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that's recording the footage and see how

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.280 
that's recording the footage and see how
just<00:01:59.909> how<00:01:59.969> fast<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.390> goes<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:01.170> these

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
just how fast that goes because these

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.520 
just how fast that goes because these
are<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.500> through<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.630> theoretical<00:02:03.630> output

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
are just through the theoretical output

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.029 
are just through the theoretical output
and<00:02:04.770> input<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.820> card<00:02:06.090> supports<00:02:07.039> hold

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and input that this card supports hold

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
and input that this card supports hold
up<00:02:08.190> hold<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.489> hold<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.819> hold<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.179> hold<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.599> okay

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
up hold up hold up hold up hold up okay

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.960 
up hold up hold up hold up hold up okay
so<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.379> transferring<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> footage<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.849> my

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so I'm transferring the footage to my

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280 
so I'm transferring the footage to my
computer<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.660> my<00:02:12.840> Noor

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

SD<00:02:13.620> card<00:02:13.829> that<00:02:13.950> I've<00:02:14.040> been<00:02:14.129> using<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
SD card that I've been using for a

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.130 
SD card that I've been using for a
couple<00:02:14.670> years<00:02:14.849> now<00:02:14.909> at<00:02:15.150> 82<00:02:15.450> megabytes<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
couple years now at 82 megabytes a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
couple years now at 82 megabytes a
second<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.159> speed<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.519> get<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.939> I'm

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
second that's the speed I get and I'm

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.539 
second that's the speed I get and I'm
happy<00:02:18.299> with<00:02:18.329> those<00:02:18.569> speeds<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.459> tested<00:02:20.459> this

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
happy with those speeds I tested this

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.330 
happy with those speeds I tested this
out<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.079> transferred<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.109> video<00:02:22.439> to<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.010> SD

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
out I transferred the video to the SD

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.390 
out I transferred the video to the SD
card<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.939> it<00:02:24.420> went<00:02:24.659> at<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> very<00:02:25.500> nice<00:02:25.709> speed<00:02:26.099> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
card and it went at a very nice speed it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.819 
card and it went at a very nice speed it
took<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little<00:02:27.359> bit<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.019> wind<00:02:28.560> up

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
took a little bit for it to like wind up

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.220 
took a little bit for it to like wind up
and<00:02:29.189> get<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> speed<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.930> speed

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and get to the speed but the right speed

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.020 
and get to the speed but the right speed
was<00:02:31.349> 82<00:02:31.920> megabytes<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.489> second<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:32.909> you're

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
was 82 megabytes a second as you're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.750 
was 82 megabytes a second as you're
gonna<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.239> right<00:02:33.629> now<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.129> went<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.220> take<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
gonna see right now I went to take that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.229 
gonna see right now I went to take that
video<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.689> move<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.530> from<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.609> card<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
video and move it from the card to the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.179 
video and move it from the card to the
computer<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.139> happened<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.560> fast<00:02:40.709> I

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
computer and it happened so fast I

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.709 
computer and it happened so fast I
thought<00:02:41.220> okay<00:02:42.000> something<00:02:42.329> isn't<00:02:42.569> right<00:02:42.599> here

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
thought okay something isn't right here

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.119 
thought okay something isn't right here
something<00:02:43.620> isn't<00:02:43.920> right

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
something isn't right

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.000 
something isn't right
had<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.700> take<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.879> bigger<00:02:45.239> video<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:46.769> like

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
had to take a bigger video that was like

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.240 
had to take a bigger video that was like
three<00:02:47.909> or<00:02:48.000> four<00:02:48.030> gigs<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.870> transfer<00:02:49.799> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
three or four gigs and transfer that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.729 
three or four gigs and transfer that
from<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> card<00:02:51.419> to<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.659> computer<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.379> even

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
from the card to the computer to even

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.830 
from the card to the computer to even
get<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.889> screen<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.639> pop<00:02:53.849> up<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.510> said<00:02:54.720> how

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
get a screen to pop up that said how

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
get a screen to pop up that said how
fast<00:02:55.139> it<00:02:55.349> was<00:02:55.409> transferring<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.669> was

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
fast it was transferring and it was

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.879 
fast it was transferring and it was
transferring<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.540> fast<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.530> couldn't

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
transferring so fast that I couldn't

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.580 
transferring so fast that I couldn't
even<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.609> actual<00:02:59.909> speed<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.599> took<00:03:01.379> me

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
even see the actual speed it took me

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.979 
even see the actual speed it took me
like<00:03:02.069> at<00:03:02.340> least<00:03:02.549> nine<00:03:02.939> times<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.540> deleting<00:03:03.900> the
