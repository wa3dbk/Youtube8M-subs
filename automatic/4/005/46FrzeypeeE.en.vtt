thing<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.590> remember<00:01:16.890> how<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.039> pointed<00:01:17.340> out

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
thing was remember how I pointed out

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.560 
thing was remember how I pointed out
there<00:01:17.549> were<00:01:17.609> only<00:01:17.670> four<00:01:17.939> fasteners<00:01:18.299> per

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
there were only four fasteners per

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.139 
there were only four fasteners per
driver<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:19.079> on<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.829> this<00:01:20.009> driver<00:01:20.280> two

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
driver well on this on this driver two

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.779 
driver well on this on this driver two
of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.329> t-nuts<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.899> back<00:01:22.049> came<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.789> which

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
of the t-nuts in the back came out which

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.940 
of the t-nuts in the back came out which
is<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.689> problem<00:01:25.109> because<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.799> means

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
is that's a problem because that means

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
is that's a problem because that means
when<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.249> put<00:01:26.399> this<00:01:26.490> driver<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.969> in<00:01:27.179> you're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
when you put this driver back in you're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
when you put this driver back in you're
only<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.929> have<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.259> bolts<00:01:28.530> holding<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
only gonna have two bolts holding it in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.819 
only gonna have two bolts holding it in
so<00:01:29.369> good<00:01:30.329> luck<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.590> want<00:01:31.770> to

you should be able to see what's going
on<00:01:34.289> inside<00:01:34.469> because<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.399> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.609> see<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
on inside because now you can see the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.399 
on inside because now you can see the
interior<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> cab<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.749> here's<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
interior of the cab and here's what we

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
interior of the cab and here's what we
learned<00:01:37.649> we<00:01:37.859> learned<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.399> baffle<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
learned we learned that the baffle is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.840 
learned we learned that the baffle is
plywood<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.450> everything<00:01:39.749> else<00:01:39.899> is<00:01:40.020> MDF<00:01:40.850> as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
plywood but everything else is MDF as

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760 
plywood but everything else is MDF as
you<00:01:41.969> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.840> you'll

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you can see all that in there you'll

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.959 
you can see all that in there you'll
notice<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.999> really<00:01:45.899> primitive<00:01:46.969> cleats

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
notice they just really primitive cleats

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.219 
notice they just really primitive cleats
and<00:01:48.210> everything<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.079> there

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and everything that's going on in there

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
and everything that's going on in there
then<00:01:49.829> there's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.069> brace<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> back

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
then there's a brace there in the back

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
then there's a brace there in the back
that<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.929> can<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.399> CNC

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that you can kind of see that's all CNC

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.289 
that you can kind of see that's all CNC
routed<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> MDF<00:01:55.969> everything<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> cab

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
routed out of MDF everything in the cab

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
routed out of MDF everything in the cab
world<00:01:57.539> these<00:01:57.719> days<00:01:57.780> almost<00:01:58.200> everything<00:01:58.649> has

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
world these days almost everything has

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.629 
world these days almost everything has
made<00:01:58.889> on<00:01:59.310> CNC<00:01:59.850> machines<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> what's<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
made on CNC machines so what's the

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.550 
made on CNC machines so what's the
problem<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:02.969> MDF<00:02:03.359> well<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> problem<00:02:04.139> is<00:02:04.289> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
problem with MDF well the problem is a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709 
problem with MDF well the problem is a
couple<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.670> first<00:02:05.880> off<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.389> really<00:02:06.450> not

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
couple things first off it's really not

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.249 
couple things first off it's really not
all<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.899> strong<00:02:07.640> MDF<00:02:08.929> while<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.110> very

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
all that strong MDF while it's very

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.760 
all that strong MDF while it's very
dense<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.740> very<00:02:10.860> hard<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
dense and very hard and actually it's a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
dense and very hard and actually it's a
really<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.070> material<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.640> building<00:02:14.730> homes

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
really good material for building homes

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.210 
really good material for building homes
because<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.990> sucks<00:02:16.380> up<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> lot<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.800> acoustical

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
because it sucks up a lot of acoustical

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.000 
because it sucks up a lot of acoustical
vibration<00:02:17.730> MDF<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.530> very<00:02:19.770> strong

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
vibration MDF just it's not very strong

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
vibration MDF just it's not very strong
at<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.430> when<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.640> flex<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.240> it'll<00:02:21.810> crack

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
at all so when you flex it it'll crack

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.780 
at all so when you flex it it'll crack
the<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.340> bad<00:02:23.820> about<00:02:23.880> MDF<00:02:24.510> is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the other thing that's bad about MDF is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.750 
the other thing that's bad about MDF is
if<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> wet<00:02:27.330> it'll<00:02:27.630> saturate<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.760> when

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
if you get it wet it'll saturate so when

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000 
if you get it wet it'll saturate so when
MDF<00:02:30.180> gets<00:02:30.420> wet<00:02:30.660> man<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.080> expands<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
MDF gets wet man it just expands and it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.770 
MDF gets wet man it just expands and it
just<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.370> plays<00:02:33.180> heck<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
just it plays heck with it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.970 
just it plays heck with it
the<00:02:33.960> third<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.320> that's<00:02:34.500> really<00:02:34.590> bad<00:02:34.800> about

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the third thing that's really bad about

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.210 
the third thing that's really bad about
MDF<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.640> weight<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.150> about<00:02:36.480> 30%<00:02:37.260> heavier

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
MDF is the weight it's about 30% heavier

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.540 
MDF is the weight it's about 30% heavier
than<00:02:38.880> plywood<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.870> far<00:02:40.260> less

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
than plywood and it's far less

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
than plywood and it's far less
structurally<00:02:41.550> strong<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:43.140> from<00:02:43.320> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
structurally strong so really from up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500 
structurally strong so really from up
for<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> home<00:02:44.400> audio<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> thing<00:02:45.240> it's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
for a home audio kind of thing it's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.970 
for a home audio kind of thing it's
wonderful<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.320> some<00:02:46.500> great<00:02:46.680> shapes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
wonderful you can do some great shapes

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
wonderful you can do some great shapes
where<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.310> really<00:02:47.820> routs<00:02:48.060> well<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.720> see

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
where they really routs well really see

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.860 
where they really routs well really see
and<00:02:49.020> see<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> machines<00:02:49.560> well<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:50.310> for

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
and see the machines well but for

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.940 
and see the machines well but for
musical<00:02:51.870> instrument<00:02:52.200> speakers<00:02:52.500> speakers<00:02:52.860> are

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
musical instrument speakers speakers are

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.710 
musical instrument speakers speakers are
going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> take<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> lot<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.430> abuse<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.030> just

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
going to take a lot of abuse you just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.790 
going to take a lot of abuse you just
you<00:02:54.870> would<00:02:55.020> never<00:02:55.170> want<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.440> use<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
you would never want to use it and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.860 
you would never want to use it and
that's<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.490> number<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.180> reason<00:02:57.720> why

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that's that is the number one reason why

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.840 
that's that is the number one reason why
this<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.500> not<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:58.950> would<00:02:59.070> be<00:02:59.190> called<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.640> you
