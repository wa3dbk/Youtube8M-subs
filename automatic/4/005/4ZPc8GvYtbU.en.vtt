a very good posture when you're

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.200 
a very good posture when you're
cornering<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.799> new<00:01:19.920> 575<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.850> been<00:01:21.000> built

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cornering the new 575 has been built

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.200 
cornering the new 575 has been built
around<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> 27<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> half<00:01:22.530> inch<00:01:22.770> wheel<00:01:23.210> or

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
around the 27 and a half inch wheel or

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
650b

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
650b
and<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.510> takes<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.870> lot<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> trace<00:01:28.740> we've

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and so it takes a lot of the trace we've

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.320 
and so it takes a lot of the trace we've
always<00:01:29.100> had<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.520> 575<00:01:30.270> we've<00:01:31.020> tweaked<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
always had the 575 we've tweaked the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.880 
always had the 575 we've tweaked the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that go better the harder you push it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.150 
that go better the harder you push it
the<00:01:58.680> 575<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.300> sub<00:02:00.600> six<00:02:00.899> inches<00:02:01.289> but<00:02:02.009> it's
