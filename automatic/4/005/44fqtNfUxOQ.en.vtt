proportion and number and how that was
used<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.549> design<00:01:00.049> in<00:01:01.049> earlier<00:01:01.470> time<00:01:01.769> we've

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
used in design in earlier time we've

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.979 
used in design in earlier time we've
been<00:01:02.460> working<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.030> mornings<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.839> then

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
been working in the mornings but then

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
been working in the mornings but then
having<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> rest<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> day<00:01:05.070> free<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
having the rest of the day free the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
having the rest of the day free the
afternoons<00:01:07.320> people<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> continue<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.369> work<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
afternoons people can continue to work I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
afternoons people can continue to work I
think<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.390> people<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.869> benefit<00:01:10.650> from

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
think the way people can benefit from

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.270 
think the way people can benefit from
coming<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.450> conference<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:13.280> first

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

calligraphers<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.360> we've<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.720> people<00:01:24.900> who

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
calligraphers and we've got people who

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
calligraphers and we've got people who
are<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> beginning<00:01:26.130> of
