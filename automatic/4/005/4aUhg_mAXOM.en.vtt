00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.750
 Wessels is also that we know all the killers but at least in the spirit Beisicht 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.500
 allowed to the great Eintracht fans assured themselves knew Andrea 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.740
 Petkovic Germany's best tennis players have last 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 Weekend Attention 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.739
 including other places 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.579
 The simplest of the three consoles had 2002 outside and percent is for 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.530
 that he is sad 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.100
 But we are very happy that we are now connected ladies and 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 Gentlemen and was 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.069
 in Stuttgart where she met her last weekend 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.659
 with the crime Schopp team actually wants to leap into the 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.530
 World top has managed by a 5 0 against Cologne Americans 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.200
 and tomorrow she is already one fifth more 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.230
 and welcome to the Porsche Karten Stuttgart Asthma Andrea 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 Petkovic Castle here and now to follow 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.700
 but they have this success 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.240
 a by crew 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.370
 or from the walk with just doing it with work they will experience that in them 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.330
 Of course, it does not hit the spot right away, but then it gets over as well as the whole thing 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.420
 has expired 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 how do you just want the rest of the season? 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 So I am absolutely convinced that we stay in the first division and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.530
 becomes 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 then it is finally in the Champions League play b the first athletes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 are always a bit optimistic 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.549
 Hertha was 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.680
 that will be so it's under pressure or that's all right so think positive 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.560
 we only had positive singer negative thinking 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 So Hegemon Semester offers something special 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.810
 yes what should have come of it is in Stuttgart was a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.220
 great success we look again in a post by Philipp 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 Hofmeister the course of the weekend for the German tennis ladies 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.310
 this one is currently injured 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.960
 Andrea Petkovic is the new front woman, the German women's tennis is us 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.000
 Look that ensures attention 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 the rackets 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 for arguments 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.009
 Talent to the world class player 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.119
 Driven by Petrovic, the German fed-cup team manages the yesterday 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.119
 Return to the World League 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.529
 the dead German ladies tennis 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.879
 it lies again 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.809
 thanks to Power Forward to Reach 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.569
 that has matured 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 along with hard work without a lot of fun 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.029
 with the advent Petko hype anyway 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.389
 the rising pressure 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
 sees her as a challenge 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.740
 Andrea Petkovic saves learned purpose 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.049
 Force to read 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.170
 she unites 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.669
 the virtues of a coming superstar 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.489
 an irrepressible will 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.340
 combined 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.659
 with play joke 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 and 20 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.099
 if Germany rejoices again 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.429
 thanks front woman 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.429
 Andrea Petkovic 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.029
 the current researchers write and say they are the leader in German 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.129
 Women's tennis has become more pressure or even a bit far 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.340
 Of course it's a great honor, but I feel the pressure 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.360
 I feel DEG's heightened expectations 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.160
 especially now back in Germany when I was abroad 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.939
 I do not get it that way 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.779
 but here, of course, the audience wants to see the performance of the 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.089
 you only belonged here so far and 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.879
 I feel that but so far everything is fine 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.419
 we are happy to hear that 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.639
 and you know you read that you too are currently from all sides 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.799
 besieged with media called us questions so thank you again 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.209
 Today, between the two, they were both excited about their son 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 At the end of the game you can add content to the content, how much 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.209
 Inquiries have a day like many interviews they could give 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.009
 So today I've already been holding press events for two hours 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.330
 and then another hour 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.300
 With the Red, this is welcomed by sponsors and simply with the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.120
 People's speech 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.199
 that was just the day on that which is a bit quieter there I have 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.280
 still managed his half-hour tact weakening and training 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.569
 The first days are really exhausting. I am from an appointment to 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.490
 rushed next and I think that one has also seen me that someone 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.930
 but now lived 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.749
 I'm a bit tired 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.639
 on the one hand, of course, I have to 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.229
 Ditzen grow in that should now more 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.460
 become the constant thing and 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.789
 I just like to deal with that and the steady Lendl always stays in one 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:57.620
 little time 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.629
 Thank you very much for listening 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.629
 Bierhoff 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.859
 We both think that at this point I say a few years ago 

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:11.229
 talk about that she would like to change the front line sometimes 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.789
 would like to stand on the other side of the camera 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.319
 Percent, if they agree we can send a shipment at the end of the year 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.210
 Moderating them together would make it easier for guests to do so 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.930
 Percent interview yes the bullying 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.069
 the Wemdinger reported once is okay 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.830
 the entire crew 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.550
 the entire crew 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.009
 okay I have to get points again 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.240
 in Bochum deny but that gladly take on me already gets downright 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.770
 Said everything clear we make so the complete passion is then a guest 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.780
 Before I am entertaining broadcast I am not always sure the 511 back to 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.339
 I do not want to say serious about life, but you have 4 good six months 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.469
 once said that she is more than an entertainer as an athlete 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.729
 even 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.729
 this has already changed quite a bit 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.749
 So I always said that I am first and foremost an athlete 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.480
 but also as an entertainer 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.800
 because it's like that people come for something 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.819
 commanded to get the want 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:03.990
 to chat 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.680
 and they want to feel emotions and that's why I'm always trying 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.789
 always been someone on the course who was very emotional 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.090
 and sometimes you could share your feelings in the audience 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.720
 in 13 are ducks sometimes in the laughter all sorts of things and me 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.740
 think that 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.699
 that's what people want to see because that's why it's about sports and 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.139
 great emotions and tries i always go to valley with the people sometimes 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.810
 Of course, it's more difficult because moments that are not so nice are on 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.350
 and then the whole world expects but I believe in the big and 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.040
 all 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.180
 to make people complain and sympathize 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.789
 Of course we would like to have some nice moments in the coming week 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.550
 Experiencing them Stuttgart are 13 of the top 20 tennis players at the start 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.689
 what do you have 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.789
 for an idea what can you achieve 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.900
 this has always been me for ages 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.410
 Being in one of the best places to kidney it's just super organized 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.319
 and 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.830
 So it is really everything for the player so that's why the best 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.180
 the world and I believe what is very important to me now is easy 

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:04.279
 to get used to this new situation this new attention 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.480
 call the little Mini Hypatia 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.610
 and so really learns to survive under this pressure and from the local audience 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.900
 to retrieve my performance 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.250
 and unfortunately we only try this one increasingly German country since Werner 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.710
 and to enjoy every moment of it as best I can 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.980
 Unfortunately, it is only one week that I spend a year at home in front of one 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:23.139
 Audience can play 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.819
 then we wish you that you can enjoy this week maybe with 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.740
 could become the largest possible 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.330
 DAPD 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
 ca 

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:39.639
 Halver wants the broadcast in December, so he'll have to get it in time 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.159
 The Christmas party was what's happening in our studio
