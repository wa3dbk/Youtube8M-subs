this<00:01:40.710> portal<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> need<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:43.100> throw

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
this portal what you need to do is throw

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
this portal what you need to do is throw
down<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> dust<00:01:45.450> while<00:01:45.780> you're<00:01:45.930> inside

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
down a bit of dust while you're inside

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
down a bit of dust while you're inside
the<00:01:46.530> portal<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.670> teleport<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the portal and will teleport you to a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
the portal and will teleport you to a
post<00:01:48.600> binding<00:01:48.869> location<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
post binding location that you can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
post binding location that you can
customize<00:01:50.420> over<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.689> I'll<00:01:51.899> quickly<00:01:52.079> show

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
customize over there I'll quickly show

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.139 
customize over there I'll quickly show
you<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.610> four<00:01:53.880> command

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you right now one of these four command

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.139 
you right now one of these four command
blocks<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.899> basically<00:01:55.560> teleport<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
blocks will basically teleport you to a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.609 
blocks will basically teleport you to a
corresponding<00:01:57.689> location<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.500> have

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
corresponding location so you just have

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.819 
corresponding location so you just have
to<00:01:58.710> change<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> coordinates<00:01:59.909> over<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
to change the coordinates over here and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.380 
to change the coordinates over here and
I've<00:02:01.829> labeled<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.969> which<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I've labeled it so you know which one is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
I've labeled it so you know which one is
which<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.409> quickly<00:02:04.619> start<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.009> with

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
which some are quickly start off with

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.660 
which some are quickly start off with
the<00:02:05.369> glowstone<00:02:05.820> dust<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.290> walk<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.799> alright

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the glowstone dust and I walk in alright

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.859 
the glowstone dust and I walk in alright
just<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> throw<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.239> glowstone<00:02:09.509> dust<00:02:09.569> down

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
just up to throw two glowstone dust down

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.310 
just up to throw two glowstone dust down
and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:10.920> animation<00:02:11.190> going

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
and you get a bit of an animation going

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.950 
and you get a bit of an animation going
so<00:02:13.320> that's<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:13.800> happens<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.750> basically<00:02:15.750> you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so that's what happens and basically you

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.030 
so that's what happens and basically you
get<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> hold<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> corresponding

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
get to hold it to the corresponding

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.500 
get to hold it to the corresponding
location<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:19.010> I've<00:02:20.010> done<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.970> cave

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
location and I've done it here in cave

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.900 
location and I've done it here in cave
and<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.770> great<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.820> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and the great thing about this is you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.430 
and the great thing about this is you
can<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.120> multiple<00:02:24.420> portals<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.290> don't

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
can have multiple portals so you don't

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.530 
can have multiple portals so you don't
have<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.770> destroy<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.100> one

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
have to destroy that one

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.720 
have to destroy that one
and<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:28.290> happens<00:02:28.680> get<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> bit<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.670> an

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
and this happens get a bit of an

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.970 
and this happens get a bit of an
elimination<00:02:30.210> again<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:31.320> love<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> yes

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
elimination again I really love it yes

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.910 
elimination again I really love it yes
because<00:02:32.910> fire<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.540> all<00:02:33.840> about<00:02:34.080> Phoenix<00:02:34.650> isn't

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because fire is all about Phoenix isn't

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
because fire is all about Phoenix isn't
Phoenix's<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.760> fire<00:02:35.940> alright<00:02:36.600> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
Phoenix's are all that fire alright and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.590 
Phoenix's are all that fire alright and
so<00:02:37.830> you'd<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.190> walk<00:02:38.280> straight<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.970> I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
so you'd have to walk straight in and I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.570 
so you'd have to walk straight in and I
have<00:02:39.750> made<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.380> redstone<00:02:40.800> dust<00:02:40.950> teleport

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
have made this redstone dust teleport

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580 
have made this redstone dust teleport
myself<00:02:41.670> back<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> Redstone<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.380> course

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
myself back to the Redstone of course

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.930 
myself back to the Redstone of course
you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.800> all<00:02:43.890> change<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.580> always<00:02:44.700> change

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you can all change you can always change

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.260 
you can all change you can always change
these<00:02:45.710> coordinates<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.850> these<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.180> just

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
these coordinates and but these are just

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.690 
these coordinates and but these are just
the<00:02:48.360> ones<00:02:48.480> I've<00:02:48.660> done<00:02:48.860> alright<00:02:49.860> another<00:02:50.460> thing

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the ones I've done alright another thing

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.490 
the ones I've done alright another thing
I<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> show<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.170> spawn<00:02:52.470> a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
I like to show you is if I spawn a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
I like to show you is if I spawn a
second<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.920> these<00:02:56.070> will<00:02:56.370> just

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
second one one of these will just

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.140 
second one one of these will just
disappear

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
disappear

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.380 
disappear
so<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:58.350> portal<00:02:58.770> will<00:02:58.890> know<00:02:59.070> which<00:02:59.940> portal<00:03:00.300> is

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
so the portal will know which portal is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.810 
so the portal will know which portal is
closer<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.770> I'm<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.700> now

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
closer to you so if I'm right now

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.700 
closer to you so if I'm right now
currently<00:03:03.180> above<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.900> grass<00:03:04.110> block<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.530> I'm

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
currently above this grass block so I'm

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.170 
currently above this grass block so I'm
closer<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.160> one<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.940> go<00:03:06.000> over<00:03:06.120> here

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
closer to that one if we go over here

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.320 
closer to that one if we go over here
this<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.720> appears<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.800> pretty<00:03:07.920> nice

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
this one appears so it's pretty nice

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.140 
this one appears so it's pretty nice
reduces<00:03:09.330> lag<00:03:09.570> obviously<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:12.060> are

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
reduces lag obviously because there are

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.910 
reduces lag obviously because there are
a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.390> particles<00:03:12.780> involved<00:03:13.020> here<00:03:13.230> let's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
a lot of particles involved here let's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.260 
a lot of particles involved here let's
see<00:03:14.100> yeah<00:03:14.520> eight<00:03:14.700> thousand<00:03:15.060> particles

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
see yeah eight thousand particles

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.680 
see yeah eight thousand particles
obviously<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> lot<00:03:16.550> this<00:03:17.550> if<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.510> right-click

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
obviously a lot this if you right-click

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.600 
obviously a lot this if you right-click
this<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.320> will<00:03:19.410> destroy<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.920> nearby<00:03:20.130> portal

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
this one it will destroy a nearby portal

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.490 
this one it will destroy a nearby portal
and<00:03:20.780> multiple<00:03:21.780> portals<00:03:22.020> would<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.290> close<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
and multiple portals would be close to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
and multiple portals would be close to
several<00:03:22.830> them<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.700> one<00:03:23.850> will<00:03:24.000> purge<00:03:24.240> all<00:03:24.570> of

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
several them this one will purge all of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.110 
several them this one will purge all of
them<00:03:24.810> from<00:03:25.020> your<00:03:25.110> world<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:26.100> course<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
particles stuff like that there's a lot

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.380 
particles stuff like that there's a lot
of<00:03:47.280> wrestling<00:03:47.550> involved<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.180> not<00:03:48.240> going

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
of wrestling involved but I'm not going

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.030 
of wrestling involved but I'm not going
to<00:03:48.420> go<00:03:48.510> through<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.500> import<00:03:49.890> this

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to go through it so you can import this

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.550 
to go through it so you can import this
into<00:03:50.100> your<00:03:50.370> world<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.840> only<00:03:52.020> problem<00:03:52.410> with<00:03:52.500> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
into your world the only problem with it

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280 
into your world the only problem with it
is<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.700> very<00:03:53.730> heavy<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.450> servers<00:03:54.870> sometimes

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
is it is very heavy on servers sometimes

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.100 
is it is very heavy on servers sometimes
and<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.450> read<00:03:57.600> these<00:03:57.690> signs<00:03:57.870> for

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
and you can read these signs for

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.550 
and you can read these signs for
yourself<00:03:59.209> just<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.300> make<00:04:00.570> sure<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.990> have<00:04:01.200> yeah
