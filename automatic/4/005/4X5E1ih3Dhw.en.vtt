going<00:00:18.420> too<00:00:18.570> fast<00:00:19.070> make<00:00:20.070> sure<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.730> back<00:00:21.269> foot

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
going too fast make sure your back foot

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.839 
going too fast make sure your back foot
is<00:00:21.810> square<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> tail<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.609> front

foot is hanging off the nose just a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.120 
foot is hanging off the nose just a
little<00:00:25.740> bit<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> catch<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.029> hook

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
little bit for the catch of the hook

little bit for the catch of the hook
what<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.119> pop<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> regular

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
what you do is you pop like a regular

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.230 
what you do is you pop like a regular
nose<00:00:31.259> hook<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.220> wait<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.790> momentum

to<00:00:33.390> come<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> stop<00:00:33.960> before<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.470> go<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.830> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to come to a stop before you go for the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.330 
to come to a stop before you go for the
frontside<00:00:35.370> pivot<00:00:36.680> what<00:00:37.680> should<00:00:37.920> happen<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
frontside pivot what should happen is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
frontside pivot what should happen is
you<00:00:38.460> should<00:00:38.640> end<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.719> stationary

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you should end up in a little stationary

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
unlike a regular nose hook impossible

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.630 
unlike a regular nose hook impossible
the<00:00:45.270> backside<00:00:45.660> version<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.219> start<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the backside version which you start the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
the backside version which you start the
pivot<00:00:47.969> immediately<00:00:48.780> after<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.320> front<00:00:49.590> foot

comes<00:00:50.070> off<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> hook<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> once<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> have

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
comes off for the hook so once you have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.459 
comes off for the hook so once you have
control<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> board<00:00:53.670> from<00:00:54.320> what<00:00:55.320> we'll

call a fakie nose hook position you
swing<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> board<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.129> 180<00:00:59.789> degrees<00:00:59.879> until

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
swing the board around 180 degrees until

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
swing the board around 180 degrees until
you're<00:01:00.989> facing<00:01:01.230> forward<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.070> regular

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you're facing forward in your regular

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.119 
you're facing forward in your regular
stance<00:01:02.960> now<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.710> tricky<00:01:04.830> part

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
stance now this is the tricky part

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.470 
stance now this is the tricky part
because<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.670> helps<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> lean<00:01:06.120> back<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> little

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
because it helps to lean back a little

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.620 
because it helps to lean back a little
bit<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.330> too<00:01:09.450> fast

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bit for this if you're going too fast

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.110 
bit for this if you're going too fast
you'll<00:01:09.930> slide<00:01:10.230> too<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.520> you'll<00:01:11.880> most

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
you'll slide too much and you'll most

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.480 
you'll slide too much and you'll most
likely<00:01:12.210> lose<00:01:12.570> control<00:01:13.020> too<00:01:13.920> slow<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
likely lose control too slow and you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
likely lose control too slow and you
won't<00:01:14.640> generate<00:01:14.970> enough<00:01:15.360> energy<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
won't generate enough energy for the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.060 
won't generate enough energy for the
rotation<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> regular<00:01:19.920> notebook

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
rotation so from a regular notebook

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
rotation so from a regular notebook
impossible<00:01:20.790> position<00:01:21.110> facing<00:01:22.110> forward<00:01:22.620> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
impossible position facing forward you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.250 
impossible position facing forward you
just<00:01:22.980> explode<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.120> biggest<00:01:24.540> no<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.200> if

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
just explode into the biggest no so if

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.620 
just explode into the biggest no so if
you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:25.920> try<00:01:26.730> to<00:01:26.790> jump<00:01:27.120> forward<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.480> little

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you can and try to jump forward a little

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
you can and try to jump forward a little
bit<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.230> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.070> propels<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
bit because this is what propels you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
bit because this is what propels you
into<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.880> role<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:31.080> completes<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> trick<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
into a role which completes the trick so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.230 
into a role which completes the trick so
in<00:01:33.210> steps<00:01:33.660> it's<00:01:34.050> pop<00:01:35.120> catch<00:01:36.800> pivot<00:01:38.240> explode

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
in steps it's pop catch pivot explode

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
in steps it's pop catch pivot explode
forward<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.620> land<00:01:40.830> clean<00:01:41.870> oftentimes<00:01:42.870> I

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
forward and the land clean oftentimes I

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.080 
forward and the land clean oftentimes I
will<00:01:43.440> land<00:01:43.650> with<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:44.130> feet<00:01:44.370> neither<00:01:44.670> too<00:01:44.850> close

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.200 
will land with my feet neither too close
together<00:01:45.300> or<00:01:45.810> too<00:01:46.200> far<00:01:46.410> forward<00:01:47.060> which<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
together or too far forward which is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.150 
together or too far forward which is
just<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> typical<00:01:48.840> problem<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.650> impossible

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
just a typical problem with impossible

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.630 
just a typical problem with impossible
tricks<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.680> fun<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> try<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.370> one

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
tricks it's really fun to try this one

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
tricks it's really fun to try this one
at<00:01:53.760> high<00:01:53.880> speeds<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.960> crazy

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
at high speeds because you can get crazy
