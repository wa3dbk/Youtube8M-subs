he finds it it's just all pretty
standard<00:01:55.680> trap<00:01:56.680> much<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.950> his<00:01:57.040> mind<00:01:57.220> except

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
standard trap much to his mind except

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.250 
standard trap much to his mind except
his<00:01:57.760> gases<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.330> little<00:01:58.600> bit<00:01:58.720> earlier<00:01:58.810> which

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
his gases up a little bit earlier which

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
which is he went gasps first until this

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.440 
which is he went gasps first until this
means<00:02:02.980> as<00:02:03.310> they<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.580> probably<00:02:04.030> going<00:02:04.240> for

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
really miss since we had 150 gasps we've

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.830 
really miss since we had 150 gasps we've
got<00:04:21.650> our<00:04:21.769> aliens<00:04:22.310> building<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:22.880> we<00:04:23.720> have

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
and that's preventing a lot of the

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.120 
and that's preventing a lot of the
damage<00:06:35.620> from<00:06:35.650> being<00:06:35.950> done<00:06:37.530> of<00:06:38.530> course<00:06:38.770> my<00:06:38.890> tank
