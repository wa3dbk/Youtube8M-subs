00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.000
 this message from nasa on forks 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.790
 he loves the country can no longer be displayed 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.950
 I do not think we can create a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.870
 neither here 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.190
 enem on the internet run and succeed 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.860
 have access to the site 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.570
 now if you come back here 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.670
 and erase 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 muntari accessing the site normally 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 can come here 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 constrained by cottbus 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 on the internet you can also 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.869
 we already have the session 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.369
 everyday site 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 and here too 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.329
 another thing you can do with this file and redirection 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.959
 type of sites 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.319
 such that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.319
 I will explain in practice also for you to understand better 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.609
 with twitter 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.969
 dodo 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 Of google 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.489
 We'll stay here from google. 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.119
 mayor and google 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.249
 Let's put it here. 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.409
 and here in front the name of the site 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409
 it's going to be difficult but the turmoil 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.239
 the ox that redirects the goal 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.749
 What comforts is that every time a person avoids bowl 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.769
 not browser to get into the cake 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 he will be directed to this beijing 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 enters the goal here 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.829
 I count on a kick 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.199
 to the balcony with good foot 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.579
 enter google site 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 and if we do that, we can go there too. 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.369
 same thing 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.229
 was the seventh goal too 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.629
 It's more so that I want to do this. 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.870
 party heavily used in phishing scams Preventive scam of the victim's machine 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.870
 find something to get orkut password for example i know a page 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.559
 false hosts her 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.019
 here you put the ipi of the false track in front 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.999
 the name of the site weather kuyt 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.699
 that is to say every time the person supplies the cattle exits explained to fear 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.939
 she tries to enter 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.939
 it will be directed to your fake page 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.839
 here in case they end 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.399
 and has indicated 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.799
 the origin of the high 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.559
 and so she gets the password for you 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.559
 in the case almost no one to do this I take quoting as 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.659
 there is 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.029
 You can do it 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.249
 It's not like windows has 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:24.289
 have resources that can do a lot 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.599
 interesting 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.759
 so this is it people said
