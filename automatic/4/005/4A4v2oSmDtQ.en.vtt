once you delete it it will delete the
bootanimation<00:01:24.299> zip<00:01:25.400> usually<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> want<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
bootanimation zip usually if you want to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
bootanimation zip usually if you want to
replace<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.530> boot<00:01:28.860> animation<00:01:29.310> does<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
replace the boot animation does it this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
replace the boot animation does it this
is<00:01:29.880> another<00:01:30.119> way<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> doing<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.320> haven't

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is another way of doing it but I haven't

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
is another way of doing it but I haven't
figured<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.890> how<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.340> correctly<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
figured out how to do it correctly so I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
figured out how to do it correctly so I
don't<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> give<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> guys<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> bad<00:01:34.470> guide

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
don't want to give you guys a bad guide

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.060 
don't want to give you guys a bad guide
so<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> cwm<00:01:37.560> way

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so I'm just going to do it the cwm way

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
so I'm just going to do it the cwm way
so<00:01:40.340> another<00:01:41.340> clockwork<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.000> should<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> say<00:01:42.360> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so another clockwork way should I say so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
so another clockwork way should I say so
um<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
um here you can do it like that so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
um here you can do it like that so
that's<00:01:44.909> four<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.509> did<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:48.259> crisis

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that's four I did that for the crisis

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's four I did that for the crisis
revolution<00:01:49.710> theme<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> mounts<00:01:51.060> back

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
revolution theme it's on the mounts back

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
revolution theme it's on the mounts back
as<00:01:51.600> our<00:01:51.810> oh<00:01:52.850> yeah<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> go

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
as our oh yeah and so you want to go

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
as our oh yeah and so you want to go
into<00:01:57.299> USB<00:01:57.689> debugging<00:01:57.930> mode<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:59.009> them

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
into USB debugging mode and put them

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.889 
into USB debugging mode and put them
into<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.460> internal<00:02:00.030> SD<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> once<00:02:00.719> you've

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
into your internal SD and once you've

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.400 
into your internal SD and once you've
done<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> boot<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.280> recovery

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.660 

and<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:10.119> basically<00:02:10.770> apply<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.830> zip<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:12.520> as

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and you basically apply the zip it's as

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
and you basically apply the zip it's as
simple<00:02:12.820> as<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.860> add<00:02:15.960> boot<00:02:16.960> animations

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
simple as that to add boot animations

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:27.800 
simple as that to add boot animations
via<00:02:17.830> your<00:02:18.130> own<00:02:18.720> clockwork<00:02:19.720> recovery
