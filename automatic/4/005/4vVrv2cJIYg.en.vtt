close<00:01:39.990> quartered<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.890> feel<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
close quartered and I feel like all the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
close quartered and I feel like all the
characters<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.210> better<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.020> position

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
characters are better in that position

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.810 
characters are better in that position
but<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> remember<00:01:44.579> which

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
but you don't have to remember which

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
but you don't have to remember which
give<00:01:45.030> dr.<00:01:45.329> Chester<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:45.780> advantage<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.439> all

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
give dr. Chester an advantage it's all

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.060 
give dr. Chester an advantage it's all
you<00:01:47.009> need<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> simply<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> hold<00:01:48.149> RT<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:48.869> 2<00:01:49.829> or

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you need to simply do is hold RT or 2 or

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.889 
you need to simply do is hold RT or 2 or
whatever<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> PC<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.780> will

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
whatever it is on the PC and it will

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.690 
whatever it is on the PC and it will
automatically<00:01:52.619> keep<00:01:52.770> firing<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.579> need

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
automatically keep firing you don't need

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
automatically keep firing you don't need
to<00:01:53.850> keep<00:01:54.000> tapping<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.840> trigger<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.530> fire<00:01:55.560> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to keep tapping the trigger to fire it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.440 
to keep tapping the trigger to fire it
will<00:01:56.189> automatically<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.299> i<00:01:57.420> think

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
will automatically do it which i think

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
will automatically do it which i think
is<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> nice<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.320> feature<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is a nice little feature just like the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
is a nice little feature just like the
astronaut<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.570> well<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.560> your

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
astronaut is as well but there is your

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.510 
astronaut is as well but there is your
number<00:02:01.979> 5<00:02:02.189> spot

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
number 5 spot

at number four we have the
paleontologist<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.980> I'm<00:02:07.130> sure<00:02:07.280> what<00:02:07.580> are<00:02:07.640> you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
paleontologist and I'm sure what are you

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.700 
paleontologist and I'm sure what are you
thinking<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.560> paleontologists<00:02:09.560> because

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
thinking what paleontologists because

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.200 
thinking what paleontologists because
I've<00:02:09.830> heard<00:02:10.010> a<00:02:10.040> lot<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.280> people<00:02:10.580> saying<00:02:10.790> this

I've heard a lot of people saying this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.240 
I've heard a lot of people saying this
character<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.780> overp<00:02:12.110> old<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.530> needs<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.980> nerve

character is overp old and needs a nerve

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.920 
character is overp old and needs a nerve
but<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.880> my<00:02:14.000> personal<00:02:14.240> opinion<00:02:14.870> because

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
but in my personal opinion because

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.960 
but in my personal opinion because
remember<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.920> my<00:02:16.130> opinion<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
remember this is all my opinion the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.150 
remember this is all my opinion the
paleontologist<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.020> good<00:02:18.260> medium<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> long

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
paleontologist is good medium to long

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.100 
paleontologist is good medium to long
range<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.670> course<00:02:20.000> he's<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> scientist<00:02:20.930> he's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
range of course he's a scientist he's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.930 
range of course he's a scientist he's
good<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.380> close<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.950> damage<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.700> quite

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
good up close but the damage is quite

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.460 
good up close but the damage is quite
good<00:02:23.240> at<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> distance<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.200> when<00:02:24.350> I'm<00:02:24.440> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
good at a distance but when I'm a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.060 
good at a distance but when I'm a
scientist

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
scientist

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.890 
scientist
I<00:02:25.130> like<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.460> get<00:02:25.610> right<00:02:25.850> up<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> faces<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
I like to get right up in the faces I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.140 
I like to get right up in the faces I
like<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.440> be<00:02:27.530> at<00:02:27.650> point-blank<00:02:28.010> range<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.940> in

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
like to be at point-blank range right in

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150 
like to be at point-blank range right in
the<00:02:29.240> plants<00:02:29.510> face<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.050> damage<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:31.010> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the plants face to do damage and like I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.440 
the plants face to do damage and like I
said<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.550> are<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.700> lot<00:02:31.850> more<00:02:31.880> characters

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
said there are a lot more characters

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030 
said there are a lot more characters
that<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> lot<00:02:32.900> better<00:02:33.050> at<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that are a lot better at this but the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.070 
that are a lot better at this but the
reason<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.460> at<00:02:34.580> number<00:02:34.700> four<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.480> he<00:02:35.630> does<00:02:35.840> have

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
reason is at number four is he does have

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.750 
reason is at number four is he does have
the<00:02:36.230> burning<00:02:36.470> effects<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.250> he<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the burning effects because he is the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
the burning effects because he is the
fire<00:02:37.940> variant<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.720> scientists<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.710> yes

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
fire variant for the scientists so yes

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.790 
fire variant for the scientists so yes
that<00:02:40.430> fire<00:02:40.670> damage<00:02:41.330> will<00:02:41.570> give<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.930> damage<00:02:42.440> over

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
that fire damage will give a damage over

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.500 
that fire damage will give a damage over
a<00:02:42.830> period<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.280> time<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.850> if<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:44.210> in<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
a period of time and if you are in a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.420 
a period of time and if you are in a
medium<00:02:44.810> range<00:02:44.990> on<00:02:45.290> your<00:02:45.740> own<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.040> girders

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
medium range on your own like girders

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.920 
medium range on your own like girders
and<00:02:46.520> graveyards<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:47.720> firing

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
and graveyards and you are just firing

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.230 
and graveyards and you are just firing
onto<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.440> garden<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.100> damage<00:02:49.730> plants

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
onto the garden you can damage plants

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.090 
onto the garden you can damage plants
and<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.900> course<00:02:51.140> set<00:02:51.380> them<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.620> fire<00:02:51.890> which

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and of course set them on fire which

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.770 
and of course set them on fire which
could<00:02:52.310> potentially<00:02:52.460> burn<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:53.600> my

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
could potentially burn them but my

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.690 
could potentially burn them but my
personal<00:02:54.230> opinion<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.770> he<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.160> not<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.460> most

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
personal opinion is he is not the most

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.700 
personal opinion is he is not the most
favorite<00:02:56.120> character<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.320> use<00:02:57.470> as

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
favorite character that I like to use as

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.740 
favorite character that I like to use as
the<00:02:57.920> scientist<00:02:58.430> but<00:02:58.760> anyway<00:02:59.030> there<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.570> your

the scientist but anyway there is your

the<00:03:07.310> legends<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.850> lawn<00:03:08.060> dlc<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.780> believe

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the legends of the lawn dlc I believe

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.229 
the legends of the lawn dlc I believe
the<00:03:09.410> fire<00:03:09.680> rate<00:03:09.890> was<00:03:10.070> reduced<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.760> I'm<00:03:11.060> not

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
the fire rate was reduced and I'm not

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.090 
the fire rate was reduced and I'm not
entirely<00:03:11.660> sure<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.380> damage<00:03:12.709> was<00:03:12.860> or<00:03:12.980> not

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
entirely sure if the damage was or not

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.890 
entirely sure if the damage was or not
but<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.580> marine<00:03:13.820> biologist<00:03:14.360> up<00:03:14.570> at<00:03:14.690> close

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
but the marine biologist up at close

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.400 
but the marine biologist up at close
range<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.920> serious<00:03:16.489> serious<00:03:17.120> bad<00:03:17.870> boy<00:03:18.140> if

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
range is a serious serious bad boy if

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.080 
range is a serious serious bad boy if
you<00:03:18.709> get<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> critical<00:03:19.190> hit<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.760> destroy<00:03:20.060> a

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
you get a critical hit you can destroy a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.970 
you get a critical hit you can destroy a
sunflower<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.810> two<00:03:20.989> hits<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.410> still<00:03:21.709> believe

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
sunflower in two hits I still believe

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.710 
sunflower in two hits I still believe
which<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.550> absolutely<00:03:23.000> insane

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
which is absolutely insane

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.270 
which is absolutely insane
now<00:03:23.959> yes<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.650> would<00:03:24.830> have<00:03:24.950> been<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.070> number

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
now yes this would have been a number

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
now yes this would have been a number
one<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:25.880> since<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.270> nerve<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
one but since the nerve in the in the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.070 
one but since the nerve in the in the
the<00:03:27.830> rate<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.160> fire<00:03:28.370> feel<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.239> he's<00:03:29.480> not<00:03:29.750> as

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the rate of fire feel like he's not as

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.780 
the rate of fire feel like he's not as
good<00:03:30.200> as<00:03:30.440> what<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.680> used<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.280> there<00:03:31.700> are

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
good as what it used to be and there are

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.070 
good as what it used to be and there are
other<00:03:31.940> characters<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.450> are<00:03:32.690> much<00:03:32.870> better

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
other characters that are much better

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.410 
other characters that are much better
suited<00:03:33.200> for<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:33.950> playing<00:03:34.280> style<00:03:34.420> hopefully

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
suited for my playing style hopefully

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
suited for my playing style hopefully
you<00:03:35.600> understand<00:03:36.110> wise<00:03:36.320> at<00:03:36.560> number<00:03:36.769> three<00:03:37.040> and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
you understand wise at number three and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.550 
you understand wise at number three and
I'm<00:03:37.670> sure<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.150> marine<00:03:38.390> biologist<00:03:38.870> even<00:03:39.290> after

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
I'm sure the marine biologist even after

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.890 
I'm sure the marine biologist even after
the<00:03:39.680> nerve<00:03:39.830> will<00:03:40.340> still<00:03:40.550> be<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:40.790> your<00:03:40.940> top<00:03:41.209> 5<00:03:41.510> if

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the nerve will still be in your top 5 if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.360 
the nerve will still be in your top 5 if
you<00:03:41.959> do<00:03:42.200> want<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.410> give<00:03:42.560> your<00:03:42.709> top<00:03:42.920> 5<00:03:43.130> down

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
you do want to give your top 5 down

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.860 
you do want to give your top 5 down
below<00:03:43.640> leave<00:03:44.060> them<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> comment<00:03:44.840> section

below leave them in the comment section

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810 
below leave them in the comment section
but<00:03:45.290> anyway<00:03:45.560> there<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:46.070> your<00:03:46.250> number<00:03:46.459> 3<00:03:46.700> spot

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
but anyway there is your number 3 spot

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:55.680 
but anyway there is your number 3 spot
the<00:03:47.300> marine<00:03:47.570> biologist

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.660 

at<00:03:56.690> number<00:03:57.170> two<00:03:57.350> we<00:03:57.680> have<00:03:57.920> at<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> chemists

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
at number two we have at the chemists

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.860 
at number two we have at the chemists
now<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.880> chemists<00:03:59.240> used<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> be<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.720> most

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
now the chemists used to be the most

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.750 
now the chemists used to be the most
overpowered<00:04:00.530> character<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.190> game<00:04:01.400> but

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
overpowered character in the game but

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.100 
overpowered character in the game but
then<00:04:01.910> was<00:04:02.060> nerved<00:04:02.300> in<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.630> legends<00:04:02.960> of<00:04:03.050> the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
then was nerved in the legends of the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.200 
then was nerved in the legends of the
lawn<00:04:03.350> dlc<00:04:03.920> i<00:04:03.950> believe<00:04:04.400> or<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.850> may<00:04:04.970> have<00:04:05.000> been

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
lawn dlc i believe or it may have been

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.570 
lawn dlc i believe or it may have been
before<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.690> I'm<00:04:06.200> not<00:04:06.410> exactly<00:04:06.530> sure<00:04:06.890> but<00:04:07.460> the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
before that I'm not exactly sure but the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.190 
before that I'm not exactly sure but the
chemist<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.090> my<00:04:08.270> favorite<00:04:08.720> character<00:04:08.840> being

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
chemist is my favorite character being

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.310 
chemist is my favorite character being
face<00:04:09.800> front<00:04:10.490> in<00:04:10.790> front<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.420> plants<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:11.870> is

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
face front in front of the plants and is

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.380 
face front in front of the plants and is
definitely<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:13.070> goal<00:04:13.520> to<00:04:13.670> character<00:04:14.090> if<00:04:14.210> that

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
definitely a goal to character if that

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.240 
definitely a goal to character if that
is<00:04:14.480> your<00:04:14.630> playing<00:04:14.870> style<00:04:15.080> now<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.680> reason<00:04:16.040> he

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
is your playing style now the reason he

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.860 
is your playing style now the reason he
is<00:04:16.280> much<00:04:16.550> higher<00:04:16.790> than<00:04:17.000> dr.<00:04:17.330> Chester<00:04:17.600> which

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
is much higher than dr. Chester which

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.070 
is much higher than dr. Chester which
does<00:04:18.050> a<00:04:18.200> similar<00:04:18.560> role<00:04:19.520> in<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.930> scientist<00:04:20.930> is

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
does a similar role in the scientist is

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.440 
does a similar role in the scientist is
because<00:04:21.410> they<00:04:21.530> only<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.670> short<00:04:22.700> range<00:04:23.300> but

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
because they only have a short range but

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.660 
because they only have a short range but
do<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> lot<00:04:23.930> more<00:04:23.960> damage<00:04:24.290> is<00:04:24.680> dr.<00:04:25.460> Chester

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
do a lot more damage is dr. Chester

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.700 
do a lot more damage is dr. Chester
fires<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.090> lot<00:04:26.330> faster<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.200> chemist<00:04:27.530> fires

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
fires a lot faster and the chemist fires

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.560 
fires a lot faster and the chemist fires
slower<00:04:28.040> but<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> chemist<00:04:28.850> does<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.150> lot<00:04:29.390> more

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
slower but the chemist does a lot more

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.290 
slower but the chemist does a lot more
damage<00:04:29.780> but<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.410> also<00:04:30.650> have<00:04:31.040> a<00:04:31.250> 180<00:04:31.940> degree

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
damage but you also have a 180 degree

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.030 
damage but you also have a 180 degree
angle<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.810> believe<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.620> chemist<00:04:33.950> can

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
angle I believe that the chemist can

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.860 
angle I believe that the chemist can
fire<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.820> if<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.060> are<00:04:35.180> facing<00:04:35.570> forward

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
fire in so if you are facing forward

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.740 
fire in so if you are facing forward
anyone<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.950> in<00:04:37.130> 180<00:04:37.910> degrees<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.480> front

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
anyone that is in 180 degrees in front

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.050 
anyone that is in 180 degrees in front
of<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:39.020> will<00:04:39.380> be<00:04:39.500> damaged<00:04:39.890> by<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.130> chemist<00:04:40.670> so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
of you will be damaged by the chemist so

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.060 
of you will be damaged by the chemist so
it<00:04:41.300> can<00:04:41.480> affect<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:42.050> lot<00:04:42.350> more<00:04:42.500> plants<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.980> a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
it can affect a lot more plants in a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.920 
it can affect a lot more plants in a
certain<00:04:43.400> area<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:43.940> they<00:04:44.270> are<00:04:44.420> clustered

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
certain area if they are clustered

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.780 
certain area if they are clustered
together<00:04:45.200> which<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.430> do<00:04:46.550> and

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
together which I like to do and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.190 
together which I like to do and
personally<00:04:47.240> come<00:04:47.420> across<00:04:47.660> quite<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.930> lot

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
personally come across quite a lot

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.990 
personally come across quite a lot
because<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.740> play<00:04:48.980> guns<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.400> graveyards<00:04:49.880> and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
because I play guns in graveyards and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.450 
because I play guns in graveyards and
you<00:04:50.390> get<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.540> lot<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.750> plants<00:04:51.140> in<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.320> garden<00:04:51.890> so

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
you get a lot of plants in the garden so

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.570 
you get a lot of plants in the garden so
the<00:04:53.240> chemist<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.780> an<00:04:54.020> ideal<00:04:54.680> character<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.340> use

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the chemist is an ideal character to use

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.850 
the chemist is an ideal character to use
so<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.720> why<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.960> chemist<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.500> at<00:04:57.650> number

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
so that is why the chemist is at number

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.740 
so that is why the chemist is at number
two<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.220> number<00:04:58.250> one<00:04:58.550> spot<00:04:58.730> can<00:04:59.420> be<00:04:59.450> quite

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
two the number one spot can be quite

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.270 
two the number one spot can be quite
good<00:04:59.870> in<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.170> area<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.710> also<00:05:00.890> better<00:05:01.190> in

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
good in that area but is also better in

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.550 
good in that area but is also better in
other<00:05:01.520> situations<00:05:02.390> as<00:05:02.600> well<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.440> why

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
other situations as well so that is why

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.680 
other situations as well so that is why
the<00:05:03.620> chemist<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.130> at<00:05:04.460> only<00:05:04.730> number<00:05:05.180> two<00:05:05.360> but

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
the chemist is at only number two but

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.030 
the chemist is at only number two but
there<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.900> your<00:05:06.020> number<00:05:06.230> two<00:05:06.350> spot<00:05:06.500> the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
there is your number two spot the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.029 
there is your number two spot the
chemist

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.240 

and<00:05:13.270> at<00:05:14.270> number<00:05:14.419> one<00:05:14.599> we<00:05:15.080> have<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.620> astronauts

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
and at number one we have the astronauts

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.460 
and at number one we have the astronauts
now<00:05:16.520> remember<00:05:16.879> this<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.389> my<00:05:17.419> personal<00:05:17.870> opinion

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
now remember this is my personal opinion

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.020 
now remember this is my personal opinion
and<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.830> astronaut<00:05:19.340> funny<00:05:19.580> enough<00:05:19.789> got<00:05:20.000> a

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
and the astronaut funny enough got a

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.330 
and the astronaut funny enough got a
buff<00:05:20.330> in<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.599> legends<00:05:21.349> of<00:05:21.439> the<00:05:21.500> lawn<00:05:21.740> DLC<00:05:22.219> they

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
buff in the legends of the lawn DLC they

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.279 
buff in the legends of the lawn DLC they
increased<00:05:22.699> his<00:05:22.939> damage<00:05:23.330> slightly<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:23.960> the

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
increased his damage slightly and the

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.659 
increased his damage slightly and the
reason<00:05:24.560> they<00:05:24.740> said<00:05:24.979> for<00:05:25.159> that<00:05:25.219> was<00:05:25.400> because

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
reason they said for that was because

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:26.860 
reason they said for that was because
the<00:05:25.789> astronaut<00:05:26.090> doesn't<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.479> Splash<00:05:26.840> Damage

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
the astronaut doesn't have Splash Damage

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.020 
the astronaut doesn't have Splash Damage
whereas<00:05:27.710> most<00:05:27.889> of<00:05:28.159> the<00:05:28.250> other<00:05:28.430> characters<00:05:28.580> do

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
whereas most of the other characters do

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.700 
whereas most of the other characters do
but<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.629> honestly<00:05:29.990> thought<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.349> astronaut

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
but I honestly thought the astronaut

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.499 
but I honestly thought the astronaut
didn't<00:05:30.949> need<00:05:31.069> a<00:05:31.099> buff<00:05:31.340> anyway<00:05:31.729> his<00:05:32.090> rate<00:05:32.330> of

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
didn't need a buff anyway his rate of

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.059 
didn't need a buff anyway his rate of
fire<00:05:32.719> was<00:05:32.930> quite<00:05:33.199> fast<00:05:33.500> here<00:05:33.770> was<00:05:33.919> an

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
fire was quite fast here was an

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.100 
fire was quite fast here was an
automatic<00:05:34.699> one<00:05:34.819> similar<00:05:35.449> to<00:05:35.509> dr.<00:05:35.870> Chester

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
automatic one similar to dr. Chester

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.480 
automatic one similar to dr. Chester
where<00:05:36.379> you<00:05:36.500> simply<00:05:36.860> hold<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.189> trigger<00:05:37.400> down

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
where you simply hold the trigger down

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.640 
where you simply hold the trigger down
and<00:05:38.030> he<00:05:38.120> will<00:05:38.240> constantly<00:05:38.479> fire<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.319> the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
and he will constantly fire and the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.709 
and he will constantly fire and the
damage<00:05:39.979> is<00:05:40.159> good<00:05:40.400> at<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.610> long<00:05:40.939> range<00:05:40.969> it<00:05:41.389> is

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
damage is good at a long range it is

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.659 
damage is good at a long range it is
good<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.990> medium<00:05:42.469> range<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:43.039> good<00:05:43.219> at<00:05:43.370> a

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
good a medium range and is good at a

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.999 
good a medium range and is good at a
short<00:05:44.030> range<00:05:44.360> just<00:05:44.780> think<00:05:45.020> how<00:05:45.199> fast<00:05:45.500> he<00:05:45.710> fires

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
short range just think how fast he fires

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.800 
short range just think how fast he fires
and<00:05:46.490> if<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.699> are<00:05:46.819> at<00:05:46.940> close<00:05:47.180> range<00:05:47.449> you<00:05:47.539> can<00:05:47.690> do

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
and if you are at close range you can do

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.200 
and if you are at close range you can do
like<00:05:47.960> 22<00:05:48.500> damage<00:05:48.860> in<00:05:49.009> a<00:05:49.099> critical<00:05:49.460> hit<00:05:49.669> which

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
like 22 damage in a critical hit which

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.029 
like 22 damage in a critical hit which
is<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.539> really<00:05:51.020> really<00:05:51.169> good<00:05:51.409> amount<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.740> damage

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
is a really really good amount of damage

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.189 
is a really really good amount of damage
especially<00:05:52.190> with<00:05:52.819> his<00:05:53.030> rate<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.300> fire<00:05:53.690> now<00:05:54.139> the

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
especially with his rate of fire now the

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.260 
especially with his rate of fire now the
reason<00:05:54.560> he<00:05:54.740> is<00:05:54.770> at<00:05:54.949> number<00:05:55.039> one<00:05:55.310> is<00:05:55.460> his<00:05:55.879> damage

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
reason he is at number one is his damage

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.600 
reason he is at number one is his damage
is<00:05:56.389> good<00:05:56.659> at<00:05:56.780> any<00:05:57.020> range<00:05:57.289> and<00:05:57.590> also<00:05:57.979> he<00:05:58.370> can<00:05:58.520> be

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
is good at any range and also he can be

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.059 
is good at any range and also he can be
used<00:05:58.909> at<00:05:59.150> any<00:05:59.330> range<00:05:59.629> the<00:06:00.110> chemists<00:06:00.469> can<00:06:00.860> only

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
used at any range the chemists can only

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.249 
used at any range the chemists can only
be<00:06:01.280> useful<00:06:01.669> at<00:06:01.819> a<00:06:02.000> close<00:06:02.300> range<00:06:02.449> whereas<00:06:03.139> the

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
be useful at a close range whereas the

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.140 
be useful at a close range whereas the
astronaut<00:06:03.650> could<00:06:03.830> be<00:06:03.889> used<00:06:04.099> at<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.699> medium

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
astronaut could be used at a medium

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.029 
astronaut could be used at a medium
range<00:06:05.330> for<00:06:05.930> example<00:06:06.020> if<00:06:06.469> you<00:06:06.590> are<00:06:06.620> playing<00:06:06.919> as

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
range for example if you are playing as

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.860 
range for example if you are playing as
the<00:06:07.159> chemist<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.669> this<00:06:07.789> plant<00:06:08.180> like<00:06:08.689> a

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
the chemist and this plant like a

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.170 
the chemist and this plant like a
sunflower<00:06:09.319> is<00:06:09.650> just<00:06:10.129> slightly<00:06:10.580> out<00:06:10.789> of<00:06:10.939> the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
sunflower is just slightly out of the

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.969 
sunflower is just slightly out of the
chemists<00:06:11.539> range<00:06:11.779> then<00:06:12.229> that<00:06:12.379> sunflower<00:06:12.800> is

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
chemists range then that sunflower is

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.920 
chemists range then that sunflower is
going<00:06:13.159> to<00:06:13.250> destroy<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:13.819> chemist<00:06:14.180> whereas<00:06:14.810> the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
going to destroy the chemist whereas the

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.629 
going to destroy the chemist whereas the
astronaut<00:06:15.409> you<00:06:15.889> will<00:06:16.009> be<00:06:16.069> able<00:06:16.159> to<00:06:16.279> take<00:06:16.520> that

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
astronaut you will be able to take that

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.339 
astronaut you will be able to take that
sunflower<00:06:17.090> oh<00:06:17.300> it's<00:06:17.509> no<00:06:17.659> matter<00:06:17.840> what<00:06:18.139> range

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
sunflower oh it's no matter what range
