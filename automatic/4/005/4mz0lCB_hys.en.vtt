00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello to all these niggers two cases then 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 today it's going to be a video a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.410
 little bit short 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.379
 simply because there is no big 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 to say of course on the map but 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.609
 it is a map that is who and who 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 is in the news we will say there is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 a few days of that it was this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 period so some of you have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 surely does egg hunts and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 seven map suggests you to do 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 a base on minecraft simply 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 so this is an egg hunting map of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 Easter 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.390
 so she's called easter egg hunt and 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.780
 it was created by taxi conde then I 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 do not know if he pronounces well if kojima 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.360
 second royal regiment 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 so here you can find him on 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 youtube and then see see his others 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 maps 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 so pass a map is simple you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.140
 go see it we'll fly over it because 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.109
 that I'm in creative mode so already 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.079
 I leave you there in normal life 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.120
 then it's a map iliad 10th per stage 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 did not leave the level as long as you 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 do not have all the eggs and there is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.020
 all on map 59 to find so 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
 here is share this map with our friends 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.549
 and play in peaceful survival 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 so here is this map you go 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 to see me I'll fly away one 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.430
 will be simpler so there are eggs 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.540
 hidden 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 there are about fifty stamps in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.860
 all over the map divided into 5 to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 say five levels it will be 5 decor 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 different you have the first here with 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 which are two kinds of long corridors 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 in fact between shrubs 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 then you have the second level here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.799
 so it's going to be a level with 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.130
 trees all the trees while 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 along the third level 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.950
 so the level with cacti the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.009
 fourth so we did not have any more 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.420
 to say firs as trees and the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.439
 last level finally who is a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.090
 labyrinth 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 so we will go back to the first 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.619
 level to show you how that is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.659
 go a little bit I 'm going to ask myself here 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.130
 there it will be very good so here in the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.890
 lÃ© you first walk around in c 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.570
 these great corridors and your goal will be to 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.610
 find the chests like here you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.730
 see we have a stamp here with men 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.900
 inside and you have one 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 zen a dozen to find by one by 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.010
 level only by bodies so 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.519
 the device has some that are surely hidden 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.349
 in the trees 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.360
 so I did not seek to tell you 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.980
 honestly but surely there are some 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.780
 hide a little everywhere we will try 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.549
 to find one would not be bad if 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.540
 I can pass 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.319
 watch out you can destroy yourself 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.940
 the leaves me I'm not going to them 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.440
 destroy because I'm creative I 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.379
 fly away and will be much simpler 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.410
 but where are we going to try to 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 find one here too 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.640
 if we would have a talk failing after that 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.079
 I do not find in any case there is a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.400
 little bit of a little bit of research at 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.200
 do it anyway it can take you 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.090
 lose a little bit of time even though that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.450
 it's definitely not the most 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.500
 long as the welcome that I have you 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.269
 presented a simply 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.859
 it's probably the most 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.720
 shortest short but she was 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.819
 in the spirit of the time I find hold 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.620
 our son he was in the spirit of 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.579
 time she was finally in the spirit of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.739
 time she was mostly in 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.090
 the news with easter that just comes 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.190
 to go through so I wanted to put this 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 video before it's true that the room 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.079
 which brought to that level but that makes a 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 small booster a little booster of eggs from 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.720
 Easter 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.329
 just another here rents 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 hidden in the trees in this one 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.209
 do not go there, you're going to have one 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.680
 little bit everywhere so it's the same 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.040
 it's going down from labyrinth to all 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.989
 time so well it's not easy either 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.120
 eh, because we're lucky 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.250
 to pass like that next to miss 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.900
 a chest so here you have the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.250
 cactus level veiled in the level 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.980
 fir trees that looks a bit low at 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.690
 second level we saw we like 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.430
 you surely had coppola we had 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.780
 opposite here in nation there will be 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.760
 pardon surely in the trees and we will 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.859
 go to the labyrinth level for you 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.940
 show a little bit we will put ourselves here 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.310
 I saw that there was a chest 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.739
 would be so a little bit too much 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.940
 so here you have a labyrinth all 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.269
 what is more classic but everything 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.160
 what's more a little annoying a 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.300
 labyrinth has besides if you do not 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.410
 have not seen it g 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.780
 a map that I created and myself that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.820
 is called a labyrinth 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.030
 spread over five levels and you'll see 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.260
 it's easy to get lost 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.500
 it's always nice then it's nice 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.760
 was okay so here's listening to a 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.440
 like I wanted 10 and a pretty video 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.270
 short is not much to say to 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.660
 share good chances to find all 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.130
 his eggs 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.140
 it's about fifty as I 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.710
 wanted at the beginning of this video spread 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.550
 on the map 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.650
 and then and then we will test here I 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.760
 you say goodbye to all and to very 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.760
 soon hi everyone
