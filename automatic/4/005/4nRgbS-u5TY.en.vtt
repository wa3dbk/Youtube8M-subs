00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello friends today we are 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.960
 continue our cycle of transmissions 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.420
 answer your questions and talk about 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 this category of visitors to the gym 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.609
 halls that are hard to gain muscle 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 mass 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.949
 many of them call themselves ectomorph me 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 according to the theory of doctor william sheldon 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.260
 there are three body types 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 ectomorph endomorphs mesomorphic type 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.020
 physique mesa thief ectomorph endomorph 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.930
 mainly determined by the structure 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.610
 skeleton and the amount of fat and muscle 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 fabrics that cover it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.579
 but when sheldon created his theory he 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 thought was not at all about bodybuilding about 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.770
 body constitution and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.020
 temperament male human 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 After all, research about his conducted in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.190
 the field of psychology is the conclusions of its 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.399
 sheldon based 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.010
 on the study of a large number 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.560
 photos of students who studied in 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.439
 Institute where he worked their measurements and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.750
 analysis of their temperaments as a result sheldon 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.150
 claimed to have 3 photos 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 front and back and side of a person 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 male he can much about him 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 tell here is such a story by the way 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.280
 modern psychology has many 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.540
 questions to this theory and so the first if 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 you are under 18 and you are not very 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 large build then it is not at all 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 says that you are even proceeding from this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 theories 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 somehow mod for this theory concerns 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.840
 only adults besides sheldon 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.790
 claimed to meet in the life of a pure 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 ectomorph mesomorphs rental Martha 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 is unlikely because in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.689
 every person can not be 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.100
 only one type is presented 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.110
 on the other hand you can often hear 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.469
 what have this or that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.299
 bodybuilder genes and good therefore 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.750
 he is more likely to succeed 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.000
 so who are these good genes when 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.300
 speak genetics muscle first of all 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.130
 means its shape 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 and the shape determines the two most important 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.650
 location factors relative 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.290
 other muscles and and and structures we appear 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.030
 to light the finished form of muscle genetics 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.820
 determines in advance where the muscles come from 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.320
 begins where ends 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.380
 attached bones where located and 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.860
 belly and how it is built 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.990
 everything is predetermined 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.940
 even the features of the structure and structure 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.010
 muscle fibers that's why and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.630
 it turns out that some people are genetically 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.870
 very good muscles in terms of 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.630
 bodybuilding about others are bad but it is pure 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.160
 theoretically genetics really 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.080
 plays a huge role when you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.800
 going to perform on the world stage 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.450
 but become physically developed before such 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.950
 degrees to pay attention to you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.100
 can be everyone 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.850
 what to do if the muscles do not stick well 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.690
 Need to answer three questions regarding 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.850
 your nutritional rest and workouts if 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.760
 you answer them correctly then you 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.030
 can surprise the old psychologist 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.330
 william herbert shelton rest he must 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.800
 be calm enough if it is difficult 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.080
 you gain mass then 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.750
 do something else in parallel 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.790
 active sports 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.420
 run crosses play football and stuff not 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.970
 should sleep should be order 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.640
 eight hours a day or better even 10 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.980
 if you sleep less then 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.070
 muscle growth recovery processes 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.260
 slow down and you grow slower 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.570
 food for this category should 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.230
 match the formula 50 percent 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.430
 carbohydrates 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.380
 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.290
 not to repeat i recommend you 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.959
 see our story called 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 nutrition to gain muscle mass for 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.520
 the category considered today is not 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.560
 terrible all kinds of carbohydrates but still 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.860
 they should be as up to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.080
 opportunities from slow carbohydrates but 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.820
 after a training meal it's like 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.239
 times that case when carbohydrates are suitable 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.510
 they should be quickly and directly in food 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.510
 less than five many may experience 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.480
 the question is why so when we recruit we 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.479
 must eat often and when we lose weight 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.880
 we have to eat often for someone can 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.830
 this seem like a paradox but a paradox 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
 no there is because everything is here 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.169
 depends on what to eat when 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.070
 muscle gain is essential 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.470
 the component carbohydrate and 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.760
 total calorie obviously proteins should 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.419
 be in sight 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:58.120
 chicken meat fish and eggs and naturally 3 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.800
 macronutrients are fat and should 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.169
 be sure to enter the body 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.530
 regardless of whether you want to dial 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.330
 or lose weight without fat is impossible 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.880
 normal endocrine system in 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.520
 including the synthesis of the king of hormones 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.070
 bodybuilding testosterone a normal 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.979
 state of the joints of vitamin assimilation 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.180
 normal brain function and stuff all this 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.720
 depends on fats in general fats are needed by everyone 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.580
 and just thin category 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.770
 gym visitors lucky 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.950
 that they can consume them enough 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.169
 Feel free to workout this way 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.310
 so that they are 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.689
 short-lived intense states 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.340
 maximum of basic exercises 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.550
 exercise must be order 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.229
 five to six 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.870
 workouts should not be much in a week 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.900
 no more than three 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.610
 some may even be enough 2 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.819
 splits may look like this 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:04.240
 chest triceps back biceps delta legs 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:06.699
 or chest triceps bandages back biceps 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.589
 feet for two days for example there is 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.539
 classic flexion option 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:14.469
 the flexor of the extensor to the extensor 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.949
 im breasts triceps quadriceps 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:21.330
 back biceps hip flexor and so what 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.919
 Conclusion can do today if you 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.550
 attend regularly gym but 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.520
 while muscle mass stubbornly does not want 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.199
 grow then don't rush to bet on 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.110
 forehead stamp ectomorph 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.939
 firstly because sheldon theory 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.639
 touched absolutely no questions 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:45.250
 progress in bodybuilding and she touched 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.259
 psychology secondly try 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.240
 answer those same three questions about 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.180
 whom we touched today your 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.389
 food your workouts and your rest and 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.610
 if you answer them correctly then you 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.800
 not going anywhere and start typing 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.379
 as most often muscle growth 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.740
 rests not at all in genetics but in 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:08.499
 daily routine and procyon well on 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.229
 this is today all hope for you this 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:14.219
 information will be interesting to new 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.219
 meetings yet 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:20.460
 old terry 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.460
 professor up
