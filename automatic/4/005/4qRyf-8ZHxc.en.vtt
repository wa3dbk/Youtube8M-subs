we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> talk<00:00:11.610> about<00:00:11.639> filtration<00:00:12.269> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
we're going to talk about filtration and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480 
we're going to talk about filtration and
the<00:00:12.929> importance<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.710> air<00:00:13.889> flow<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.340> your

single time it comes on it's taken the
dust<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:19.890> home<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.460> simply

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
dust in your home and it's simply

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
dust in your home and it's simply
pumping<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> through<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.539> duct<00:00:21.720> system<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
pumping it through your duct system and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.540 
pumping it through your duct system and
recirculating<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> through<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.369> house

recirculating it through your house

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
recirculating it through your house
that's<00:00:24.300> why<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.660> filtration<00:00:25.289> there's<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that's why you have filtration there's a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
that's why you have filtration there's a
lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.580> options<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.150> filters<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
lot of options and filters I'm going to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
lot of options and filters I'm going to
show<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.130> reasonably<00:00:29.820> good<00:00:29.849> filter

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
show you a a reasonably good filter

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
show you a a reasonably good filter
option<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.650> pick<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.040> any<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
option that you can pick up at any of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.830 
option that you can pick up at any of
the<00:00:32.399> Home<00:00:32.550> Depot's<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:33.090> any<00:00:33.270> other<00:00:33.360> stores<00:00:33.630> in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the Home Depot's or any other stores in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.990 
the Home Depot's or any other stores in
town<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> pleated<00:00:35.250> filter<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
town and this is a pleated filter and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
town and this is a pleated filter and
this<00:00:36.630> filters<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> reasonably<00:00:37.680> good<00:00:37.710> filter

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
this filters a reasonably good filter

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.080 
this filters a reasonably good filter
what<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> does<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> collects<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:41.160> 30%<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
what it does is it collects about 30% of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
what it does is it collects about 30% of
the<00:00:42.180> particulates<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.680> means<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the particulates so what that means to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
the particulates so what that means to
you<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> hundred<00:00:45.360> percent<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you is if I have a hundred percent of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
you is if I have a hundred percent of
dust<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.350> through<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.829> thirty<00:00:47.489> percent

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
dust going through here thirty percent

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.250 
dust going through here thirty percent
is<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.300> caught<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> filter<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is going to be caught in the filter and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920 
is going to be caught in the filter and
the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.879> 70%<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> particulates<00:00:51.660> are

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the other 70% of the particulates are

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270 
the other 70% of the particulates are
going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> continue<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> flow<00:00:52.890> through<00:00:53.160> your

a<00:00:56.879> far<00:00:57.870> far<00:00:58.170> better<00:00:58.230> option<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.520> micro<00:01:00.120> power

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

that go into this air cleaner what that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
that go into this air cleaner what that
does<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> creates<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> magnet<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.229> a

dirt is passing through this air cleaner
it's<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.600> catching<00:01:25.020> approximately<00:01:25.880> 97%

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's actually catching approximately 97%

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's actually catching approximately 97%
