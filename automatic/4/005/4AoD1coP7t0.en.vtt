00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 Now that was a package of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.429
 wine school 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.300
 hello dear people welcome 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.990
 to the next lessons of our little ones 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.080
 websites today with the topic 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.500
 flavors live in the wine 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.590
 his 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.599
 On the other hand, the content on the one hand to know the wine 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.360
 but on the other hand can be pretty 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.190
 Others silly work with what we do 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.980
 by no means mediate here today 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.900
 I want to bring a wine 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.270
 a silvaner and I give it to you 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.600
 one time and then you do it to us 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.010
 strong team mocking the spackeln 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.210
 or 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.250
 So if you ask my wife then will 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.110
 they say that they can ask but 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.260
 I know that you know I 'll do that 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:03.980
 spade splendidly fragrant after wild 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.430
 white vineyard in orange 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.330
 test thoroughly vegetable 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.970
 topinambur but also a bit floral 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:23.510
 white picked with yellow flowers 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:25.909
 acacia honey and nettle man wore 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.220
 with a lot of white currant and but 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.500
 Also cassis and earthy minutes is the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.490
 Thank goodness that sounds great 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 something like home 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.049
 dear people so please not the wine 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.490
 describe we can not prevent 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.409
 if you do that someday, but 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.600
 please do not tell her that in the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.520
 site school learned 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.110
 felix and now that you have the strong one 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.549
 have given you can now the normal 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.900
 make a lot of effort with it 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.439
 I manage that many people I think 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:00.710
 there is okay so the nice nose with hay 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.150
 and actually straw and pear altogether 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.320
 bit of citrus maybe still 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:12.560
 on the palate with a clear acidity 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.769
 but also a bit creamy relative 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.230
 slim not too punchy but he 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.570
 often long leaving students at ok thank you 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.820
 if he wanted to learn more about wine and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.770
 not only wants to watch videos then 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.590
 you have to compulsorily you 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.560
 often adopt a system like yours 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 experiences impressions cataloged 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 flavors play a big role 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.650
 Interestingly, wine is made from grapes 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.240
 but smells like all kinds 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.380
 Not for grapes if he does 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.110
 it does one more thing 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.030
 have remarkable property here 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.190
 we now have a silvaner important with it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 the flavors in silvana is for me 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 grateful example because it is not quite 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.830
 easier to drink wine 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.570
 and then often citrus flavors dominate 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.870
 and gooseberry and then there are these 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.240
 something more complex heavier type of 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 he judge so after hay and straw pear 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.250
 and apple let me guess what too liver 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.260
 max dutch and straw but I think that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.300
 other not bad now and if 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.010
 someone describes the wine then 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.410
 you can easily sort it 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.480
 exactly when I come to you in the store and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.040
 i ask i would like to have silvaner and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.140
 recommend me one then I ask you 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.850
 how tastes win and if I then 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.440
 with citrus and gooseberry 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.180
 he'll probably come from you 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.270
 They are very fast in the hay 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 and straw nice you would have a trip 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.700
 enters the load 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.620
 I like silvana did they 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.910
 also in the hay and straw so I would know 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.220
 what are you talking to experiment just 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.140
 remains to add that the flavors the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.100
 we wrote mostly only 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.510
 to draw the smell 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.130
 others still bite me 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.420
 occasional houses because of this need 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.740
 we do not like it again but we like it 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.330
 have also when drinking 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.130
 the refugees we fling through 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.400
 take the nose and therefore remember 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.630
 We are only aware of that 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.490
 there are associations last but not least 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.290
 a clear difference between at 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.740
 this wine and let's say pear juice 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 a single aroma is not 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.070
 meaningful for a wine it works 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.920
 always a nice thing about the overall package 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.709
 example of this is the riesling loud 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.140
 The textbook should smell like apricot 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.840
 and there is something in it, but there are also 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.700
 whole flavors packages then also with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.100
 a clearly defined taste profile 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.370
 some rieslings smell the same 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.440
 a whole exotic fruit basket of pineapple 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.230
 mango melon mandarin and co 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.870
 others I smell very sweet, I'll tell you 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.430
 like lena april fresh then the classic 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.420
 This Riesling with a lot of apricot 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.610
 and notes of malt and caramel 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.110
 I always do that to some people 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.520
 vanilla call me remember that always 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.140
 more so a bit of bodylotion or 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.960
 It would be great , but it does not matter 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.270
 relatively heavy sweetish scent of two 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.010
 Rieslings from the april department fresh 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.180
 may be very different 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.630
 but have more in common than one 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.520
 riesling from the apricot department as 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.230
 Department is nice thank you 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.580
 Let's get department attack and 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.250
 ten times a few white wines very fast 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.160
 flavors on common romina white wine world 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.140
 see eg peach apricot and quince 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.560
 criticism sounds again after saving 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.690
 aroma is very common and please 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.460
 maybe as an idea in glass 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.180
 Quittengelee buy and times the nose 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.070
 keep pure 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.200
 that smells pretty own and is 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.870
 pretty common in the white side 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.670
 is weiner and apple of course it 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.590
 also legitimate to differentiate so that 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.110
 what i just did people pictures 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.060
 Does he know vineyards for you, please 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.310
 knows how it smells like that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.680
 and the end of everything else is schwafel 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.740
 felix before you speak up you speak 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.260
 wanted to say something about apples some 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.810
 Weze greeks fresh and slightly after 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.860
 to say apple to green apple and 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.190
 then there are those we have this 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.240
 very heavy smell of furniture and there 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.610
 I think that's okay 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.380
 said this smells like green apple 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.690
 or one against elster and this one here 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.430
 to boscope or you even roast 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.940
 then there is still a lot 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.660
 herbs flowers and vegetables latter 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.270
 does not smell great many 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:18.240
 wine professionals also call this floral or 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:19.890
 vegetable of my favorite words but the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.810
 are tight but I think we 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.340
 make time for today yes it does 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.340
 anyway more fun that yourself 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:34.160
 you first time and see you soon 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.160
 delicious 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.949
 Hanover
