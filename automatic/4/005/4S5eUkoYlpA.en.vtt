00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone is clear 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.569
 today for a little tutorial that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.610
 will sell in my opinion to dd more than m it's 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.590
 sure how to have a static theme or 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.780
 a free dynamic theme asks for 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
 its ps3 so first of all what does that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.120
 it's a dynamic theme or nkam 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 static 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 if you've been to the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
 playstation store you will see that there are 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 a theme section I talk a little about the nose 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 sorry wants to create a kid section is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 to gain static themes or 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.590
 dynamic themes then to know that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 all dynamic themes are paying 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 there is no free eh well I'm going 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 show you how the com has 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 a few for free so that's 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 does not go mainly on the plain 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.399
 there on the ps3 it happens mostly on 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 internet and we can also have some 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 static themes of this method then 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 from below will just take you a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.449
 usb key so otherwise you will not be able 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 make 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 you can do your ps3 too 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.899
 but I do not advise you because we 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.250
 can we still get the thing 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.240
 so it's you make you go 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.700
 in the site 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.810
 sir who has inscriptions on the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 site rather you arrive on this page 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.689
 so see plague hotels.com you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 go down a little bit there you see cape and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.220
 that there are some themes and so 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.130
 imagine I find one that was not bad 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.299
 where is the wicca there is marked dynamic 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 theme is themes that are animated 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.590
 sorry frankly I leave a lot 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.790
 of ideas and I do not arrive it's the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 holidays and I'm sick like by 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.880
 chance so there is marked dynamic this is 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.500
 that when they are animated 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.090
 there is no marked dynamic 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.540
 that is to say they are static they 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 do not move then for example I 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 download a black ops theme of that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.219
 I said no playing very started for 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.689
 download it then when you have the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.110
 theme you click on it you arrive 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.870
 on the page she says 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 here 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.000
 and so where you just know to click 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.030
 on download you wait a few 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.250
 seconds and download as axis 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.330
 like here means mark a little 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.090
 meal what I already have that loads 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.390
 and instinctively that it downloads you 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.030
 take your usb key or pike in 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 your usb key or makes a folder that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:36.130
 will now be called a folder that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.870
 will be called ps3 in this ps3 folder you 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.140
 will create another folder where the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.230
 peoples 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.920
 he was pointing out themes like those 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.410
 has uppercase without s is in this 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.490
 folder so just you 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.220
 go take the themes you need 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.190
 look no by the way of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.560
 blackhawks 2 overboard under the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.720
 foliage a desire not against him 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.360
 statutes I believe that leaves me 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.830
 static term 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.830
 or nothing when I downloaded these 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.239
 dynamic style ranges like this 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.370
 so you just have each time 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.330
 clicked on to download and get 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.480
 will download all alone 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:24.400
 so you have not too much it's not too much 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.280
 complicated play earlier so there he 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 marked ali m video for example turns out 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.580
 it's a video 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.910
 it's not yesterday that it's a video 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.200
 who passes so I'm going to download 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.620
 to show what will it look like on the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.620
 ps3 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.220
 parents top1 you take style range 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.080
 and you put them in your folder 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.740
 thermal and the fashion of these ps3 which in 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.260
 your usb key 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.100
 but you see there are weird names 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.480
 during their marks and blocks 2 do 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.340
 you do not like the plugging 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.620
 your ps3 that you're going to put it in 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 your ps3 he simply notice 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.200
 black ops from google named style so no 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.790
 to reject the charges and then goes off 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 there yes there is hd sd so if you have a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.620
 hd tv or download it 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.900
 if you have a field that lisa stay 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.400
 you download it help them then me 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.530
 seeing that I have two belgians is everything 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.080
 just a first time like that 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.960
 when I change TV finally I 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.090
 Plasmas will pest to change TV 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.880
 there is simply one day both 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.800
 so here in this case I just want to 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.580
 put the sd because I am trying 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.580
 usb management 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.380
 so see there on the side you have 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.950
 full of two categories of glaoui theme 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.800
 illogical 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.610
 it's a whole category there is that 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.610
 such dynamic 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.610
 assassin's creed for example if you 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.310
 I do not want too much woman sent to full 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.460
 of stuff so especially times on the ps3 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.580
 to show how it works at everything from 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.580
 after 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.700
 now let's go to the door and ps3 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.350
 as you can see it's pretty simple 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.190
 just go to the settings 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.560
 and then go thyme settings or 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.750
 clicked on theme and on install who 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.919
 is above 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.919
 then you free it's your usb key 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.720
 and there you have the themes that you have 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.250
 previously downloaded issued in the key 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.890
 usb 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.180
 so do not move or take for example 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.220
 white like sir does you have 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.260
 downloaded from one by which you press 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.260
 on validate of course you press 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.980
 wii and as you will see there is 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.350
 it will register 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.510
 I'm going to fall back on theme is in 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.790
 below you have the themes that are 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.550
 appeared or the shrink for example never 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.920
 I activate the gangnam style theme you 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.630
 see that the terrain is activated and 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.290
 it's a dynamic theme as the theme 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:03.030
 move i'll stay looking at black 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.830
 ops me because I prefer so voila 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.020
 you no longer have this tutorial 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.030
 really very simplistic thank you 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.950
 to have followed it I would like the 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.330
 next do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.600
 liker or any other action that is a 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.600
 rap
