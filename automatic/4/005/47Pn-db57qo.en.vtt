00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.330
 they thought I forgot but did some 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.370
 weeks I had promised to make a 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.250
 accompaniment to the grill chosen by 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.610

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.340

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.850
 carlos velasco doubt 84 gastón rivarola 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.820
 the gift gabo 1 Augustin duke them 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.739
 They said to do something with sweetbreads 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.989
 so today I'm going to surprise you with 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.900
 a backpack fills the grill a 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.600
 Beauty that says we're going to do it 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.930
 the recipe has smoked bacon cheese 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.620
 Sardinian white wine salt black pepper 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.390
 Metallized paper and heart gizzard 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.180
 look, look what are these 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.850
 beautiful beef gizzard there are two 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.799
 types are the heart and the gizzard 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.900
 throat we have today we 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.470
 is the heart that comes to be the most 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.420
 rich because it has more fat by 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.420
 outside and inside 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.040
 tasty and also much much more 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 ground when we cook it on the grill 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.909
 I recommend that when you go to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.549
 butcher ask for gizzard of the heart 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.100
 the throats sometimes can get 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.860
 to go out a little hard or not so tasty 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.560
 so butcher tell him friend to get out 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.780
 lavalleja of heart wants we have 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.119
 our tromén well lit for 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.130
 cooking the sweetbreads has to be to 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.020
 medium fire 8 seconds has to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.310
 hold your hand above the irons 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 there we are going to put it 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.020
 calculate around 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.020
 22 minutes per side 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.470
 we accommodate the councils well 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 you have to do them with patience so that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.140
 come out creamy like with the last 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.409
 and after 20 minutes we give them 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.230
 back and there we put the bacon that 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.260
 we cut into finite veins it 's like that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.810
 and turn five minutes total cooking 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.939
 and then we take it out we have it well 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.280
 grogan of the bacon and now we are going to 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.170
 apply and we're going to add it to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.620
 our salty cheese that we already have 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.620
 grated 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.890
 nothing cuter than the moment of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.810
 chopped traditional in all roasted the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.810
 previous salute can not miss 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.140
 to pee boys 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.140
 Y 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.269
 we have the gizzard and list what 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.060
 let's do now let's open it by 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.470
 center 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.190
 there 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.190
 once 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.480
 of what he said well we want to live 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.250
 a little black pepper 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 did not leave anything else salt because I want to 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 the bacon already has enough to speak for 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 yes 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.180
 my hand allows it 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.430
 full 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.190
 you 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.190
 and flavors 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.819
 and we close it 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.019
 same 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.019
 we close by the sides 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.819
 we form a huevitos style and this 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.819
 we add 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.980
 yórvit or white wine 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.610
 this is afterwards going to be reduced within 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 grill everything for alcohol and everything 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.870
 will absorb the music then it will 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.510
 have a lot more flavor and apart from leaving 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.340
 much more tender 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.740
 and having this has returned to the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.740
 chin for about 15 years 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.840

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.410
