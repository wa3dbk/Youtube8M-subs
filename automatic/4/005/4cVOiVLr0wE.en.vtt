00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
over so you can only use it for that not

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.779 
over so you can only use it for that not
but<00:04:35.660> that's<00:04:35.870> not<00:04:36.470> too<00:04:36.680> important<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> just

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
but that's not too important so I just

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.700 
but that's not too important so I just
cut<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.180> for<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.360> little<00:04:38.449> bit<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:39.470> is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
cut it there for a little bit this is

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.930 
cut it there for a little bit this is
actually<00:04:39.979> going<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> be<00:04:40.190> all<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.550> locations

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
secret room it was so easy like if I had

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.279 
secret room it was so easy like if I had
a<00:04:45.919> baby<00:04:46.160> sister<00:04:46.520> she<00:04:47.300> could<00:04:47.449> figure<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.990> out<00:04:48.110> in

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
a baby sister she could figure it out in

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.170

like<00:05:03.410> okay<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.070> i<00:05:04.100> spawned<00:05:04.520> in<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.090> the

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.879 
like okay so i spawned in the in the
room<00:05:05.360> where<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.630> door<00:05:05.780> opens<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.500> seem<00:05:06.710> to

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
room where the door opens and I seem to

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.980 
room where the door opens and I seem to
big<00:05:07.130> doors<00:05:07.340> connected<00:05:07.789> so<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.360> was<00:05:08.570> like<00:05:08.690> okay

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
big doors connected so I was like okay

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.840 
big doors connected so I was like okay
this<00:05:09.020> could<00:05:09.320> be<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.039> went<00:05:10.400> over<00:05:10.550> there

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
this could be it so I went over there

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.640 
this could be it so I went over there
and<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:11.120> try<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.330> see<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.690> had<00:05:12.110> like<00:05:12.229> an<00:05:12.380> X<00:05:12.560> button

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
and I try to see it had like an X button

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.710 
and I try to see it had like an X button
to<00:05:13.220> open<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.460> door<00:05:13.669> or<00:05:13.699> something<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.570> did

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
to open the door or something and it did

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.629 
to open the door or something and it did
it<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.199> I<00:05:15.229> was<00:05:15.440> moving<00:05:15.680> left<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.100> right<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.520> as

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
it so I was moving left and right and as

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.810 
it so I was moving left and right and as
I<00:05:16.789> moved<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.090> my<00:05:17.240> left<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:17.810> actually<00:05:18.740> saw<00:05:19.490> an<00:05:19.639> X

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
I moved to my left I actually saw an X

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.250 
I moved to my left I actually saw an X
button<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:20.539> was<00:05:20.630> like<00:05:20.720> what<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.840> heck<00:05:21.080> and

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
button and I was like what the heck and

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.050 
button and I was like what the heck and
I<00:05:21.320> read<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.830> I<00:05:22.070> said<00:05:22.130> flip<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.580> torch<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.030> I

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
I read it and I said flip the torch so I

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.089 
I read it and I said flip the torch so I
would<00:05:23.270> assume<00:05:23.360> me<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.870> was<00:05:24.440> assuming<00:05:24.830> that

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
would assume me I was assuming that

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.080 
would assume me I was assuming that
there<00:05:25.220> was<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> lot<00:05:25.550> more<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.789> these<00:05:25.910> and

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
there was a lot more of these and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.700 
there was a lot more of these and
they're<00:05:26.720> worth<00:05:26.870> there's<00:05:27.110> only<00:05:27.229> three<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.530> them

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
they're worth there's only three of them

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.710 
they're worth there's only three of them
so<00:05:28.160> hopefully<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:28.699> guys<00:05:28.789> now<00:05:29.330> know<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
so hopefully you guys now know the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.279 
so hopefully you guys now know the
locations<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:31.400> open<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:31.699> thing<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.419> not<00:05:33.139> only

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
locations to open this thing so not only

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.570 
locations to open this thing so not only
is<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:33.590> going<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.860> give<00:05:33.979> you<00:05:34.099> support

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
is it going to give you support

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.010 
is it going to give you support
killstreaks<00:05:34.910> but<00:05:35.449> actually<00:05:35.750> gives<00:05:35.900> you

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
killstreaks but actually gives you

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.500 
killstreaks but actually gives you
lethal<00:05:36.440> actually<00:05:37.070> got<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.400> low<00:05:37.699> key<00:05:37.940> off<00:05:38.120> of

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
lethal actually got a low key off of

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.150 
lethal actually got a low key off of
this<00:05:38.660> so<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:38.960> was<00:05:39.110> pretty<00:05:39.260> awesome<00:05:39.440> so

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
this so it was pretty awesome so

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.279 
this so it was pretty awesome so
sometimes<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:41.240> will<00:05:41.389> be<00:05:41.539> worth<00:05:41.780> going<00:05:42.229> into

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
sometimes it will be worth going into

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.560 
sometimes it will be worth going into
the<00:05:42.500> room<00:05:42.830> sometimes<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.909> won't<00:05:44.180> be<00:05:44.330> worth

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
the room sometimes it won't be worth

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.839 
the room sometimes it won't be worth
going<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.110> at<00:05:45.289> all<00:05:45.530> because<00:05:46.070> he<00:05:46.340> knows<00:05:46.490> who

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
going in at all because he knows who

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.600 
going in at all because he knows who
wants<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.330> ammo<00:05:47.539> crate<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.289> certainly<00:05:49.220> do<00:05:49.490> not

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
wants a ammo crate I certainly do not

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.700 
wants a ammo crate I certainly do not
but<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:50.090> mean<00:05:50.389> it<00:05:50.510> comes<00:05:50.930> in<00:05:51.169> handy<00:05:51.380> at<00:05:51.650> times

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710

and you know just me burning meanwhile
you<00:06:09.979> know<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.280> was<00:06:10.669> trying<00:06:10.849> to<00:06:10.909> do<00:06:11.030> this<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:11.510> that

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
you know I was trying to do this so that

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.110 
you know I was trying to do this so that
actually<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.430> think<00:06:13.550> you<00:06:13.760> don't<00:06:13.880> even<00:06:13.940> have

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
actually I think you don't even have

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.689 
actually I think you don't even have
about<00:06:14.449> five<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.320> six<00:06:15.560> seconds<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.340> actually

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
about five to six seconds to actually
