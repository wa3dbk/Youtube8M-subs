commentary<00:00:04.770> we're<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> be<00:00:05.160> talking

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
commentary we're going to be talking

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.880 
commentary we're going to be talking
about<00:00:05.400> elimination<00:00:06.120> chamber<00:00:06.470> 2013<00:00:07.470> we're

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about elimination chamber 2013 we're

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
about elimination chamber 2013 we're
gonna<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.069> talking<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.429> new<00:00:08.490> match<00:00:08.730> that

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
gonna be talking about a new match that

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.580 
gonna be talking about a new match that
was<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.210> added<00:00:09.630> today<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> actually

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
was just added today that I actually

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.410 
was just added today that I actually
thought<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.670> happen<00:00:11.759> that's<00:00:12.269> why<00:00:12.389> I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
thought was going to happen that's why I

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.209 
thought was going to happen that's why I
actually<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.410> recycles<00:00:13.920> footage

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
actually have this recycles footage

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.709 
actually have this recycles footage
because<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.790> never<00:00:15.030> announced<00:00:15.360> his<00:00:15.540> match

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
because they never announced his match

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.050 
because they never announced his match
but<00:00:16.080> um<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.740> always<00:00:17.699> thought<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> was

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but um I always thought that it was

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.849 
but um I always thought that it was
going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> happen<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.840> gonna<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.020> Miz<00:00:19.410> vs

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
going to happen so it's gonna be Miz vs

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to happen so it's gonna be Miz vs
azzaro<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> United<00:00:20.760> States

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
azzaro for the United States

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.599 
azzaro for the United States
Championship<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.100> two<00:00:23.160> cents

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
Championship and here is my two cents

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
Championship and here is my two cents
about<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.180> um<00:00:24.720> something<00:00:25.439> tells<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
about it um something tells me that the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
about it um something tells me that the
maze<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> actually<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.029> win<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.330> time

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
maze is actually going to win this time

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
maze is actually going to win this time
the<00:00:27.960> maze<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> win<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> become<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the maze is going to win and become the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.209 
the maze is going to win and become the
United<00:00:29.789> States<00:00:29.939> Champion<00:00:30.539> um<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> something

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
United States Champion um and something

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
United States Champion um and something
that<00:00:32.369> makes<00:00:33.210> me<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.960> because

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that makes me think that way is because

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.790 
that makes me think that way is because
of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.160> whole<00:00:35.430> momentum<00:00:36.180> theory<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> have

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
of the whole momentum theory that I have

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
of the whole momentum theory that I have
usually<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> w/e<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.480> theory

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
usually with the w/e and this theory

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
usually with the w/e and this theory
always<00:00:40.379> works<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.800> sixty<00:00:41.219> percent<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
always works about sixty percent of the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.110 
always works about sixty percent of the
time<00:00:42.540> um<00:00:43.399> basically<00:00:44.870> how<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.989> say<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.230> um

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
time um basically how do I say this um

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
time um basically how do I say this um
the<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> most<00:00:48.690> momentum<00:00:49.350> always

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the one with the most momentum always

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
the one with the most momentum always
ends<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> losing<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.360> theory

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
ends up kind of losing that is my theory

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
ends up kind of losing that is my theory
um<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.100> heading<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> paper<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
um the one heading to the paper you with

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
um the one heading to the paper you with
a<00:00:54.360> most<00:00:54.570> momentum<00:00:54.989> always<00:00:55.320> ends<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.620> losing

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a most momentum always ends up losing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.340 
a most momentum always ends up losing
sometimes<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.699> mean<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.539> look<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:58.199> at

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
sometimes I mean if we look at look at

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
sometimes I mean if we look at look at
it<00:00:58.500> let's<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> Wrestlemania<00:00:59.219> 24<00:01:00.030> um<00:01:00.300> edge

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it let's go to Wrestlemania 24 um edge

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.910 
it let's go to Wrestlemania 24 um edge
kept<00:01:01.440> attacking<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.039> Undertaker<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.920> edge

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
kept attacking the Undertaker and edge

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.000 
kept attacking the Undertaker and edge
loss<00:01:05.250> um<00:01:06.180> what's<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
loss um what's one that I could think of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.359 
loss um what's one that I could think of
okay<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> TLC<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.330> Undertaker<00:01:09.780> kept<00:01:10.369> having

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
okay the TLC the Undertaker kept having

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.969 
okay the TLC the Undertaker kept having
the<00:01:11.460> most<00:01:11.580> momentum<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.479> Extreme<00:01:12.630> Rules<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the most momentum at Extreme Rules in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.320 
the most momentum at Extreme Rules in
the<00:01:14.189> TLC<00:01:14.520> match<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.210> edge<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.979> um

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the TLC match he had with edge and um

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
the TLC match he had with edge and um
edge<00:01:18.330> loss<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> momentum<00:01:19.710> theory<00:01:19.920> if

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
edge loss it's like a momentum theory if

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.320 
edge loss it's like a momentum theory if
you<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.280> about<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> moment<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you think about it and at the moment it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.280 
you think about it and at the moment it
looks<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.570> she's<00:01:21.720> our<00:01:21.840> eyes<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> most

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
looks like she's our eyes the most

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
looks like she's our eyes the most
momentum<00:01:22.860> after<00:01:23.250> attacking<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.210> raw

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
momentum after attacking them is at raw

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
momentum after attacking them is at raw
so<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.950> doesn't<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> Miz<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so something doesn't that the Miz is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
so something doesn't that the Miz is
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> win<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> feel<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
going to win and what I feel about how I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
going to win and what I feel about how I
feel<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.579> um<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.509> don't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
feel about it is actually um I don't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
feel about it is actually um I don't
really<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> mean<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.030> was<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> great

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really know I mean that was a great

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
really know I mean that was a great
champion<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.409> maybe<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:35.130> lead<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
champion but maybe this could lead to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
champion but maybe this could lead to
bigger<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.850> better<00:01:35.970> things<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.600> him<00:01:37.049> um

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
bigger and better things for him um

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
bigger and better things for him um
hopefully<00:01:38.430> WB<00:01:39.090> doesn't<00:01:39.329> screw<00:01:39.509> him<00:01:39.659> up

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
hopefully WB doesn't screw him up

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.550 
hopefully WB doesn't screw him up
because<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.200> honestly<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.009> um<00:01:42.560> Cesaro

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
because I honestly think that um Cesaro

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.310 
because I honestly think that um Cesaro
is<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> uh<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.360> mean<00:01:45.869> lose<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
is going to uh when I mean lose the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.170 
is going to uh when I mean lose the
championship<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> Elimination

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
championship up at the Elimination

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.460 
championship up at the Elimination
Chamber<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.570> sorry<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.079> tired

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
Chamber and I'm sorry because I'm tired

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
Chamber and I'm sorry because I'm tired
my<00:01:49.770> eyes<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.220> killing<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
my eyes are just killing me at the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.870 
my eyes are just killing me at the
moment<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.500> um<00:01:52.799> yeah<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.729> little

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
moment but um yeah that's my little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
moment but um yeah that's my little
theory<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> whole<00:01:55.439> WEP

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
theory i have about the whole WEP

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
theory i have about the whole WEP
pay-per-view<00:01:56.909> thing<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> look<00:01:58.409> at

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
pay-per-view thing and you can look at

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.289 
pay-per-view thing and you can look at
it<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:59.100> paper<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.520> sometimes<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.149> with

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it at some paper you sometimes get with

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.539 
it at some paper you sometimes get with
the<00:02:00.390> most<00:02:00.570> momentum<00:02:01.110> ended<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.680> still<00:02:02.130> winning

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the most momentum ended up still winning

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
the most momentum ended up still winning
but<00:02:02.930> usually<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.200> never<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.860> way<00:02:05.460> um<00:02:06.590> what

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
but usually it's never that way um what

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
but usually it's never that way um what
an<00:02:07.710> example<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.340> recent<00:02:08.369> example<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.270> think

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
an example a recent example i can think

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.900 
an example a recent example i can think
of<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:09.869> okay<00:02:10.709> let's<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> CM<00:02:11.640> Punk

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
of maybe okay let's look at the CM Punk

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
of maybe okay let's look at the CM Punk
in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> rock<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.750> remember

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
in the rock thing remember

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.960 
in the rock thing remember
she<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.770> pump<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> most<00:02:14.460> momentum

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
she and pump had the most momentum

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.940 
she and pump had the most momentum
heading<00:02:15.180> into<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.900> Royal<00:02:16.200> Rumble<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
heading into the Royal Rumble and the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
heading into the Royal Rumble and the
rock<00:02:17.130> ended<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.520> winning<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.570> whole

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
rock ended up winning it's this whole

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.930 
rock ended up winning it's this whole
momentum<00:02:19.050> theory<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.460> know<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.700> have

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
momentum theory and you know I have

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
momentum theory and you know I have
evidence<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.480> backs<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.350> most<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
evidence that backs it up most of the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.980 
evidence that backs it up most of the
time<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.570> what<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.960> guys

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
time but I want to know what you guys

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.540 
time but I want to know what you guys
think<00:02:25.320> about<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.620> do<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.130> Cesaro<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
think about this do you want Cesaro to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.800 
think about this do you want Cesaro to
win<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.820> want<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.390> win<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:27.660> i

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
win do you want them is to win because i

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.150 
win do you want them is to win because i
think<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> miz<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.500> going<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.830> win<00:02:28.980> but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
think that the miz is going to win but

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
think that the miz is going to win but
if<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.460> not<00:02:29.760> Cesaro<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.690> going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> win<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
if it not Cesaro is going to win and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.170 
if it not Cesaro is going to win and
that's<00:02:31.650> still<00:02:31.980> pretty<00:02:32.070> cool<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.550> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
that's still pretty cool because this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.990 
that's still pretty cool because this
match<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:35.130> match<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.580> benefit

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
match can have this match can benefit

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900 
match can have this match can benefit
the<00:02:36.150> both<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:37.250> zaro<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.490> move<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the both in a way zaro can move on to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.370 
the both in a way zaro can move on to
bigger<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.180> better<00:02:39.300> things<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.020> miss<00:02:40.200> could

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
bigger and better things and miss could

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.160 
bigger and better things and miss could
win<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> championship<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.760> um<00:02:41.940> yeah<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.750> full

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
win a championship but um yeah the full

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.190 
win a championship but um yeah the full
gameplay<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.980> match<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.790> um<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.720> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
gameplay to this match is not um in this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
gameplay to this match is not um in this
video<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.770> uh<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.090> count<00:02:48.420> glitch

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
video because uh the one count glitch

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.050 
video because uh the one count glitch
you<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.260> i<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.680> i<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.250> kept<00:02:50.520> attacking<00:02:50.640> him

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you know i was i just kept attacking him

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
you know i was i just kept attacking him
and<00:02:51.150> he<00:02:51.209> kept<00:02:51.420> kicking<00:02:51.600> out<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.650> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and he kept kicking out at one and you

and he kept kicking out at one and you
know<00:02:53.459> i<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.880> thought<00:02:54.180> i<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:54.840> bout<00:02:55.410> was
