00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 what people call my name 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.110
 personally welcome 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
 there is a video of me and today 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 for once, no video with cam 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 but without because I have the consequence 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 plays it is a really cool game 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 what a game probably with the future 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 is denner haha the game also plays in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.960
 the future wortwitz to be able to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.560
 I hope I can do that again 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 with the time pressure 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.710
 everything is good every softrocker but that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 you all know 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.950
 So please do not pull too much else 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.379
 you end so i hope that we have one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780
 little warning was natural for you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 it definitely that again today 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.379
 without a cam that they actually from me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 not used and it sounds certain 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 funny suit without being chemically videos 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 to be seen by me, however, with such a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.079
 video I do not want the camp necessarily 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.750
 while for who I must say that it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 for many many important things there are 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 One can mention and the camp would be me 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 only disturb if you are inviting from 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.210
 Of course you want to see it before the game 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 gm 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.700
 then the thumb gets down then 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.479
 I will definitely net comment 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 and yes I am glad that I am mine 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 By the way, that's the first game here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.549
 my first round not with a live 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 provided comments because that was 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.869
 pretty embarrassing because I have 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.369
 I was always proud of myself 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 this whole amount of coal 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.970
 although that's not a real player 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 are really only let millions 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.329
 and it has to be clear the asset 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 Do not look at me like hell 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 they are that it was totally clear that it was here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 Munich are but I was natural 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 proud of it and me according to the motto 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 so close is if I'm under pro on every one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.100
 case of the type on the wall I viewed 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.759
 my from the moment I would have understood that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.770
 have to be 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 All right, I'll tell you in any case 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 a little bit of the story like it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 started with the game with me 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.430
 I have the game in the beginning 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.570
 played and I have with the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 Training mode started like that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 Most of course, and that's one 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.700
 pilot training mode if I mean 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.329
 even my god are the bad and me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.799
 good was also my god no luck 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.399
 because it is money gold race and i would have 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.350
 embarrassed me 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.119
 In any case, I have the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.619
 training mode played at the beginning and there 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.869
 will explain what you do 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 By the way, I can also record 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.959
 However, my sound recording was 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 not recorded and well there I stood 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.950
 At the end I thought so easy 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.330
 asks why was this not recorded 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.250
 and here , by the way , I got here once 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.989
 money definitely a training mode 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.400
 is shown you can very many 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.890
 Things really do the skill 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 I am based and looking for a game like this 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.700
 also really because you can over 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530
 make use of run up 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 you can do a double jump 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.400
 and here comes at cold angefllogen 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
 really cool that stacy gets in moderate 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.120
 from there we will be explained how 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.590
 The whole thing will work 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.569
 I'll explain everything we have right away 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.280
 still a little bit of time nevertheless very much 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.510
 long even in any case I have the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.489
 Training mode is played and thinking 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.959
 really 20 minutes if you learn the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.530
 Last one wants to see again 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.560
 Thumbs up 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.819
 In any case, I will, yes, we 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.230
 definitely have the trouble 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.700
 make and mix the tea again or 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 play even though I played a goalie 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.060
 I hope that will work 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.629
 he plays the two times but me 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.040
 I think so 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.599
 In any case, now we can 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.090
 her two children and that's it 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.680
 really cool what that part of everything 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.360
 can explain which and equal 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.170
 why I think that the game is based 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.580
 For one thing, you can really apply it 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.409
 run high and so on and so forth 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.170
 you can do very many things 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.730
 they are not that easy and 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.739
 You really have to do that very many 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.950
 Focusing things and after two minutes 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.230
 the gameplay is in the click one then 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.209
 sent a tighten and everyone has 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.129
 his own pages and every channel 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.799
 can then be in his own pages 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.239
 be thinner and you see you said me 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.239
 get sometimes days have own 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.690
 after I have killed the minions 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.930
 have 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.879
 and yes only did count because that is 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.670
 on water opponents then not that you 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.890
 you ask very well so no that is 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.360
 only mini and so I have a little there 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.360
 per played i was at the beginning i am 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.310
 fully good but yes i have german 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.439
 let's be good in any case we can 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.610
 Of course, you shoot normally 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.409
 you just then we can rocket 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.549
 fire and a sign should 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.410
 We start with the normal 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.570
 shoot at the normal shooting 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.280
 mutates very easily and that one man 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.100
 simply by simply pressing the button to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.519
 shoot normal acting is pretty 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.980
 easy and so we can do one 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.310
 open shield and that is that 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.950
 sign 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.460
 it does not matter how the opponents are 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.580
 he attacks us he absorbs his 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.980
 ammunition and shoot back at him 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.440
 and of course not permanently 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.090
 are used so you have it 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.710
 Use it properly so you do not 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.120
 which mistakes do it make? 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.910
 always take a while to get it back 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.380
 can use after the shield 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.690
 By the way, we can also rocket 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940
 but they also absorb 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.380
 can be from the shield and the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.360
 were then shot back again 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.860
 So you have to pay a little attention 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.300
 when had a sign against it 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.490
 activated and when should you 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.170
 missile defense call the missiles are 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.430
 what does the most harm and 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.230
 Here you see, there is also one 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.690
 melee and shoot the lantern 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.280
 or the lantern or an resp 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.170
 no idea what is a merchandise 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.170
 or even if she can not help it 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.020
 a similar page and should i 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.060
 is destroyed again 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.060
 He does not remember what I think 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.360
 but I am one catching you 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.240
 business hours 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.130
 I remain a team so definitely 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.190
 there is a button if you go down 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.700
 I just pushed her down 60 I got in 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.190
 the time where money wants its course 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.110
 I could say so when I'm on 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.060
 a little bit stronger and do more harm like that 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.980
 At least I heard it and now 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.360
 I know a few more - and as I said 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.830
 I thought in the beginning that would be normal 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.520
 people but no they are not normal 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.140
 people because yes they are in any case 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.910
 nominated and yet remains one sees 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.470
 nothing to imagine when the cold so 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.419
 Now again, do not blame it as well as all 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.710
 balls and shoot them back I know 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.969
 not at all if he hit the bullets 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.739
 because 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.750
 I think he was not in anymore 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:03.670
 So exceptional in 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.440
 he was not close enough to that the 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.750
 children should meet again but good 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.430
 In any case, I do not know 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.830
 who played the spielchen of you 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.360
 Of course, the ps4 have one 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.470
 big problem because the game will be 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.990
 do not give up on the psp 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.150
 the game is then only on the pc 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.270
 and on the xbox one 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.680
 So it's an exclusive title for both 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.840
 although that's the way to do it 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.930
 do not call because yes there are also 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.820
 two consoles only on the ps4 not on 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.900
 in any case, if you are the exporters me 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.370
 you can do it quietly on the pc 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.490
 play and that was really cool right now 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.630
 I think although it was lucky 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.080
 every case what is your opinion about 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.570
 game 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.730
 and what would interest me what 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.460
 Do you think who the game is the most so 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.740
 it ends most call of duty is on 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.010
 Most halo by the way, too 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.780
 Exclusive to the xbox one is or ends 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.740
 it's the most battlefield 4 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.919
 you can do that in the comments 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.870
 Write and now I still wanted to 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.520
 But what do I say that? 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.970
 bit planned due because it gives me 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.440
 another 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.540
 won in any case well now me 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.950
