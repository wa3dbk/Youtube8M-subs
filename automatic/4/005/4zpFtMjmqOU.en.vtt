00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
can get it right now but maybe at some

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.900 
can get it right now but maybe at some
point<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.390> future<00:04:45.430> let's<00:04:46.430> see<00:04:46.640> what<00:04:46.820> else

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.530 
missing ones 56 drug pride 56 drug pride
too<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.140> it's<00:05:10.380> not<00:05:10.530> showing<00:05:10.800> up

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.940 

pretty<00:05:16.780> cool<00:05:16.930> looks<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.530> they<00:05:17.650> have<00:05:17.680> some

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
pretty cool looks like they have some

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.850 
pretty cool looks like they have some
polishing<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.520> do<00:05:18.670> on<00:05:18.820> some<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.470> sets<00:05:20.470> that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
polishing to do on some of the sets that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.590 
polishing to do on some of the sets that
they<00:05:20.980> got<00:05:21.130> there<00:05:21.570> but<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.190> useful<00:05:24.480> here<00:05:25.480> we

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
they got there but it is useful here we

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.780 
they got there but it is useful here we
can<00:05:25.720> clear<00:05:25.900> all<00:05:26.050> our<00:05:26.230> filters<00:05:26.620> back<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.550> seeing

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
can clear all our filters back to seeing

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.550 
can clear all our filters back to seeing
all<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.060> our<00:05:28.390> things<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:31.170> another<00:05:32.170> thing<00:05:32.410> is

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
all of our things and another thing is

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.520 
all of our things and another thing is
it's<00:05:33.010> cool<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.790> could<00:05:33.970> distribute<00:05:34.810> items

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
it's cool you could distribute items

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.470 
it's cool you could distribute items
evenly<00:05:36.070> among<00:05:36.490> all<00:05:36.730> three<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.270> your

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
evenly among all three of your

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.720 
evenly among all three of your
characters<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.590> here's<00:05:38.860> my<00:05:38.920> heavy<00:05:39.460> ammo

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
characters like here's my heavy ammo

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.600 
characters like here's my heavy ammo
synthesis<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:40.600> go<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.840> extras<00:05:41.350> I<00:05:41.590> could<00:05:42.400> say

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
synthesis I go to extras I could say

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.210 
synthesis I go to extras I could say
normalize<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.720> that's<00:05:44.380> going<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.590> normalize

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
normalize and that's going to normalize

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.080 
normalize and that's going to normalize
my<00:05:45.510> 244<00:05:46.510> heavy<00:05:46.930> ammo<00:05:47.350> packs<00:05:47.670> amongst<00:05:48.670> my<00:05:48.820> three

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
my 244 heavy ammo packs amongst my three

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.660 
my 244 heavy ammo packs amongst my three
characters<00:05:50.760> now<00:05:51.870> do<00:05:52.870> all<00:05:53.290> items<00:05:54.100> normalized

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
characters now do all items normalized

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.070 
characters now do all items normalized
now<00:05:55.560> they're<00:05:56.560> equally<00:05:57.420> distributed<00:05:58.420> among<00:05:58.870> my

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
now they're equally distributed among my

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.270 
now they're equally distributed among my
three<00:05:59.260> characters<00:05:59.770> so<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.040> could<00:06:00.160> do<00:06:00.250> that

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
three characters so you could do that

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.060 
three characters so you could do that
with<00:06:00.430> all<00:06:00.820> of<00:06:01.000> your<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:02.140> know<00:06:02.230> materials<00:06:02.830> and

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
with all of your you know materials and

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.670 
with all of your you know materials and
stuff<00:06:03.340> or<00:06:03.790> heavy<00:06:04.270> ammo<00:06:04.660> packs<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.260> just<00:06:05.470> makes

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
stuff or heavy ammo packs it just makes

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.890 
stuff or heavy ammo packs it just makes
it<00:06:05.770> easy<00:06:06.070> spread<00:06:07.030> things<00:06:07.240> out<00:06:07.450> like<00:06:07.750> your

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
it easy spread things out like your

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.450 
it easy spread things out like your
strange<00:06:08.230> coins<00:06:09.270> normalize<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:10.690> a<00:06:11.080> little

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
strange coins normalize and a little

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.070 
strange coins normalize and a little
evenly<00:06:12.460> distribute<00:06:13.300> them<00:06:13.510> throughout<00:06:13.540> your

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
evenly distribute them throughout your

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.900 
evenly distribute them throughout your
characters<00:06:15.000> pretty<00:06:16.000> cool
