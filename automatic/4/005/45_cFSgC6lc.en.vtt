00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:30.410 

in<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.920> next<00:01:22.130> section<00:01:22.369> goes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:47.740 

Nantz

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:01.990 

in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.900> next<00:01:49.200> section

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.840 

I<00:02:02.030> don't<00:02:02.960> know<00:02:03.050> if<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.230> can<00:02:03.350> see<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.640> goes

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
I don't know if you can see this so goes

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.410 
I don't know if you can see this so goes

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
e-string four and then two on the D

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.570 
e-string four and then two on the D
string<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:14.830> then<00:02:15.830> four<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.280> open<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:18.580> then

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
string and then four to open and then

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
string and then four to open and then
two<00:02:20.540> four<00:02:20.780> five<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:24.200> then<00:02:24.260> for<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.680> open<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
two four five and then for to open and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
two four five and then for to open and
then<00:02:27.650> use<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.610> next<00:02:28.790> part

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:48.520 

so<00:02:38.360> girls<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.780> this

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.230 

I<00:02:50.980> don't<00:02:51.980> know<00:02:52.070> if<00:02:52.190> he<00:02:52.280> does<00:02:52.460> a<00:02:52.490> harmonic<00:02:53.060> on

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
I don't know if he does a harmonic on

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.620 
I don't know if he does a harmonic on
those<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:54.200> think<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.440> sounds<00:02:54.680> better<00:02:55.630> next

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
those I just think it sounds better next

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:17.050 
those I just think it sounds better next
part<00:02:56.930> that's<00:03:01.450> good

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.839 

so<00:03:17.900> slow

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:44.750 

next<00:03:26.849> for

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:57.930 

that<00:03:45.760> slow<00:03:46.150> goes

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:26.770 

I<00:03:57.970> mean<00:03:58.810> else<00:03:58.960> I<00:03:59.080> play<00:03:59.260> there<00:04:04.770> Yeager's

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.060 

that's<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.960> 2<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.830> then<00:04:29.700> pull<00:04:30.060> up<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.270> open<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
that's a 2 and then pull up to open and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.600 
that's a 2 and then pull up to open and
then<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.610> slide<00:04:33.090> up<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.360> 7<00:04:35.360> then<00:04:36.360> ends<00:04:36.720> on<00:04:36.870> 5<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
then to slide up to 7 then ends on 5 and

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.760 
then to slide up to 7 then ends on 5 and
the<00:04:38.730> next<00:04:38.940> part<00:04:39.150> goes<00:04:39.750> like<00:04:39.900> this<00:04:40.080> that's<00:04:40.650> an

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
the next part goes like this that's an

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:52.540 
the next part goes like this that's an
open<00:04:41.010> note<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:42.000> g<00:04:42.450> string

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:06.850 

so<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.730> goes

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.309 

then<00:05:07.860> this<00:05:07.979> last<00:05:08.189> part<00:05:08.490> such<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.389> open<00:05:09.930> on<00:05:10.139> the

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
then this last part such as open on the

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.459 
then this last part such as open on the
B<00:05:10.530> string<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:11.099> then<00:05:11.849> starts<00:05:12.569> with<00:05:12.689> two<00:05:12.960> three

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
B string and then starts with two three

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:21.800 
B string and then starts with two three
on<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.740> Asian<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:17.030> then<00:05:18.030> one<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.569> the<00:05:18.689> beach

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:37.300 

number<00:05:22.650> three<00:05:22.860> on<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.100> vision

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.540 

so<00:05:38.210> this<00:05:38.390> one<00:05:38.630> part<00:05:38.870> where<00:05:39.200> it<00:05:39.290> goes<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:42.550> think

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
so this one part where it goes I think

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.930 
so this one part where it goes I think
it's<00:05:43.670> supposed<00:05:43.790> to<00:05:43.970> be<00:05:44.090> played<00:05:44.890> like<00:05:45.890> open<00:05:46.820> on

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
it's supposed to be played like open on

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.530 
it's supposed to be played like open on
the<00:05:47.060> B<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.660> then<00:05:48.650> you<00:05:48.680> do<00:05:48.920> to<00:05:49.310> pull<00:05:50.180> off<00:05:50.330> to

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
the B and then you do to pull off to

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.280 
the B and then you do to pull off to
open<00:05:50.990> on<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.380> E<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.690> then<00:05:53.690> I<00:05:53.810> think<00:05:54.110> it's

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
open on the E and then I think it's

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.360 
open on the E and then I think it's
supposed<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.710> be<00:05:54.890> open<00:05:55.700> on<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.090> B<00:05:56.240> again<00:05:56.570> and

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
supposed to be open on the B again and

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.240 
supposed to be open on the B again and
then<00:05:58.370> three<00:05:58.670> open<00:05:59.150> pull<00:05:59.630> off<00:05:59.780> open<00:06:00.440> E<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.950> then

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
then three open pull off open E and then

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.430 
then three open pull off open E and then
open<00:06:01.520> on<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.760> beat<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:03.080> then<00:06:03.170> you<00:06:03.260> keep

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
open on the beat and then you keep

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.460 
open on the beat and then you keep
repeating<00:06:03.680> that

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.730 

but<00:06:10.400> I<00:06:10.790> don't<00:06:11.480> like<00:06:11.660> the<00:06:11.870> sound<00:06:12.170> when<00:06:12.530> it's<00:06:12.650> in

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
but I don't like the sound when it's in

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.700 
but I don't like the sound when it's in
distortion<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.430> it<00:06:14.300> hitting<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:14.870> open<00:06:15.200> B<00:06:15.380> all

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
distortion of it hitting the open B all

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.850 
distortion of it hitting the open B all
the<00:06:15.740> time<00:06:16.040> so<00:06:16.670> I<00:06:16.700> just<00:06:16.970> hit<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.900> pause<00:06:18.260> open<00:06:18.710> e

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
the time so I just hit to pause open e

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.220 
the time so I just hit to pause open e
and<00:06:19.130> then<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.280> hit<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:19.640> open<00:06:19.820> e<00:06:20.150> again<00:06:20.480> so<00:06:20.990> I<00:06:21.020> go

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
and then I hit the open e again so I go

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:28.469 
and then I hit the open e again so I go
like<00:06:21.350> this

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.179
