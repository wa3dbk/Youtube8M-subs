00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it for that I want to get too much into

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
it for that I want to get too much into
it<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.080> everyone<00:01:19.500> already<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.580> know

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it because everyone already has you know

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
it because everyone already has you know
said<00:01:21.840> their<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> most<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
said their thing about it and most of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
said their thing about it and most of
it's<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.840> repeated<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.380> me<00:01:25.710> anyway

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's going to be repeated by me anyway

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
it's going to be repeated by me anyway
so<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.369> already<00:01:26.610> wasted<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> minute

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so I already wasted probably a minute

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
so I already wasted probably a minute
talking<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.700> move<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.060> to
