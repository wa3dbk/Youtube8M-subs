hey the tunes pretty good where's my
cold<00:02:16.790> start<00:02:19.060> guess<00:02:20.060> that's<00:02:20.270> all<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.510> needs<00:02:21.819> all

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
cold start guess that's all it needs all

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.030 
cold start guess that's all it needs all
right<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:23.330> she's<00:02:23.569> I'm<00:02:24.200> at<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> guess<00:02:24.650> she's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
right so she's I'm at a guess she's

drives I think things should be all
right

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:55.250 

she's<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> good<00:02:45.299> little<00:02:45.450> motor

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
of loaded from the engine or what but

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.470 
of loaded from the engine or what but
and<00:03:32.620> then<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.610> into<00:03:33.760> fifth<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.209> kind<00:03:34.420> of

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and then going into fifth is kind of

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
and then going into fifth is kind of
funky<00:03:36.360> I've<00:03:37.360> heard<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.750> people<00:03:37.829> hurting<00:03:38.829> their

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
funky I've heard of people hurting their

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.630 
funky I've heard of people hurting their
ZF<00:03:39.519> trannies<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:41.280> having<00:03:42.280> issues<00:03:42.579> like

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
ZF trannies and and having issues like

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.380 
ZF trannies and and having issues like
that<00:03:43.030> but<00:03:44.129> I'm<00:03:45.129> hoping<00:03:45.459> mine's<00:03:45.700> not<00:03:45.970> getting

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
that but I'm hoping mine's not getting

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.270 
that but I'm hoping mine's not getting
there<00:03:46.510> I'll<00:03:46.720> probably<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:48.040> shop

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
there I'll probably just go to the shop

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.670 
there I'll probably just go to the shop
and<00:03:48.310> flush<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.030> check<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> fluid<00:03:50.170> maybe<00:03:50.410> put

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and flush it check the fluid maybe put

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.949 
and flush it check the fluid maybe put
in<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.920> better<00:03:51.099> fluid<00:03:51.519> rather<00:03:52.480> than<00:03:52.690> regular

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
in a better fluid rather than regular

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.059 
in a better fluid rather than regular
ATF<00:03:53.620> maybe<00:03:54.160> some<00:03:54.430> red<00:03:54.610> line<00:03:54.790> or<00:03:54.940> something
