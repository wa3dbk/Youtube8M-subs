the mistake that the backline makes at

the mistake that the backline makes at

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the beginning of the scheme you can see

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.660 
the beginning of the scheme you can see
the<00:00:13.259> pool<00:00:13.440> comes<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.040> miss<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.429> by<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
probably can read that the worst-case

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.420 
probably can read that the worst-case

inspired a little bit but Robbie wasn't

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.650 
inspired a little bit but Robbie wasn't
a<00:01:36.460> good<00:01:36.610> start<00:01:36.910> for<00:01:37.060> them<00:01:37.180> out<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.450> locker

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
a good start for them out of the locker

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.389 
a good start for them out of the locker
room<00:01:37.810> no<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.290> wasn't<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> big

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
room no it wasn't and this was a big

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.670 
room no it wasn't and this was a big
moment<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.060> big<00:01:40.300> no<00:01:40.750> call<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.320> think<00:01:41.560> that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
moment and a big no call I think that's

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.230 
moment and a big no call I think that's
a<00:01:41.770> push<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.190> think<00:01:42.430> that's<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.640> shot<00:01:42.880> in<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.090> back

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
a push I think that's a shot in the back

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.820 
a push I think that's a shot in the back

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
cigar gets in behind that situation is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.360 
cigar gets in behind that situation is
almost<00:01:49.300> impossible<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.110> defend<00:01:50.380> but<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.770> just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
almost impossible to defend but I just

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.680 
almost impossible to defend but I just
think<00:01:51.550> two<00:01:51.760> players<00:01:52.000> are<00:01:52.150> slowing<00:01:52.420> down<00:01:52.570> here

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
think two players are slowing down here

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.450 
situation gets nudged in front of the
board<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.050> hard<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.530> stop<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.950> up<00:02:00.130> getting

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
board it's hard to stop this up getting

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.550 
board it's hard to stop this up getting
off<00:02:00.850> balance<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.660> think<00:02:01.720> that's<00:02:02.050> a<00:02:02.110> shove<00:02:02.350> shove

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
off balance I think that's a shove shove

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.610 
off balance I think that's a shove shove
in<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.070> bag<00:02:03.540> yeah<00:02:04.540> that's<00:02:05.080> why<00:02:05.260> you<00:02:05.320> see

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
in the bag yeah that's why you see

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.410 
in the bag yeah that's why you see
defenders<00:02:06.130> my<00:02:06.280> position<00:02:06.700> dive<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.180> fall<00:02:07.390> down

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
defenders my position dive and fall down

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.050 
defenders my position dive and fall down
because<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.140> makes<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.619> more<00:02:08.920> exaggerated<00:02:09.820> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
because it makes it more exaggerated and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.730 
because it makes it more exaggerated and
he<00:02:10.360> tried<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.720> keep<00:02:10.899> his<00:02:10.960> feet<00:02:11.260> he<00:02:11.350> tried<00:02:11.590> to

he tried to keep his feet he tried to

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.380 
he tried to keep his feet he tried to
stay<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.190> he<00:02:12.280> got<00:02:12.370> not<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.850> off<00:02:13.150> balance

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
stay up but he got not so off balance

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
stay up but he got not so off balance
that<00:02:13.900> he<00:02:14.350> was<00:02:14.470> pushed<00:02:14.710> out<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> play<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
that he was pushed out of the play and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.890 
that he was pushed out of the play and
