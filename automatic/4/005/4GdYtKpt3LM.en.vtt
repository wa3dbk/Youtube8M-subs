00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello very good to all guys and girls 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.900
 we are here again as you see in another 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 a boxing this time has touched a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 raiden figure of the metal gear solid 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 rising that surely you have not seen 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 because it 's from the company of blows from 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 the play arts but before lombok sing 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.439
 I wanted to tell you that I had to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.800
 delete the video of the murcia party already 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 that as you know yesterday a little flea 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.720
 of youtubers hunting and they are erasing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 many videos of gameplays psychosis by 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 there and I deleted the video of the great 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 part because a little boy came out in the background 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 playing a battery game on 4 and I 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 I claim the rights and surely the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 upload or before this video then do not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 I know yet since I have to edit that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 zone and put another cut of those that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.239
 I have such a thing out there, but come on, I'll have 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.769
 the video during this week when I 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.570
 edit and see that I do not skip the copyright 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.059
 the sub at the moment has not had any 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.980
 another problem more and nothing simply that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 we go now to a boxing that is what 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.830
 It concerns us as I said we have here the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.140
 raiden figure of rebounding the truth is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 that very detailed has a lot of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.470
 accessories and also as a gift 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.140
 special 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.460
 The company that has sold me is 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.740
 figure has given me a house where 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.520
 sugar gospel gospel thing 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.520
 pretty curious 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.430
 and how do you see it looking in the camera 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.480
 now quite detailed and a small 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.510
 detail that I have been given 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.100
 and well we go to what is the figure of 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.960
 I'm going to show you all the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.980
 details we go here for the part of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.540
 back as you see here we have not 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.730
 we can put in different positions 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.700
 they have many more articulations than 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.380
 that he had his version of beach arts and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.390
 many more accessories as you see here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 it even carries a box is the same 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.430
 who made the metal gear figure 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 peace walker beta day solid peace walker 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.920
 the snake that I taught about three 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.300
 months or so and they have also done the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 detail this box I think that 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.080
 will be the platinium not so that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.870
 has more accessories like today 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.840
 red eye aside from a mythical scene of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.420
 that of the racing video game has a 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.569
 watermelon carries several types of sword 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.280
 blade several hands 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.049
 and good thing about the eye was this what I 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.999
 he said that he has the normal eye and then 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.579
 the red eye of also from another scene 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:31.999
 that appeared in the video game and good 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.030
 kids, let's open it and let's see 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:37.099
 more more in detail all the accessories 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.290
 that carries and the joints of this 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.730
 figure 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.639
 good ok here we would have the figure 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.639
 let's proceed to open it vale 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.939
 here we would take the doll with all the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.890
 details that we had before we are going to 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.079
 remove the plastic but first of all 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.689
 I wanted to teach except that as you see 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.750
 It is the cut out of the cardboard box 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.420
 where we can put the doll simulating 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.069
 in the typical let's say characteristics of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.220
 infiltration that have all the metal 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.170
 Diaz is already in solitas is to pívots 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 Metal and peace walker already had 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.829
 this box with the logo of the 25th anniversary 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.959
 and this one leads as we see here puts 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.549
 platinium express which is the company that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.159
 made this video game the metal gear 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.590
 rising that is has a game was a 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.569
 box that came out or came out in the game I do not know 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.010
 if you will remember it and well they see it 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.569
 small detail since it is made of 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.220
 cardboard is not not plastic like the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.730
 rest of figure 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.260
 and now let's open what is the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.510
 figure I do not know if it takes some does not wear 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.989
 nothing is worth pawning 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.180
 and let's see first of all first thing 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.360
 is the figure carries several plastics for 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 here 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.150
 here we see the face of the doll that very 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.900
 detailed and then take the goat as 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.660
 I say the eye can move or be for 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.030
 be able to limit different scenes of the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.790
 video game the armor is very good 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.329
 achieved takes many details and the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.910
 joints are hidden and we're going 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.830
 to see here the details that come 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.740
 in the blister that one of them that has 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.290
 made a lot of grace is the watermelon that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.690
 we see in the game when you cut them 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.410
 is how you see cut you can be 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.240
 can join vale can come and then 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.880
 we can even open and leads 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.410
 details here of the cut watermelon that 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.500
 the truth that a rather curious thing 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.480
 that part of the history of the game 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.480
 the watermelon are you that could leave since 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.640
 As you know, Raiden could practically 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.350
 cut it all in half and one of the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.150
 funny things that can be broken in 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.930
 the typical watermelons of these of the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.889
 samurai then we have here the extra eye 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.360
 that I was telling you that it's from a scene 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.820
 metal gear rising 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.960
 just when we are going to face the box 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.580
 in which this was done as parts 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.380
 there is a part where you say ride in 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.840
 that goes into a very strange state of 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.630
 madness and he gets his eye red and good 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.180
 we can put it here and if we can 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.650
 add to what is the final figure that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.900
 I was going to put it on so you can see it and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.080
 You see the mind system of moving the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.689
 eye 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.930
 we work around here then it also takes 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.250
 this is the viewer that takes in the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.100
 part of forward when it is 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.700
 fighting the character 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.740
 It also carries this that is not what it is 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.560
 well if a knife carries this dagger 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.210
 which is the one that uses gossip in the feet 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.670
 there I guess it will be for the sword 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.160
 and then what is the sword the katana 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.310
 the katana that the character uses here 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.200
 We carry the case and here the sword 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.200
 true pretty pretty pretty cool 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:05.580
 good nothing kids, I'm going to ride it 

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:08.429
 which is the figure I'm going to put the katana to 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.469
 all the accessories and I will show you 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:12.899
 already a shot with everything mounted I'm going to 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.319
 teach the mechanism of the eye of the 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:18.569
 figure and we analyze it here all together 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.399
 good kids we had already assembled the 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.949
 figure as you see I have changed the eye 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:25.379
 the system to change it is a 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.169
 little complex but it's basically catching 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:31.529
 this here that is kind of like 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.979
 face do not get your eye out with one with this 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.979
 mechanism 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.180
 and I usually change it for the blue you can 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.949
 put in the direction you want 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.479
 I'm going to put looking to the left to the 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.039
 right the truth that is very cool is 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.910
 a different system from the one I was wearing 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.560
 solid snake since this let's say it has not 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.199
 the typical stick to give you with the 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.210
 finger but it goes with this and then the 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.460
 doll would stay like you see very 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.990
 handsome with the red eye you have here the 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.630
 sword 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.400
 also carries in the pod the truth is 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.970
 that very very cool that also carries the 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.790
 dagger that can be put as you see thing 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.210
 pretty curious and kids this would be 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.980
 the final figure the figure mounted with 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.880
 all your joints in a posture 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.560
 pretty cool of the character and nothing 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.540
 I hope you liked this one 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.860
 boxing and continue editing tell me some 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.190
 question can you leave it in the 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.720
