to take it out of the bag you know the
flap<00:01:20.210> flips<00:01:21.020> over<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:22.039> set<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.399> up<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.210> you

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
flap flips over you can set it up so you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.510 
flap flips over you can set it up so you
can<00:01:23.360> watch<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.810> video<00:01:23.960> at<00:01:24.380> any<00:01:24.590> table<00:01:25.070> at<00:01:25.250> any

can watch a video at any table at any

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.370 
can watch a video at any table at any
couch<00:01:25.880> wherever<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.600> are<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.990> don't<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.259> to

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
couch wherever you are you don't have to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.870 
couch wherever you are you don't have to
hold<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:27.920> take<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.100> back<00:01:28.369> off<00:01:28.579> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
hold it you can take the back off and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
hold it you can take the back off and
you<00:01:28.969> never<00:01:29.180> have<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.479> remove<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.899> iPad<00:01:30.259> from

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
you never have to remove the iPad from

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.109 
you never have to remove the iPad from
the<00:01:30.530> back<00:01:30.680> itself<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.340> that's<00:01:31.460> pretty<00:01:31.759> cool

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
the back itself so that's pretty cool

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.319 
the back itself so that's pretty cool
and<00:01:32.479> then<00:01:33.380> finally<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.430> can<00:01:34.579> also<00:01:34.729> use<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.299> for

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
and then finally you can also use it for

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.499 
and then finally you can also use it for
presentations<00:01:36.200> as<00:01:36.350> well<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:38.329> works

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
presentations as well and that works

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.010 
presentations as well and that works
about<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.780> same<00:01:39.020> way<00:01:39.789> anyhow<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:41.119> also<00:01:41.659> said

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
about the same way anyhow I also said

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.149 
about the same way anyhow I also said
