00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.220 
like the second one just going to cut
another<00:00:19.720> man<00:00:20.350> hope<00:00:20.620> look

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.320 

so<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:25.130> fiscally<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.640> main<00:00:25.789> hope<00:00:26.060> the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
so this fiscally the main hope the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.939 
so this fiscally the main hope the
reason<00:00:26.539> I'm<00:00:26.630> calling<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:26.960> because<00:00:27.020> you<00:00:27.500> can't

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
reason I'm calling is because you can't

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.140 
reason I'm calling is because you can't
actually<00:00:28.160> do<00:00:28.369> anything<00:00:28.400> although<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.970> new

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
actually do anything although the new

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.240 
actually do anything although the new
game<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.539> Lord<00:00:29.720> came<00:00:29.900> on<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.140> main<00:00:30.289> menu<00:00:30.439> but

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
game and Lord came on the main menu but

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.150 
game and Lord came on the main menu but
it<00:00:31.820> is<00:00:32.300> your<00:00:32.480> usual<00:00:32.660> 3d<00:00:33.200> platformer<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.010> you've

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
it is your usual 3d platformer so you've

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.439 
it is your usual 3d platformer so you've
got<00:00:34.190> go<00:00:34.460> around<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.910> collect<00:00:34.970> the

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
got go around and collect the

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.270 
got go around and collect the
collectibles<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:36.470> it's<00:00:36.650> remotes<00:00:36.980> just

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280

one<00:05:45.100> I<00:05:45.310> mean<00:05:45.580> like<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.820> main<00:05:46.360> boss<00:05:46.660> is<00:05:46.840> pretty

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
one I mean like the main boss is pretty

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.960 
one I mean like the main boss is pretty
much<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.520> closest<00:05:48.520> thing<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.730> can<00:05:48.790> really

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
much the closest thing you can really

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.490 
much the closest thing you can really
class<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:49.420> proper<00:05:49.690> boss<00:05:49.960> fight<00:05:50.170> as<00:05:50.380> well

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
class to a proper boss fight as well

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.850 
class to a proper boss fight as well
which<00:05:51.190> is<00:05:51.340> a<00:05:51.370> bit<00:05:51.730> Michelle<00:05:52.060> but<00:05:52.810> there's<00:05:53.740> now

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
which is a bit Michelle but there's now

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.100 
which is a bit Michelle but there's now
not<00:05:54.160> really<00:05:54.430> much<00:05:54.550> new<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.150> game<00:05:55.330> or<00:05:55.690> new<00:05:56.080> to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
one obviously this is the only one of

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.760 
one obviously this is the only one of
the<00:06:01.300> three<00:06:01.360> that's<00:06:01.750> currently<00:06:02.020> on<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.320> PSN

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
the PSN on North America and hopefully

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.400 
the PSN on North America and hopefully
it'll<00:06:06.460> come<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.880> observe<00:06:07.240> dogs<00:06:07.480> so<00:06:08.020> it's

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
it'll come to you observe dogs so it's

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.500 
it'll come to you observe dogs so it's
one<00:06:08.530> of<00:06:08.650> those<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:09.070> I'm<00:06:09.790> just<00:06:10.150> seeing<00:06:10.390> this

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
one of those that I'm just seeing this

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.120 
one of those that I'm just seeing this
simply<00:06:10.810> because<00:06:11.080> if<00:06:11.350> that's<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.800> only<00:06:11.830> way

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
simply because if that's the only way

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.190 
simply because if that's the only way
you<00:06:12.190> can<00:06:12.400> get<00:06:12.580> your<00:06:12.790> games<00:06:13.210> then<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.930> don't

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
you can get your games then you don't
