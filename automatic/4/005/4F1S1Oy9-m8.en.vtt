going<00:01:11.310> through<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.000> old<00:01:12.330> test<00:01:13.170> strips

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.609 
on one and the design that she liked on
another<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:20.299> that's<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.630> ended<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.409> using

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
another and that's how we ended up using
