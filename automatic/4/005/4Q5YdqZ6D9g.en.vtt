00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.190 
being a bit like when you were kid in
the<00:01:43.729> garage<00:01:44.030> way<00:01:44.270> you're<00:01:44.720> betting<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.079> your

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the garage way you're betting on your

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.779 
the garage way you're betting on your
own<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.590> until<00:01:46.069> they<00:01:46.159> get<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.429> out<00:01:46.610> you're

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
own and until they get you out you're

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.459 
own and until they get you out you're
still<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.509> that's<00:01:47.990> really<00:01:48.380> good<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:50.469> think

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
still in and that's really good I think

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.719

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
this has a wide appeal because if you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.160
