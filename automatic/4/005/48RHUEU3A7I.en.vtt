00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
but this right here is the 45 colt I

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.090

this stick it into that and you're good

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.870 
this stick it into that and you're good
for<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.740> very<00:02:22.250> very<00:02:22.520> short<00:02:22.880> range<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.880> that's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
for just very very short range so that's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.670 
for just very very short range so that's
right<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.180> before<00:02:26.630> clinking<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.440> stuff

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
right here before clinking and stuff

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.530 
right here before clinking and stuff
like<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:29.020> suppose<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.170> could<00:02:30.500> use<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:31.070> for

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
like that I suppose you could use it for

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.570 
like that I suppose you could use it for
very<00:02:32.540> close<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:35.200> varmint<00:02:36.200> hunting<00:02:36.580> not

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
very close in varmint hunting not

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.180 
very close in varmint hunting not
recommended<00:02:38.180> though<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:39.230> know<00:02:39.350> last<00:02:39.620> resort

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
recommended though you know last resort

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.479 
recommended though you know last resort
but<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:41.390> recommended<00:02:41.800> now<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:43.280> notice

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
but not recommended now you will notice

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.270 
but not recommended now you will notice
that<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.840> said<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> rimfire<00:02:45.800> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that like I said this is a rimfire and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.479 
that like I said this is a rimfire and
it's<00:02:46.970> offset<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.750> order<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.739> getting<00:02:49.010> any<00:02:49.220> sort

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
it's offset in order to getting any sort

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.300 
it's offset in order to getting any sort
of<00:02:49.610> accuracy<00:02:50.150> out<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.420> these<00:02:50.510> at<00:02:50.720> all<00:02:51.160> what<00:02:52.160> you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
of accuracy out of these at all what you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.720 
of accuracy out of these at all what you
need<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.670> do<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:54.170> make<00:02:54.650> sure<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:55.459> when<00:02:55.610> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
need to do is make sure that when you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.130 
need to do is make sure that when you
load<00:02:56.390> your<00:02:56.660> revolver<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:59.000> case<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.989> load

load your revolver in this case to load

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.050 
load your revolver in this case to load
one<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.380> these<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.550> take<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> chamber

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
one of these you just take the chamber

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.729 
one of these you just take the chamber
insert<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.930> insert<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.530> like<00:03:03.650> you

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
insert and you insert it just like you

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
in the same orientation if you just load

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.059 
in the same orientation if you just load
them<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.849> there<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.319> one<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.469> the<00:03:32.530> facing<00:03:32.950> at

nine o'clock you're not going to get any

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.149 
nine o'clock you're not going to get any
kind<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.629> accuracy<00:03:38.079> out<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.379> this<00:03:38.530> at<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.859> and

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
kind of accuracy out of this at all and

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.699 
kind of accuracy out of this at all and
like<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.879> said<00:03:40.000> accuracy<00:03:40.689> is<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:41.349> poor<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
like I said accuracy is really poor to

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.619 
like I said accuracy is really poor to
begin<00:03:41.980> with<00:03:42.159> it's<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.819> very<00:03:43.180> very<00:03:43.450> very

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
begin with it's just a very very very

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.699 
begin with it's just a very very very
close<00:03:43.930> range<00:03:44.500> weapon<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.489> allows<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.090> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
close range weapon this allows you to

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.580 
close range weapon this allows you to
shoot<00:03:47.709> your<00:03:47.950> your<00:03:48.400> sidearm<00:03:49.379> get<00:03:50.379> more

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
shoot your your sidearm get more

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.229 
shoot your your sidearm get more
practice<00:03:51.099> out<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.760> it

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
practice out of it

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.970 
practice out of it
Coltrane<00:03:52.870> practice<00:03:53.469> but<00:03:53.620> you're

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
Coltrane practice but you're

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.319 
Coltrane practice but you're
concentrating<00:03:54.280> more<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.730> trigger<00:03:55.120> pull<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
concentrating more on trigger pull and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.470 
concentrating more on trigger pull and
things<00:03:55.629> like<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.989> then<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:57.849> normally<00:03:58.239> can

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
things like that then you normally can

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.539 
things like that then you normally can
with<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.349> full<00:03:59.530> power<00:03:59.560> around<00:04:00.129> which<00:04:00.310> these

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
with the full power around which these

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.420 
with the full power around which these
are<00:04:00.730> getting<00:04:00.939> really<00:04:01.120> expensive<00:04:01.569> these<00:04:01.840> days

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
are getting really expensive these days

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.490 
are getting really expensive these days
if<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:04.090> really<00:04:04.419> have<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.870> practice<00:04:05.019> full

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
if you really have to practice full

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.069 
if you really have to practice full
power<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.720> get<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.870> lot<00:04:08.049> more

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
power but you can get a lot more

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.089 
power but you can get a lot more
practice<00:04:08.680> in<00:04:08.889> if<00:04:09.280> you're<00:04:09.519> using<00:04:09.780> 22s<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.099> when

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
these are not necessarily for just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.070 
these are not necessarily for just
revolvers<00:04:26.740> anything<00:04:27.610> that's<00:04:27.760> 45<00:04:28.510> long<00:04:28.690> colt

revolvers anything that's 45 long colt

revolvers anything that's 45 long colt
or<00:04:29.260> 45<00:04:29.680> colt

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
any kind of weapon these will pretty

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.899 
any kind of weapon these will pretty
much<00:04:32.889> work<00:04:33.070> in<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.919> only<00:04:36.159> drawback<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.789> the

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
much work in the only drawback to the

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:44.370 
much work in the only drawback to the
system<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:40.710> taking<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.479> spent<00:04:43.810> cartridge<00:04:43.990> out

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
system is taking the spent cartridge out

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.129 
system is taking the spent cartridge out
and<00:04:45.070> then<00:04:45.159> normally<00:04:45.550> you've<00:04:46.060> got<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.960> little

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
and then normally you've got this little

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.060 
and then normally you've got this little
button<00:04:47.500> right<00:04:47.740> here<00:04:47.770> or<00:04:48.099> a<00:04:48.310> little<00:04:48.909> slide<00:04:50.070> well

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
button right here or a little slide well

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.779 
button right here or a little slide well
if<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.280> pull<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.240> back<00:04:52.539> it<00:04:53.320> will<00:04:53.500> hit<00:04:53.949> the

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
if you pull that back it will hit the

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.969 
if you pull that back it will hit the
chamber<00:04:55.180> insert<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.659> push<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.900> out<00:04:55.990> sometimes

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
chamber insert and push it out sometimes

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.350 
chamber insert and push it out sometimes
it<00:04:57.159> just<00:04:57.280> goes<00:04:57.400> right<00:04:57.639> on<00:04:57.789> down<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.090> center

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
it just goes right on down the center

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.480 
it just goes right on down the center
most<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.139> time<00:04:59.320> actually<00:04:59.530> it<00:05:00.190> goes<00:05:00.310> right

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
most of the time actually it goes right

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.649 
most of the time actually it goes right
on<00:05:00.550> down<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.880> center<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.150> doesn't<00:05:01.330> hit<00:05:01.419> that

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
on down the center it doesn't hit that

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.810 
on down the center it doesn't hit that
well<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.289> problem<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.400> has<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.699> hit

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
well the problem is it has to hit

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.370 
well the problem is it has to hit
something<00:05:04.300> there<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.720> either<00:05:04.810> have<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.229> hit

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
something there so it either have to hit

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.520 
something there so it either have to hit
for<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:05.590> 22<00:05:06.070> spent<00:05:07.030> noun<00:05:07.240> or<00:05:07.509> it<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.229> to<00:05:08.380> hit

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
for the 22 spent noun or it have to hit

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.149 
for the 22 spent noun or it have to hit
the<00:05:09.099> insert<00:05:09.520> if<00:05:10.389> you<00:05:10.690> hit<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.139> 20<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.710> fit<00:05:11.919> run

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
the insert if you hit the 20 to fit run

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.680 
the insert if you hit the 20 to fit run
its<00:05:12.340> gonna<00:05:12.460> kick<00:05:12.699> up<00:05:12.849> and<00:05:13.000> step<00:05:13.180> round<00:05:13.419> and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
its gonna kick up and step round and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.570 
its gonna kick up and step round and
then<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:13.900> can<00:05:14.199> insert<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.979> 22<00:05:15.370> long-rifle

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
then you can insert the 22 long-rifle

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.589 
then you can insert the 22 long-rifle
again<00:05:16.380> or<00:05:17.639> it's<00:05:18.639> going<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:18.970> just<00:05:19.240> push<00:05:19.479> the

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
again or it's going to just push the

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.570 
again or it's going to just push the
whole<00:05:19.720> chamber<00:05:19.930> insert<00:05:20.320> start<00:05:20.740> insert<00:05:21.370> out

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
whole chamber insert start insert out

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.749 
whole chamber insert start insert out
and<00:05:22.000> then<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:23.080> get<00:05:23.199> the<00:05:23.349> 22<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.919> spent<00:05:24.159> 22<00:05:24.580> out

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
and then to get the 22 to spent 22 out

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.610 
and then to get the 22 to spent 22 out
just<00:05:25.240> all<00:05:25.570> on<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.840> other<00:05:25.930> end<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.320> will<00:05:26.409> come

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
just all on the other end it will come

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.670 
just all on the other end it will come
right<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:27.449> so<00:05:28.449> it<00:05:28.570> can<00:05:28.780> be<00:05:28.990> difficult<00:05:29.289> to

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
right out so it can be difficult to

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.980 
right out so it can be difficult to
extract<00:05:30.430> them<00:05:30.750> it's<00:05:31.750> not<00:05:31.960> really<00:05:32.830> quick

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
extract them it's not really quick

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.350 
extract them it's not really quick
anything<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.890> really<00:05:35.190> slow<00:05:35.490> with<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.030> single

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
anything is really slow with a single

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.130 
anything is really slow with a single
action<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:37.520> when<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.640> comes<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.060> taking<00:05:40.020> these

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
action but when it comes to taking these

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.990 
action but when it comes to taking these
little<00:05:40.620> buggers<00:05:40.770> out<00:05:41.010> it's<00:05:41.700> a<00:05:41.730> lot<00:05:41.880> more

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
little buggers out it's a lot more

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.160 
little buggers out it's a lot more
challenging<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:42.660> do<00:05:43.470> recommend<00:05:44.930> these<00:05:45.930> little

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
challenging I do recommend these little

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.680 
challenging I do recommend these little
