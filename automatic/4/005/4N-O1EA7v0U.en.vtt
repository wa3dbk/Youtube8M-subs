like right come down here now the
typical<00:02:19.280> minecraft<00:02:20.280> lighting<00:02:20.640> algorithm

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
typical minecraft lighting algorithm

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.340 
typical minecraft lighting algorithm
makes<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.290> every<00:02:23.280> block<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.690> has

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
makes it so that every block as the has

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.750 
makes it so that every block as the has
equal<00:02:25.830> lighting<00:02:26.130> throughout<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.459> entire

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
equal lighting throughout the entire

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.670 
equal lighting throughout the entire
block<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.870> degrades<00:02:28.320> block<00:02:28.680> by<00:02:28.890> block<00:02:30.680> what

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
block so degrades block by block what

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.949 
block so degrades block by block what
the<00:02:31.800> spod<00:02:32.070> does<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.420> simulates<00:02:33.720> real

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the spod does is it simulates real

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.640 
the spod does is it simulates real
lighting<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:36.360> goes<00:02:36.630> space<00:02:37.170> by<00:02:37.380> space

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
lighting and that it goes space by space

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.340 
lighting and that it goes space by space
so<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> has<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.070> circular<00:02:38.760> effect<00:02:39.209> which<00:02:40.110> really

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
so it has a circular effect which really

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.620 
so it has a circular effect which really
