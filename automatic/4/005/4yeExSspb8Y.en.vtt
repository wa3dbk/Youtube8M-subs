00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.810
 and that now they go of rivers we are in a 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.089
 new video and this time we're in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.099
 5 large photos online and for nothing 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.919
 I'm endo wanted this time I bring you a 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.570
 super gray of infinite money and without 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.820
 help and all this is pretty 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.530
 project very very very cool ok and so 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.420
 well let's start the first thing that 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.910
 we have to do is going to be changing the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.190
 value to a motorcycle ok I'm going to 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.600
 say the materials are the elements 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.340
 that are needed to be able to do this 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.290
 gray that works perfectly because 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.850
 I did several times ok as well I 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.920
 I have here the catch if bhatti and this 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.630
 car that is the trevor and the leader that 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970
 is the one I'm going to use to change him 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.380
 the value to the motorcycle ok once 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.910
 saying that we're just going to grab 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.800
 our car this is the one of trevor 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.330
 they can buy on the tab 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.100
 the ugliest cars where the car is in 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.320
 revel and everything is where here once 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.989
 saying this we have to get this 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.550
 truck or car whatever and we're going to 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.420
 having to press the brake to be 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.280
 mark those 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.020
 tires there that is marked and in the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 floor and we will accommodate the truck 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.460
 just in those lines that are over 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 to mark ok once done this we have 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.869
 to grab our bike to be able 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 change the milestone value of this band ok 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.710
 here I'm going to pass a strange ship that does not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 I have no idea why but 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.039
 the gray works or works to the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.530
 perfection and it's going to happen that we go out 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.390
 flying and I do not know how much thing that is 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.130
 well there's how you can see that happened 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.689
 to put on and all that and how can 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.289
 see the map I have this motorcycle that is there 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.030
 down below me and the motorcycle that is there in the 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.380
 sidewalk and everything is giving here after 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.300
 we're going to have to grab a vehicle and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.069
 move the truck to get the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.420
 motorcycle that is under the car once 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.549
 we have done this and as you can see 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 There is the bike that is mine and the bike that 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.970
 cloned and all this wave and once 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 let's have the motorcycle and all this not 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.869
 we are simply going to move away from our 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 house and we're going to mark the mechanic 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.280
 ok we go away a distance then something 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.810
 considerable every state in which I 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 I want I'm checking I'm going to ask for the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 the car more expensive than you 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.500
 have to ask for it to be able to change me 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.700
 the value to the motorcycle would be to ask and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.319
 I'm waiting for it to arrive 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.590
 well, let's wait for your stand and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.209
 rim I think it will arrive if I do not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.220
 I'm wrong that it arrived as you can see 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.560
 there is the standard rite and now 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.200
 would be almost finished to change the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.310
 value these are these to change the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.080
 value to what has been the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.760
 motorcycle then let's go on 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.470
 our house and everything is where we were going to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.780
 put us as if nothing had happened 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.400
 ok just here I put it on camera 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.950
 medium fast and everything is where to go and I 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.569
 I put in and let's go now let's see that the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.489
 motorcycle is already in another place in 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.980
 where was the leader so already the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.560
 motorcycle would be worth 600 thousand 700 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.630
 thousand later we will do the same 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.150
 procedure we are going to put the truck 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.010
 is outside we press the fresnito of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.349
 this sling to mark the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.450
 tires in the in the little apartment is andy and the 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.209
 let's go back to accommodate this yes 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.920
 dress that creates and just just right a 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.360
 little transit not ending where 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.950
 the lines start ok 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.239
 well here as you can see I'm 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.130
 doing that procedure again and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.739
 all this in derry and now I'm going to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.420
 accommodate the truck is ok once from 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.790
 that we have accommodated it, let's go 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.440
 be our granite stand and ree and go 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.730
 to grab what would be coming now the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.409
 motorcycle 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.909
 for the step of this to change the value 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.739
 we would not have to do the bike anymore 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.659
 or nothing else is done once for 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.580
 Then I can do it several times and 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.870
 follow all this wave and it can be done 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.239
 followed because I have done several 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.890
 times ok once this is done simply 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.739
 let's get into the bike that is worth 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.120
 now 700 thousand or 600 thousand ok me and the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.830
 I grabbed and I'm leaving the garage and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 all this was going to happen the same one 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.360
 it's going to be the same bus that happened to us 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.739
 be able to change the value ok there 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.230
 As you can see, try to leave but not 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.569
 can but let's hope it comes out 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.299
 flying and that 's how you can see in the 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.950
 map and put on the bike that is my friend 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.750
 and the bike that is down here that is 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.910
 cloned after we have to be the same 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 process of moving the car this with another 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.420
 car to be able to grab the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.690
 motorcycle ok this is in fast camera 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.760
 and everything is where I will go so that I do not spend 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.290
 a long time this ok once I already 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 let's have the motorcycle which is what we have 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.129
 what to do, we have to take it to the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.200
 saints custom and we're going to be able to 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.000
 sell and all this band ok and like 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.470
 can see I'm in the custom saints and 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.150
 well, let's put our first 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.590
 tire we are going to take out the cell phone we are going to 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.539
 go to the internet tab 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.919
 subsequently to travel and transportation and 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.730
 after these cars that are the most 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.380
 ugly ok 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.970
 once we are here we are going to have to 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.500
 buy the street in revel that is that 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.850
 it costs three thousand dollars no matter the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.250
 color and all this is not simply the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.650
 purchase but we bought it now because 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.210
 we keep it in the garage that we want and 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.160
 Well, let's go back to take out the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.430
 cellular and let's call the mechanic 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.230
 and let's put it where it says backwards and 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.230
 then we go to get it down cellular 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.890
 I'm already putting the revel and low 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.720
 the cell phone inside is enough custom 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.640
 once we are here we have to press 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.990
 A to select the rebel and 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.270
 offspring of our side controls 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.910
 right that and this is fast very fast 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.860
 then we will give where it says sell and 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.270
 then here as you can see they give me 600 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.490
 and so many thousand dollars that is what 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.200
 they would come giving by the leader that 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.210
 I changed the value to the motorcycle of this wave 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.800
 ok and as you can see now we have to 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.570
 wait for him to load a little circle 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.330
 naranjita how are you going to see right now 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.400
 then a little orange circle and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.590
 all this wave once you have loaded the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.600
 circle we can sell the motorcycle 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.550
 without any problem and the cliché would be 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.020
 finished this now I'm going to direct 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.490
 to my garage so they can see that there 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.800
 Follow the truck at two 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.880
 motorcycles and we can do the gray of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.550
 new does not matter 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.140
 nothing happens the gray is infinite without 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.350
 help and he's giving us a quantity of 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.030
 money that is pretty but that is 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.620
 that amount of money and this whole band 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.330
 ok there are as you can see I'm going to get there 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.680
 towards my garage and everything is where I go to 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.140
 enter so they can see that it is still there 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.460
 the respective cars you use there 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.870
 As you can see, that motorcycle is 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.380
 white van and on the other side we have 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.570
 the motorbike worth 700 thousand or 600 thousand 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.100
 It depends on how the 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.440
 value ok and well, that would be 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.120
 everything and then they were going to go I hope they 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.160
 I liked it they are able to comment 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.750
 share with your super financiers 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.860
 super likes and then nothing in the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.720
 description I will leave my channel 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.610
 secondary and also my beautiful 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.650
 facebook so that secret open this wave 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.780
 and that would be everything as they can 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.390
 see this cliché is quite pro and very 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.220
 easy without help and that's all we'll see 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:22.130
 until a next gameplay as always 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.130
 a greeting and bye bye
