second of all I recommend that backing

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.339 
second of all I recommend that backing
up<00:02:29.159> all<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.120> save<00:02:30.330> files<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.200> bin

anything up but on rare occasions it has

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.339 
anything up but on rare occasions it has
I<00:02:37.530> guess<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.310> certain<00:02:38.730> computers<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.989> certain

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
I guess for certain computers or certain

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.140 
I guess for certain computers or certain
mods<00:02:41.340> clashing<00:02:42.150> or<00:02:42.360> something<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.470> caused

safe files to wipe or something this

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.610 
safe files to wipe or something this
isn't<00:02:47.040> common<00:02:47.489> at<00:02:47.670> all<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.269> worry<00:02:48.620> but

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
isn't common at all so don't worry but

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
isn't common at all so don't worry but
backing<00:02:50.069> up<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.340> save<00:02:50.640> files<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.810> always<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
backing up your save files is always a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.160 
backing up your save files is always a
good<00:02:52.500> idea<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.140> any

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
good idea so do that and if you have any

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.449 
good idea so do that and if you have any
mods<00:02:55.500> or<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.799> think<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.099> good<00:02:56.160> idea<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
mods or do you think it's a good idea to

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.190 
mods or do you think it's a good idea to

backup your bin folder that way you

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.270 
backup your bin folder that way you

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
to delete it you're just installing a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.039 
to delete it you're just installing a
texture<00:04:04.260> pack<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.889> do<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.459> anyway<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:06.049> to

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
texture pack but I do it anyway just to

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.430 
texture pack but I do it anyway just to
get<00:04:07.169> rid<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.470> pesky<00:04:07.799> bugger<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:09.349> did<00:04:10.349> this

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
get rid of the pesky bugger I did this

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.089 
get rid of the pesky bugger I did this
with<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> fresh<00:04:11.180> file<00:04:12.180> as<00:04:12.359> well<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.859> it<00:04:13.859> should

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
with a fresh file as well and it should

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.250 
with a fresh file as well and it should
work<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.459> fine<00:04:14.760> now<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.810> let's<00:04:15.959> go<00:04:16.079> ahead<00:04:16.109> and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
work just fine now so let's go ahead and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.670 
work just fine now so let's go ahead and
load<00:04:16.410> up<00:04:16.470> minecraft<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.220> see<00:04:17.310> how<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.459> works

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
load up minecraft and see how it works

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.140 
load up minecraft and see how it works
ok<00:04:19.680> we're<00:04:19.859> back<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.549> can<00:04:20.699> see<00:04:20.729> all<00:04:20.910> the

ok we're back and as you can see all the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.850 
ok we're back and as you can see all the
textures<00:04:21.720> working<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.260> looks<00:04:22.440> almost<00:04:22.620> exactly

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860

have problems you can always go back to
using<00:05:16.379> the<00:05:16.680> HD<00:05:17.189> fixer<00:05:17.659> method<00:05:18.659> if<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:18.990> know

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
using the HD fixer method if you know

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.140 
using the HD fixer method if you know
how<00:05:19.529> to<00:05:19.560> use<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.219> not<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.849> my<00:05:21.029> old

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
how to use that if not I have my old

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.170 
how to use that if not I have my old
videos<00:05:21.330> still<00:05:21.930> up<00:05:22.189> it<00:05:23.189> should<00:05:23.520> still<00:05:23.759> work<00:05:23.819> as

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
videos still up it should still work as

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.779 
videos still up it should still work as
well<00:05:24.650> but<00:05:25.650> like<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.949> said<00:05:26.009> I<00:05:26.189> haven't<00:05:26.370> had<00:05:26.610> any

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
well but like I said I haven't had any

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.519 
well but like I said I haven't had any
problems<00:05:26.879> with<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.389> so<00:05:27.750> far<00:05:27.990> at<00:05:28.110> all<00:05:28.199> and

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
problems with this so far at all and

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.170 
problems with this so far at all and
it's<00:05:28.650> pretty<00:05:28.979> simple<00:05:29.250> installation<00:05:29.610> at<00:05:30.029> least

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
it's pretty simple installation at least

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.170 
it's pretty simple installation at least
easier<00:05:30.719> than<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.379> HD<00:05:31.740> fixer<00:05:32.129> and<00:05:32.370> has<00:05:32.939> a<00:05:32.969> lot

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
easier than the HD fixer and has a lot

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.640 
easier than the HD fixer and has a lot
less<00:05:33.360> problems<00:05:34.610> but<00:05:35.610> um<00:05:36.469> speaking<00:05:37.469> of

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
less problems but um speaking of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.499 
less problems but um speaking of
problems<00:05:37.830> though<00:05:38.219> if<00:05:38.699> you<00:05:38.879> do<00:05:39.180> have<00:05:39.479> any

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
problems though if you do have any

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
say something screwed everything up

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.959 
say something screwed everything up
because<00:06:31.469> if<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:31.830> does<00:06:32.039> screw<00:06:32.310> up<00:06:32.490> then<00:06:32.759> you<00:06:32.849> can

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
because if it does screw up then you can

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.459
