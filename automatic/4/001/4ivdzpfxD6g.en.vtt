00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to my first top ten list where there is actually no 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.729
 Really note the players are just supposed to be a kind of one 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.729
 other point 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.469
 Co-started 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.949
 according to CNN was at that time very much the big innovation skate to small 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.279
 loss 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.430
 i think i did not have that except except just wanted to show how 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.229
 Walldorf already racing games can be represented in the early nineties 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.219
 There were times when the oldest Christian themes along with this 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.720
 Player wanted the host 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.260
 for comics and weighty finds the run so I had a lot on the set 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 motivation 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.740
 yes Adventure I have already 12 sentence was put there as well on this 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 one or the other title would have to see its own four times 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.090
 well with my so the eu-far not completely satisfied I have yes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.800
 already makes question then 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.740
 there are some games you should really play it once too 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
 if you were not convinced by one of them 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.030
 Euro, however, I did not have a plan at the time like they do not have this game 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.170
 at that time rioted totally unknown language 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 and then today I will also be unknown to her black 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.560
 but got 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.650
 it's just super job on 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.290
 Team leader at that time already relatively 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.610
 ours in Nursery lights satchel well in the 16 paid 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.090
 impressed me with this game is different this service on the train 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.410
 Parallax colleagues 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.410
 the palace 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 first work 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.310
 Darwin 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.399
 What is happening here anywhere else in the world may be actively what the team's first game 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.640
 Super FX Schick had installed directly on the floor 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.730
 the benefit was the century that represented Double the Number One more 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.679
 a few 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.890
 I think the successor is because they say something better this game makes you 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 not wrong if you are a bit excited 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.909
 Red 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.829
 Super Mario Kart here over the cross street had greeted Lucerne 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.729
 also for the routes, however, compared to the newer Malte I am 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.559
 look pretty flat 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.769
 he keeps the multiplayer battles very much fun today 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.269
 still 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.099
 since a Singspiel could do it you go left collect coins 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.429
 which affects the driving behavior of the new 6 the consistency 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.129
 very nice the idea was later discarded restrict the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.129
 Traffic accident service their 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.569
 she mediates 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.989
 The entry-level wage Zurich Access to the example of a franchise has never been this way 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.639
 all 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 but important, I think you should already be available 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.329
 then on the planet Cedes space for space goes through everything 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.969
 I have that a bit of the problem with the whole series 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.969
 I was always allowed to be philosophical 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.229
 You have to give the boys a long time, always had to search well maybe I did 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.139
 just not enough time 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.930
 Percent plus maybe well 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.660
 if sometime when the series returns to its roots after the World Cup 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.789
 returns 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.789
 restart again 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.459
 GH 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.499
 These players are pretty exotic although I think so too 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.340
 from an excited last years 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.840
 So again transferred to food which persons or by six percent 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.050
 back I know 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.900
 The game mechanics is certainly the big one from the area of ​​cops 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.379
 Honor killings whole game 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.199
 flying cows against worms fly crows in battle suits 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.400
 flying 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 Jena 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.860
 HR Formula to third place Klopp 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.279
 I do not know how I can have this game of the evening had as well 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.279
 by the way, have advertised pretty tricky 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.870
 Unfortunately this piece has changed like memory but they were different 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.440
 deducted in the first half of the year 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.580
 so you celeb major effort Latif Roth 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.050
 the last big step step by step could disturb there 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.069
 two percentage points 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.800
 even if the whole game is one 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.909
 The only cup in Wales has each section pulled off its own little 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.499
 gameplay-elements 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:25.449
 the whole is then right 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.039
 had varied 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 Where 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.639
 b 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.539
 a super game what's up to cancel the game 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.539
 unbelievable for that time 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.449
 Also today a home game Dr 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.449
 tricky e10 beautiful world 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.139
 Super boss 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.209
 in the place itself into the gold card of the upper world 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.469
 Years under the 1 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.169
 and that's exactly her two games I wanted to deal with that 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.860
 is actually only one game per franchise run of space creates 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.509
 otherwise additional external 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.120
 play the label two 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.960
 Marienwörth times over two of the shift 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.680
 a great ambiance 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.950
 It's hard to say which one is better, so it's quite different 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.959
 I think you can but make it look that are just super 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.960
 they just have fun they still had with a long messy story 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.960
 rather 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.529
 but simply offer the player the water the most and longest known 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.529
 the fun 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.069
 the wars
