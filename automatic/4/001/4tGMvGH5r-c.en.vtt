alright<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.860> think<00:00:01.920> we're<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.580> it's<00:00:02.939> propped

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
alright I think we're going it's propped

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.140 
alright I think we're going it's propped
up<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.110> rag<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.890> we're<00:00:05.279> mostly<00:00:05.640> visible<00:00:06.740> so

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
up on my rag and we're mostly visible so

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.240 
up on my rag and we're mostly visible so
we've<00:00:09.150> made<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.480> pretty<00:00:09.780> safe<00:00:10.080> again<00:00:11.070> I'm

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
we've made it this pretty safe again I'm

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.530 
we've made it this pretty safe again I'm
not<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> camera<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> try

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
not in the camera but I'm going to try

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.289 
not in the camera but I'm going to try
to<00:00:12.599> talk<00:00:12.780> loud<00:00:13.049> enough<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.089> grab

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
to talk loud enough so that we can grab

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.410 
to talk loud enough so that we can grab
this<00:00:21.050> you<00:00:22.050> tight<00:00:22.320> fit<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.250> angle<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this you tight fit and angle it in a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.650 
this you tight fit and angle it in a
little<00:00:24.779> bit<00:00:29.810> right<00:00:30.810> there<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.199> let<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.529> grip

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
little bit right there we let our grip

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:45.610 
little bit right there we let our grip
go<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> way<00:00:34.079> where<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> tightest

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.530 

now<00:00:48.200> tell<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> sound<00:00:49.530> difference<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.309> we

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
now tell the sound difference when we

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.700 
now tell the sound difference when we
start<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.660> put<00:00:51.809> power<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.320> everything

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
start to put power this everything

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.880 
start to put power this everything
tightens<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> been<00:00:58.170> nice<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
tightens up it's been nice to you at

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.470 
tightens up it's been nice to you at
this<00:00:59.010> point<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.640> again<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.150> spin<00:01:00.360> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this point you can again you can spin it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
this point you can again you can spin it
around<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.050> okay<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:02.220> bolts<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.730> look

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
around and go okay my bolts all look

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
around and go okay my bolts all look
pretty<00:01:03.030> straight<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> bolt<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.070> through

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
pretty straight the bolt going through

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.680 
pretty straight the bolt going through
the<00:01:05.550> center<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> nice<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.509> parallel

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
the center is nice and parallel

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.219 
the center is nice and parallel
nothing's<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.130> side<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:10.050> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
nothing's going off to one side and you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
nothing's going off to one side and you
can<00:01:10.380> continue<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:11.610> make<00:01:11.790> sure<00:01:11.820> our<00:01:11.970> guns

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
can continue let's make sure our guns

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.810 
can continue let's make sure our guns
all<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.110> yep

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
all the way up yep

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.320 
all the way up yep
and<00:01:14.820> push<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.119> quite<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> bit<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.690> torque<00:01:16.110> here

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.670 

so<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.750> case<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> didn't<00:01:22.410> go<00:01:22.500> off

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so now in this case it didn't go off

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
so now in this case it didn't go off
like<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> gun<00:01:28.190> instead<00:01:29.720> just<00:01:30.720> slipped<00:01:31.050> off

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
like a gun instead just slipped off

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.139 
like a gun instead just slipped off
nicely<00:01:31.590> until<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.280> backed<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.700> into<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
nicely until it backed up into the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.980 
nicely until it backed up into the
washer<00:01:34.399> from<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:37.610> flywheel<00:01:38.610> bolts<00:01:39.330> lock<00:01:39.660> tab

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
use the diaphragm spring style and you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
use the diaphragm spring style and you
can<00:01:52.259> readily<00:01:52.710> tell<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.250> apart<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> glance

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
can readily tell those apart at a glance

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.020 
can readily tell those apart at a glance
once<00:01:54.960> you've<00:01:55.140> seen<00:01:55.350> them

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.030 

it's<00:01:58.510> almost<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.020> same<00:01:59.050> process<00:01:59.680> except

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
it's almost the same process except

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's almost the same process except
you'll<00:02:00.190> use<00:02:00.400> standard<00:02:00.940> bolts<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.380> other

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
you'll use standard bolts to the other

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.550 
you'll use standard bolts to the other
flywheel<00:02:03.010> where<00:02:03.220> 3/8<00:02:03.640> 24<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.110> now<00:02:05.230> then<00:02:05.470> you

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
flywheel where 3/8 24 so now then you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.950 
flywheel where 3/8 24 so now then you
look<00:02:05.740> back<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:08.020> our<00:02:08.050> 30<00:02:08.470> millimeter<00:02:09.009> here

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
look back to our 30 millimeter here

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.990 
look back to our 30 millimeter here
that's<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> one<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.260> 181<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.070> minute<00:02:12.340> there's

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
that's the one and 181 a minute there's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.430 
that's the one and 181 a minute there's
the<00:02:13.210> 30<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.790> other<00:02:15.970> way<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.900> bolt<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.290> our

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the 30 the other way the bolt on our

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.490 
the 30 the other way the bolt on our
spacer<00:02:23.920> you'll<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.760> work<00:02:24.880> perfect

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
spacer you'll see it work perfect

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.199 
spacer you'll see it work perfect
and<00:02:26.500> now<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.770> flywheel

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.070 

make<00:02:33.780> sure<00:02:33.959> our<00:02:33.989> little<00:02:34.400> keyway

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
make sure our little keyway

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920 
make sure our little keyway
sometimes<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.720> slotted<00:02:39.720> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
sometimes if the little slotted you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.390 
sometimes if the little slotted you
groove<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:42.300> holds<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:45.920> let's<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:47.100> maybe<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
groove that holds it let's see maybe a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.870 
groove that holds it let's see maybe a
little<00:02:47.490> bit<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.730> prying<00:02:48.000> here

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.010 

oftentimes<00:02:56.880> they'll<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.330> come<00:02:57.540> off<00:02:57.690> when

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
oftentimes they'll just come off when

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.200 
oftentimes they'll just come off when
they<00:02:58.170> let<00:02:58.410> loose<00:02:58.460> it'll<00:02:59.460> sound<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.910> somebody

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
they let loose it'll sound like somebody

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.900 
they let loose it'll sound like somebody
shot<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> gun<00:03:00.720> right<00:03:00.960> near<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.320> bang<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.760> then

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
shot a gun right near you bang and then

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.630 
shot a gun right near you bang and then
it's<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.180> flow<00:03:03.420> flopping<00:03:03.960> around<00:03:04.050> crank

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
it's just flow flopping around crank

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.340 
it's just flow flopping around crank
there's<00:03:05.640> where<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.910> got<00:03:06.090> cranks<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> little<00:03:07.260> bit

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
there's where we got cranks a little bit

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.400 
there's where we got cranks a little bit
ugly<00:03:08.270> this<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.420> really<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> first<00:03:09.930> glance<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
ugly this is really the first glance you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.480 
ugly this is really the first glance you
get<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.740> what<00:03:10.860> kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.070> condition

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
get it what kind of condition

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.900 
get it what kind of condition
everything's<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.360> too<00:03:12.540> horrible<00:03:13.910> but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
everything's in not too horrible but

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.970 
everything's in not too horrible but
this<00:03:15.060> thing's<00:03:15.270> had<00:03:15.450> some<00:03:15.660> look<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.680> chunk

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
this thing's had some look at that chunk

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.450 
this thing's had some look at that chunk
missing<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.610> inside<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.210> disc<00:03:19.460> it's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
missing on the inside of the disc it's

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.550 
missing on the inside of the disc it's
taking<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.850> bite<00:03:21.000> out<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.210> something<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.840> see

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
taking a bite out of something you see

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.050 
taking a bite out of something you see
the<00:03:22.680> chunk<00:03:22.920> missing<00:03:23.130> over<00:03:23.520> here<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the chunk missing over here and the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.200 
the chunk missing over here and the
mature<00:03:25.050> it's<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.320> camera<00:03:25.740> but<00:03:26.000> you've<00:03:27.000> got<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
mature it's in camera but you've got a

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.920 
mature it's in camera but you've got a
broken<00:03:27.510> disk<00:03:27.930> spline<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:30.450> anyway<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.870> is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
broken disk spline but anyway this is

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.570 
broken disk spline but anyway this is
the<00:03:31.050> Berto<00:03:31.470> setup<00:03:31.830> we're<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:32.160> planning<00:03:32.490> on

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
the Berto setup we're not planning on

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.310 
the Berto setup we're not planning on
using<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.940> part<00:03:33.750> get<00:03:33.870> out<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.140> way<00:03:34.260> for

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
using that part get out of the way for

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.260 
using that part get out of the way for
now<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.040> look<00:03:38.250> at<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.730> yes<00:03:39.030> yeah

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
now have a look at what we have yes yeah

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.830 
now have a look at what we have yes yeah
this<00:03:40.400> again<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> hope<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:42.000> all<00:03:42.150> showing

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
this again I hope this is all showing

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.290 
this again I hope this is all showing
but<00:03:43.220> when<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> turned<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.640> engine<00:03:45.000> when<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> turn

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
but when I turned the engine when I turn

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.270 
but when I turned the engine when I turn
the<00:03:45.480> crank<00:03:45.690> over<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.320> washer<00:03:46.830> had<00:03:47.070> perhaps

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
the crank over this washer had perhaps

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.210 
the crank over this washer had perhaps
slipped<00:03:48.030> upward<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:49.470> binding<00:03:49.680> against

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
slipped upward and was binding against

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.580 
slipped upward and was binding against
the<00:03:50.340> flywheel<00:03:50.730> flange<00:03:51.140> when<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> turned<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
the flywheel flange when I turned it

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.550 
the flywheel flange when I turned it
over<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:53.640> wobbled<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.209> fell<00:03:55.170> back<00:03:55.380> into

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
over and just wobbled it fell back into

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.229 
over and just wobbled it fell back into
the<00:03:55.739> groove<00:03:55.950> allowing<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.610> flywheel<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.120> come

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
the groove allowing the flywheel to come

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.229 
the groove allowing the flywheel to come
off<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.800> book<00:03:59.010> says<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.459> put<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.730> top<00:04:00.000> dead

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
off the book says to put it top dead

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.910 
off the book says to put it top dead
center<00:04:00.600> for<00:04:00.780> number<00:04:01.019> one<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.230> sure<00:04:01.530> enough<00:04:01.800> we

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
center for number one and sure enough we

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.500 
center for number one and sure enough we
got<00:04:02.040> top<00:04:02.280> dead<00:04:02.489> center<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:02.850> number<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.330> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
got top dead center and number one and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.490 
got top dead center and number one and
four<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.530> point<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.100> slot<00:04:05.600> upward

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
the ring behind it finally the primary

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.170 
the ring behind it finally the primary
gear<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.430> we're<00:04:17.579> not<00:04:17.700> going<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.910> pull<00:04:18.060> the

gear out until we pull the housing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.160 
gear out until we pull the housing
because<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.390> don't<00:04:21.540> want<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> rip<00:04:22.109> it

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.020 

I've<00:04:38.590> got<00:04:38.710> very<00:04:38.919> dirty<00:04:39.100> hands<00:04:39.430> now<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:39.880> here

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
I've got very dirty hands now but here

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.219 
I've got very dirty hands now but here
we<00:04:40.120> go<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.389> see<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.840> there's<00:04:44.020> been<00:04:44.080> some

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
we go you can see that there's been some

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.710 
we go you can see that there's been some
kind<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:45.009> little<00:04:45.669> bit<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.880> cold<00:04:46.180> welding

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
kind of a little bit of cold welding

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.670 
kind of a little bit of cold welding
going<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.229> here<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:48.750> part<00:04:49.750> 2.2<00:04:50.289> but<00:04:50.500> right

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
going on here on the part 2.2 but right

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.360 
going on here on the part 2.2 but right
there<00:04:52.199> from<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.350> flywheel<00:04:53.560> perhaps<00:04:54.130> not

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
there from the flywheel perhaps not

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.400 
there from the flywheel perhaps not
being<00:04:54.580> installed<00:04:55.000> perfectly<00:04:55.570> well<00:04:55.720> we'll<00:04:56.229> see

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
being installed perfectly well we'll see

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.689 
being installed perfectly well we'll see
what<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.650> rest<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.039> crank<00:04:57.250> looks<00:04:57.400> like

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
what the rest of the crank looks like

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.820 
what the rest of the crank looks like
and<00:04:58.539> decide<00:04:58.840> if<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.139> something<00:04:59.440> we<00:04:59.680> can

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
and decide if that's something we can

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.560 
and decide if that's something we can
live<00:05:00.039> with<00:05:00.220> or<00:05:00.340> not<00:05:01.590> any<00:05:02.590> rain<00:05:03.210> they're<00:05:04.210> taking

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
live with or not any rain they're taking

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.090 
live with or not any rain they're taking
off<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.870> flywheel<00:05:05.289> with<00:05:05.500> just<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.770> few<00:05:05.919> basic

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
off the flywheel with just a few basic

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.410 
off the flywheel with just a few basic
tools<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.630> which<00:05:07.780> can<00:05:08.020> make<00:05:08.169> work
