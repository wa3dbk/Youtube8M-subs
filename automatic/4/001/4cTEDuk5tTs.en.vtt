this is sort of this is a hierarchy

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.499 
this is sort of this is a hierarchy
that's<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:02.979> transition<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.179> this<00:02:04.270> were<00:02:04.450> an

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
that's in transition so if this were an
