pretty oldest from 68 or 62 hold on i'll
check<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> other<00:00:22.289> side<00:00:24.019> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:26.810> 68<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.490> i

check on the other side it is 68 and i

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.000 
check on the other side it is 68 and i
want<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> put<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.690> this<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> problem

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
want to put it on this but the problem

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.270 
want to put it on this but the problem
is<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.320> aluminum<00:00:40.829> frame<00:00:41.870> this<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.890> made

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is it's an aluminum frame this is made

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.040 
is it's an aluminum frame this is made
out<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.640> steel<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.629> i<00:00:46.789> can't<00:00:47.789> weld<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.829> i

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
out of steel so i can't weld it on but i

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
out of steel so i can't weld it on but i
could<00:00:52.050> probably<00:00:52.559> build<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.280> frame<00:00:53.579> or

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
could probably build a frame or

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
could probably build a frame or
something<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:55.140> reason<00:00:55.500> i'm<00:00:55.590> making<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
something the reason i'm making this

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
something the reason i'm making this

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this thing is going to work so the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.580 
this thing is going to work so the
engine<00:01:08.520> goes<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.110> course<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:12.590> what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
engine goes on there of course and what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.840 
engine goes on there of course and what
I'm<00:01:13.710> doing<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:15.170> for<00:01:16.170> breaks<00:01:16.470> I've<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:18.770> little

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
I'm doing is for breaks I've got little

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.100 
I'm doing is for breaks I've got little
pads<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.780 

they<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.409> hold<00:01:25.649> on<00:01:25.829> that<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
they don't really hold on that well but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.960 
they don't really hold on that well but
I'll<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.810> any<00:01:27.960> front<00:01:28.229> brakes<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.970> little

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I'll have any front brakes a little

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
I'll have any front brakes a little
light<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:36.170> my<00:01:37.170> neighbor<00:01:37.759> hopefully<00:01:38.759> said<00:01:39.360> he

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
light and my neighbor hopefully said he

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.219 
light and my neighbor hopefully said he
would<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:39.810> me<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> gas<00:01:40.770> tank<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:45.140> fixed<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
would make me a gas tank I fixed the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.719 
would make me a gas tank I fixed the
pedals<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> they're<00:01:48.149> aligned<00:01:48.720> together

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
pedals so that they're aligned together

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.600 
pedals so that they're aligned together
so<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:51.659> my<00:01:51.780> feet<00:01:52.049> I'll<00:01:52.229> love<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.770> weight

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so put my feet I'll love them on weight

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.320 
so put my feet I'll love them on weight
in<00:01:53.789> this<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.630> gap<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.850> right<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.060> I'll

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
in this little gap here right here I'll

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.410 
in this little gap here right here I'll
just<00:01:57.600> put<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:57.899> tick<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.470> weld<00:01:58.679> on<00:01:58.890> there

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
just put a little tick of weld on there

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.490 
just put a little tick of weld on there
so<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.569> stays<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.799> high<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:06.500> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so it stays up about this high and so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.080 
so it stays up about this high and so
yeah<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.860> about<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:10.340> was<00:02:11.340> wondering<00:02:11.880> if

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
yeah that's about it I was wondering if

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.009 
yeah that's about it I was wondering if
you<00:02:12.630> guys<00:02:12.780> could<00:02:12.890> figure<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.720> there's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> way

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
you guys could figure out there's a way

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.320 
you guys could figure out there's a way
that<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> could<00:02:16.470> put<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> made

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that I could put this on so this is made

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.530 
that I could put this on so this is made
out<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> aluminum<00:02:19.819> just<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> kickstand<00:02:21.420> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
out of aluminum just the kickstand is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.370 
out of aluminum just the kickstand is
underneath<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> can't<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
underneath so I can't really do much the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.900 
underneath so I can't really do much the
engine<00:02:25.769> here<00:02:26.549> I'll<00:02:26.670> show<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.150> end

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
engine here I'll show you at the end

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.620 
engine here I'll show you at the end
when<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.430> could<00:02:33.269> pick<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.570> thing

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
when it's on so I could pick this thing

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.210 
when it's on so I could pick this thing
up<00:02:33.840> Omaha<00:02:34.519> pick<00:02:35.519> up<00:02:35.670> by<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> carb<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.160> need<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
up Omaha pick up by the carb I need to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:50.809 
up Omaha pick up by the carb I need to
put<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.489> upper<00:02:38.880> side

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.920 

so<00:02:51.819> that's<00:02:54.300> pretty<00:02:55.300> much<00:02:55.390> how<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.780> going<00:02:55.900> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
so that's pretty much how it's going to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.420 
so that's pretty much how it's going to
work<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.330> look<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> little<00:02:58.630> weird<00:02:58.959> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
work going to look a little weird a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.449 
work going to look a little weird a
little<00:03:00.430> too<00:03:00.580> big<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.060> frame<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.280> air

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
little too big for the frame in the air

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:14.090 
little too big for the frame in the air
the<00:03:07.230> intake<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:10.000> little<00:03:10.270> bit<00:03:10.720> too<00:03:11.350> high<00:03:13.080> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
the intake it's a little bit too high so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.490 
the intake it's a little bit too high so
we'll<00:03:15.100> see<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:16.360> fine<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.900> have<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.080> little

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
we'll see it's fine if I have a little

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.030 
we'll see it's fine if I have a little
bit<00:03:17.590> off<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.010> side<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.739> much<00:03:20.739> kind

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
bit off to the side like that much kind

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.340 
bit off to the side like that much kind
of<00:03:21.100> thing<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.500> yeah<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> need<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.070> put<00:03:28.170> make<00:03:29.170> it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
of thing so yeah I need to put make it
