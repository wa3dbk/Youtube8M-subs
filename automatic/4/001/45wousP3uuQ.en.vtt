we got trick life 101 play on adventure

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.690 
we got trick life 101 play on adventure
mode<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.469> not<00:00:13.620> sure<00:00:13.830> how<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.040> would<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
mode I'm not sure how I would do that I

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330 
mode I'm not sure how I would do that I
would<00:00:14.790> probably<00:00:15.440> just<00:00:16.440> follow<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> rules<00:00:17.039> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
would probably just follow the rules but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010 
would probably just follow the rules but
I<00:00:17.550> fly<00:00:17.789> around<00:00:17.940> when<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:18.720> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I fly around when I do it I think it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
I fly around when I do it I think it
just<00:00:19.230> works<00:00:19.500> easier<00:00:19.920> because<00:00:20.070> when<00:00:20.310> you're

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
just works easier because when you're

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.640 
just works easier because when you're
drawing<00:00:20.640> players<00:00:21.630> take<00:00:21.869> turned<00:00:22.109> wrong<00:00:22.320> use

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
drawing players take turned wrong use

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
drawing players take turned wrong use
redstone<00:00:23.010> torches<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.519> draw<00:00:23.730> round<00:00:24.300> over<00:00:24.660> when

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
redstone torches to draw round over when

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
redstone torches to draw round over when
water<00:00:25.050> clears<00:00:25.410> board<00:00:25.740> keep<00:00:25.980> score<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.340> board

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
water clears board keep score on board

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
water clears board keep score on board
I'm<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:28.080> stoked<00:00:28.349> honestly<00:00:28.890> after<00:00:29.160> playing

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I'm really stoked honestly after playing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
I'm really stoked honestly after playing
around<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.179> map<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:30.929> I'm

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.749 
around with this map right now I'm
definitely<00:00:31.800> gonna<00:00:31.859> bring<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> my

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
definitely gonna bring this over to my

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
definitely gonna bring this over to my
ps4<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.600> play<00:00:33.809> some<00:00:33.989> games<00:00:34.230> with

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.780 
ps4 and I'm gonna play some games with
some<00:00:34.649> friends<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.130> maybe<00:00:35.309> there'll<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
some friends so maybe there'll be a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
some friends so maybe there'll be a
little<00:00:36.000> bit<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> show<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.230> don't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
little bit of a show about it I don't

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.350 
little bit of a show about it I don't

know we'll see but I think it's gonna be
super<00:00:39.690> cool<00:00:39.739> only<00:00:40.739> person<00:00:41.070> drawing<00:00:41.280> takes<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
super cool only person drawing takes a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
super cool only person drawing takes a

but<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.960> note<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.470> didn't<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:11.800> enough

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
but on that note I didn't have enough

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.040 
but on that note I didn't have enough
time<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.490> came<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:13.030> close<00:04:13.060> actually<00:04:13.570> nowhere

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
time I came so close actually nowhere

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.420 
time I came so close actually nowhere
near<00:04:14.200> because<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.440> still<00:04:14.650> had<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.920> do<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.160> Styx

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
near because I still had to do the Styx

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.240 
near because I still had to do the Styx
I<00:04:16.060> guess<00:04:16.720> if<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.049> really<00:04:17.440> wanted<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:17.980> know

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
I guess if you really wanted to you know

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.800 
I guess if you really wanted to you know
if<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.610> have<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.880> little<00:04:19.299> bit<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.480> redstone

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
if you have a little bit of redstone

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.100 
if you have a little bit of redstone
smarts<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:21.160> easily<00:04:21.459> extend<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.390> with

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
smarts you could easily extend this with

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.540 
smarts you could easily extend this with
very<00:04:23.500> little<00:04:23.800> problem<00:04:24.100> all<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.250> would<00:04:24.460> have

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
very little problem all you would have

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.600 
very little problem all you would have
to<00:04:24.640> do<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.120> go<00:04:25.570> over<00:04:25.600> here<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.340> put<00:04:27.340> more

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
to do is go over here and put more

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.310 
to do is go over here and put more
repeaters<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.210> then<00:04:28.660> just<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.170> end

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
repeaters and then just on the end

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.780 
repeaters and then just on the end
connect<00:04:29.680> them<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.010> like<00:04:30.130> this<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.550> could

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
connect them just like this so you could

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.220 
connect them just like this so you could
make<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> have<00:04:31.240> much<00:04:31.480> more<00:04:31.690> time<00:04:31.960> if<00:04:32.140> you

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
make it have much more time if you

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.950 
make it have much more time if you
really<00:04:32.440> wanted<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.940> again<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.450> think<00:04:34.600> trick
