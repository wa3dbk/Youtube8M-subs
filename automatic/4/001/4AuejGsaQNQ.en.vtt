there<00:00:43.559> 6<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> 5<00:00:44.430> watts<00:00:44.730> each<00:00:44.969> who<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.840> doing

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
there 6 to 5 watts each who was doing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.280 
I can add some fans so here's my tank
with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> fluorescence<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.290> don't

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
with the fluorescence on there I don't

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
with the fluorescence on there I don't
know<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.590> brand<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.130> says<00:01:35.310> they're<00:01:35.549> top

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
know what brand it says they're top

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.660 
know what brand it says they're top
something<00:01:36.420> aquarium<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.280> tells<00:01:38.520> me

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
something aquarium but that tells me

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.740 
something aquarium but that tells me
nothing<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.060> couldn't<00:01:39.329> find<00:01:39.479> any<00:01:39.689> information

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
nothing I couldn't find any information

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
nothing I couldn't find any information
on<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.920> yeah<00:01:41.040> there's<00:01:41.250> two<00:01:41.460> bulbs<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
on but yeah there's two bulbs in the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
on but yeah there's two bulbs in the
back<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:43.290> bulbs<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.680> front<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> mean<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.340> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
back or two bulbs up front I mean one in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.330 
back or two bulbs up front I mean one in
the<00:01:44.549> back<00:01:46.970> there's<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.350> 10k<00:01:49.350> bulbs<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.070> front

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the back there's two 10k bulbs up front

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
the back there's two 10k bulbs up front
and<00:01:50.930> 160<00:01:51.930> 500k<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:54.649> this<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> think

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and 160 500k in the back so this I think

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
and 160 500k in the back so this I think
this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> gonna<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.759> brighter<00:01:57.060> than

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
this is gonna be a little brighter than

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.770 
this is gonna be a little brighter than
my<00:01:57.479> LEDs<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.170> we'll<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.850> we<00:01:59.850> shall<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
my LEDs but we'll see we shall see so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.219 
my LEDs but we'll see we shall see so
there<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.680> off<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> back<00:02:04.170> on

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.900 

let's<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.560> LEDs<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.429> box<00:02:08.640> man

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
let's get these LEDs out of the box man

00:02:08.910 --> 00:03:02.900 
let's get these LEDs out of the box man
let's<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.690> there

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.550 

so<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:04.840> got<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.080> expandable

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so there it is it's got the expandable

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.870 
so there it is it's got the expandable
bracket<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.040> think<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.310> can<00:03:06.490> put<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.760> on

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
bracket I think you can put it on

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.650 
bracket I think you can put it on
something<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.780> 52<00:03:08.140> inches<00:03:08.380> long<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.360> got

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
something that's 52 inches long it's got

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.280 
something that's 52 inches long it's got
four<00:03:10.930> rows<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.760> 16<00:03:12.760> LEDs<00:03:13.300> each<00:03:13.600> three<00:03:14.050> watts

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
four rows of 16 LEDs each three watts

00:03:14.290 --> 00:04:08.920 
four rows of 16 LEDs each three watts
each<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.820> yeah<00:03:16.260> let's<00:03:17.260> get<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.950> there

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.600 

so<00:04:09.930> there's<00:04:10.170> two<00:04:10.409> switches<00:04:10.769> there<00:04:11.310> was<00:04:11.430> two

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
so there's two switches there was two

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.899 
so there's two switches there was two
cords<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.030> had<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> plug<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.569> two<00:04:12.720> cords<00:04:13.140> at<00:04:13.909> one

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
cords I had a plug in two cords at one

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.939 
cords I had a plug in two cords at one
for<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.269> back<00:04:15.840> row<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.139> one<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.859> front

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
for the back row and one for the front

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.409 
for the back row and one for the front
row<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.789> there's<00:04:18.329> two<00:04:18.539> options<00:04:18.739> for<00:04:19.739> each<00:04:19.979> one

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
row and there's two options for each one

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.469 
row and there's two options for each one
or<00:04:21.419> each<00:04:21.539> switch<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:22.979> have<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.430> few<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.120> on

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
or each switch you can have a few on on

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.450 
or each switch you can have a few on on
the<00:04:24.780> back<00:04:24.960> or<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.530> want<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.919> front<00:04:26.190> or

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the back or if you want in the front or

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.700 
the back or if you want in the front or
you<00:04:26.610> can<00:04:26.760> have<00:04:26.910> them<00:04:27.000> all<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.440> that's<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:28.590> I'm

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
you can have them all on that's what I'm

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.230 
you can have them all on that's what I'm
showing<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.010> here<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.680> with<00:04:35.669> just

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
showing you here so that is with just

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:49.150 
showing you here so that is with just
the<00:04:36.419> back<00:04:36.630> row<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:38.000> all<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.300> them<00:04:39.419> on

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.390 

and<00:04:49.930> i'ma<00:04:50.930> show<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.170> what<00:04:52.010> they<00:04:52.160> look<00:04:52.370> like

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
and i'ma show you what they look like

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.880 
and i'ma show you what they look like
you<00:04:53.030> know<00:04:55.210> with<00:04:56.210> them<00:04:56.360> all<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:56.750> or<00:04:57.020> front<00:04:57.710> on

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
you know with them all on or front on

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.080 
you know with them all on or front on
but<00:05:00.040> here's<00:05:01.040> what<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.430> can<00:05:01.700> do<00:05:01.850> with<00:05:02.000> the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
but here's what you can do with the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.860 
but here's what you can do with the
light<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:06.490> light<00:05:07.490> was<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.820> lot<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.270> lot<00:05:08.540> wider

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
light the light was a lot a lot wider

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.870 
light the light was a lot a lot wider
than<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.260> thought<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.620> would<00:05:09.770> be<00:05:09.950> but<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.580> guess

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
than I thought it would be but I guess

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.660 
than I thought it would be but I guess
four<00:05:11.120> rows<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.540> these<00:05:12.290> three<00:05:12.680> watt<00:05:12.830> LEDs<00:05:13.340> it's

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
four rows of these three watt LEDs it's

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:22.150 
four rows of these three watt LEDs it's
pretty<00:05:13.940> wide<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:20.350> there's<00:05:21.350> all<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.740> LEDs

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
pretty wide so there's all the LEDs

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.920 
pretty wide so there's all the LEDs
which<00:05:22.460> out<00:05:22.750> matera<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.930> right<00:05:24.140> now<00:05:25.750> that's<00:05:26.750> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
which out matera on right now that's the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.690 
which out matera on right now that's the
front<00:05:27.170> just<00:05:27.530> that's<00:05:27.800> just<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:28.070> few<00:05:28.310> one<00:05:28.460> in<00:05:28.610> the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
front just that's just a few one in the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.400 
front just that's just a few one in the
front<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.120> think<00:05:29.240> there's<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.720> six<00:05:30.200> or<00:05:30.350> seven

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
front I think there's like six or seven

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:42.469 
front I think there's like six or seven
of<00:05:30.800> them<00:05:30.890> on<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:33.230> that's<00:05:33.410> all<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.800> them<00:05:33.920> on

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.929 

so<00:05:43.479> here's<00:05:43.719> a<00:05:43.809> comparison<00:05:44.369> top<00:05:45.369> picture<00:05:45.609> being

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
so here's a comparison top picture being

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.209 
so here's a comparison top picture being
the<00:05:46.239> new<00:05:46.359> LEDs<00:05:46.809> I<00:05:46.989> got<00:05:47.169> bottom<00:05:47.709> being<00:05:48.039> the

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
the new LEDs I got bottom being the

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.879 
the new LEDs I got bottom being the
compact<00:05:48.669> fluorescent<00:05:48.759> fixture<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:50.469> compact

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
compact fluorescent fixture the compact

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.019 
compact fluorescent fixture the compact
fluorescent<00:05:51.039> gonna<00:05:51.519> be<00:05:51.579> a<00:05:51.609> little<00:05:51.819> brighter

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
fluorescent gonna be a little brighter

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.659 
fluorescent gonna be a little brighter
because<00:05:52.299> it's<00:05:52.569> got<00:05:52.719> two<00:05:52.899> 10ks<00:05:53.439> and<00:05:53.619> one<00:05:53.799> 6500

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
because it's got two 10ks and one 6500

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.489 
because it's got two 10ks and one 6500
but<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:54.999> think<00:05:55.449> the<00:05:55.539> LEDs<00:05:55.899> look<00:05:56.109> sharp<00:05:56.379> man<00:05:58.499> yo

00:05:59.489 --> 00:05:59.499 
but I think the LEDs look sharp man yo

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:01.829 
but I think the LEDs look sharp man yo
what<00:05:59.679> up<00:05:59.709> come<00:05:59.979> back<00:06:00.239> gonna<00:06:01.239> finish<00:06:01.479> my<00:06:01.689> video

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
what up come back gonna finish my video

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.619 
what up come back gonna finish my video
earlier<00:06:02.409> but<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.279> got<00:06:03.429> the<00:06:03.519> kids<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:03.939> bed<00:06:04.119> so

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
earlier but I got the kids to bed so

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.679 
earlier but I got the kids to bed so
we've<00:06:05.259> got<00:06:05.379> a<00:06:05.409> lot<00:06:05.619> of<00:06:05.649> time<00:06:05.859> now<00:06:06.479> but<00:06:07.479> yeah

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
we've got a lot of time now but yeah

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.239 
we've got a lot of time now but yeah
there<00:06:07.899> it<00:06:08.019> is<00:06:08.109> the<00:06:08.439> comparison<00:06:08.979> between<00:06:09.069> the

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:09.249 
there it is the comparison between the

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.209 
there it is the comparison between the
two<00:06:09.339> lights<00:06:09.699> the<00:06:10.389> unboxing<00:06:10.959> of<00:06:11.049> my<00:06:11.109> new<00:06:11.829> green

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
two lights the unboxing of my new green

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.969 
two lights the unboxing of my new green
element<00:06:12.669> vivo<00:06:13.569> pod<00:06:14.189> 3<00:06:15.189> watt<00:06:15.689> LEDs<00:06:16.769> 64<00:06:17.769> of<00:06:17.860> them

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
element vivo pod 3 watt LEDs 64 of them

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.189 
element vivo pod 3 watt LEDs 64 of them
