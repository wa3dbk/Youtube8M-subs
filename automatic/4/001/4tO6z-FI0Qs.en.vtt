00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.450
 gigantic than a friend 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.279
 this looks to be a bit 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 complicated but at the same time they are these 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.750
 typical ramp that are misplaced and the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.029

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.840
 nobody because that and everybody else what 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.430

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.720
