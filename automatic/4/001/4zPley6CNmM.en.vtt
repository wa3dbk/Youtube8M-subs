life was good see it has these pulled up
sleeves<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.899> actually<00:02:04.079> fold<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.920> one

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
sleeves and they actually fold up one

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
sleeves and they actually fold up one
less<00:02:05.549> than<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.210> thought<00:02:06.360> look<00:02:06.570> cuter

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
less than this but I thought look cuter

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.389 
less than this but I thought look cuter
if<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> fold<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> little<00:02:07.860> bit<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
if I fold it up a little bit more so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
if I fold it up a little bit more so
it's<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.789> right<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
it's kind of like right here so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's kind of like right here so
it<00:02:11.190> looks<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.490> great<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.420> put<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.720> on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it looks really great I would put it on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.060 
it looks really great I would put it on
but<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.260> doesn't<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.500> match<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:13.800> I'm

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
but it doesn't really match what I'm

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.020 
but it doesn't really match what I'm
wearing<00:02:14.250> today<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.640> don't<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.910> the

inside it just has the whole pinstripe

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.620 
inside it just has the whole pinstripe
for<00:02:20.100> only<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.580> bit<00:02:20.820> part<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.510> in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
for only a little bit part of it just in

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.390

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
case it's like peeking out but the rest

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.010 
case it's like peeking out but the rest
of<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.150> pattern<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.840> this

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
of it is just this pattern or this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.890 
of it is just this pattern or this
fabric<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.270> great<00:02:27.540> actually

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
fabric and this is really great actually

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.270 
fabric and this is really great actually
has<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.290> bit<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.620> shoulder<00:02:28.950> padding

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
has a little bit of shoulder padding

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.010 
has a little bit of shoulder padding
though<00:02:29.700> base<00:02:29.910> your<00:02:30.090> shoulders<00:02:30.390> look<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.900> little

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
though base your shoulders look a little

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.540 
though base your shoulders look a little
bit<00:02:31.230> broader<00:02:31.560> me<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> already<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.370> broad

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
bit broader me if you already have broad

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.860 
bit broader me if you already have broad
shoulders<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.060> might<00:02:33.210> not<00:02:33.330> want<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.600> wear<00:02:33.660> one

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
