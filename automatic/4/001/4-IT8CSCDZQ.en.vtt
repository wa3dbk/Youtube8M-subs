00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.720

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.660
 m 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.759
 in fact in September 2007 included or 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.829
 less of your kids to try to 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.480
 to find us in France 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.279
 in a place where it's good to do 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.420
 bikes from the group evs and from 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.400
 girls started in Auvergne that we 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.230
 do not go well anymore they went to 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.050
 little bit more in the south east and a 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.730
 evening we said but in fact we 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.409
 let's cancel all other appointments 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 that we have planned for the 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.920
 vacation 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.559
 in other regions to return 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.689
 in Auvergne they chose us 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.689
 install here and we no regret 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 so they created little of me 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.470
 join until September 26th all 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 the days our role will be closed the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.200
 morning saying that the group will do without 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.030
 robert will be closed on monday morning the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 for jen is on Tuesday and sentenced for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.789
 have Wednesday and Thursday 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.250
 the portage course is there actually 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:51.720
 is closed except that cyclists 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 people who live around you I 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 thought very well it's a great 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 advertising for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.500
 the massif du sancy also for the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.810
 fresh air deliverers actually for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 the auvergne in total because in fact there 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.939
 there are a lot of people who always leave 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 in the Alps or the Pyrenees but in 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.289
 done here I find in cycling 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 it is ideal because there are many 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 but really a lot of little road 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.720
 with no cob circulation 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.400
 strapping or 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.370
 we can make small out of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.880
 long trips throughout the massive it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.880
 should coll 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.939
 a little word today before the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:41.280
 descent everything and that means then at the 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.400
 see again in Auvergne where life is very 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 pretty 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580
