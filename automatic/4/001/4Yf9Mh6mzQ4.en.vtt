00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
tested and this is with nylon cord ropes

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.450 
tested and this is with nylon cord ropes
where<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:48.050> ropes<00:00:48.290> fail<00:00:48.650> at<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.220> in<00:00:49.340> this

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
where the ropes fail at so in this

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.950 
where the ropes fail at so in this
particular<00:00:49.730> instance<00:00:50.150> with<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.510> half-inch

nylon cord kernmantle the ropes going to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.630 
nylon cord kernmantle the ropes going to
break<00:00:54.350> right<00:00:54.380> here<00:00:54.680> at<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.070> horn<00:00:55.310> it's<00:00:55.520> going

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
break right here at the horn it's going

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.330 
break right here at the horn it's going
to<00:00:55.700> break<00:00:55.880> it's<00:00:56.120> around<00:00:56.450> 24<00:00:56.960> kilonewtons<00:00:57.590> so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
to break it's around 24 kilonewtons so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560 
to break it's around 24 kilonewtons so
one<00:00:58.490> of<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.640> unique<00:00:58.850> features<00:00:59.240> that<00:00:59.270> we<00:00:59.420> can

you that adhere to that philosophy in
your<00:01:04.970> basal<00:01:05.330> anchoring<00:01:05.689> system<00:01:06.310> alright<00:01:07.310> it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
your basal anchoring system alright it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.760 
your basal anchoring system alright it
will<00:01:07.729> work<00:01:07.939> up<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> tree<00:01:08.689> as<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.409> lowering

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
will work up in the tree as a lowering

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.590 
will work up in the tree as a lowering
device<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.520> climber<00:01:10.789> can<00:01:11.030> lower<00:01:11.210> off<00:01:11.420> his

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
device so the climber can lower off his

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.139 
device so the climber can lower off his
own<00:01:11.749> woody<00:01:11.990> material<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:13.219> a<00:01:13.249> Highline<00:01:13.700> angle

own woody material with a Highline angle

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.480 
own woody material with a Highline angle
you<00:01:14.780> can<00:01:14.929> also<00:01:15.109> use<00:01:15.469> it<00:01:15.679> when<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:15.950> tension<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
you can also use it when you tension the

really well because it's a compact unit
it's<00:01:27.079> very<00:01:27.289> easy<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.829> add<00:01:28.009> or<00:01:28.369> remove<00:01:28.819> friction

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's very easy to add or remove friction

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.809 
it's very easy to add or remove friction
really<00:01:30.590> great<00:01:30.770> device<00:01:30.920> built<00:01:31.460> right<00:01:31.579> here<00:01:31.640> in

so<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:34.969> install<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.630> Scarab<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:36.950> real<00:01:37.249> easy

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
so to install the Scarab it's real easy

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.660 
so to install the Scarab it's real easy
it's<00:01:38.929> only<00:01:39.020> got<00:01:39.259> one<00:01:39.289> idiot<00:01:39.740> bar<00:01:40.069> on<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.609> it

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's only got one idiot bar on it so it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.649 
it's only got one idiot bar on it so it
makes<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.030> simple<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.630> pass<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.859> biter<00:01:43.100> rope

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.830 

slip<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.409> brake<00:01:46.590> bar<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:48.360> we've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
slip the brake bar so now we've got that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
slip the brake bar so now we've got that
biter<00:01:49.110> rope<00:01:49.409> installed<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
biter rope installed there do you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:12.880 
biter rope installed there do you
everybody<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.850> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.199 

okay<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.190> add<00:02:14.430> friction

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
okay so to add friction

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
okay so to add friction
alright<00:02:16.160> simply<00:02:17.239> come<00:02:18.239> over<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.690> horn<00:02:19.400> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
alright simply come over one horn so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.309 
alright simply come over one horn so
that<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> could<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.030> enough<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> control<00:02:21.900> 100

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
that that could be enough to control 100

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.050 
that that could be enough to control 100

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.339 
pound load if you need an additional
friction<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.709> grab<00:02:25.950> another<00:02:25.980> horn<00:02:27.290> all<00:02:28.290> right

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
friction you grab another horn all right

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.780 
friction you grab another horn all right
you<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.550> lock<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> device<00:02:30.209> off<00:02:31.790> just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you want to lock the device off just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.089 
you want to lock the device off just
simply<00:02:35.090> lock<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.239> off<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.599> boat<00:02:36.840> clean<00:02:37.110> so

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
simply lock it off like a boat clean so

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.410 
simply lock it off like a boat clean so
that<00:02:38.130> would<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.459> how<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.640> would<00:02:38.790> lock<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.269> off

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
that would be how you would lock it off

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.390 
that would be how you would lock it off
if<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.140> operator<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.769> right<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.190> by

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
if you're the operator is right here by

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.180 
if you're the operator is right here by
it<00:02:41.459> if<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.569> had<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.780> go<00:02:42.989> walk<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> truck<00:02:43.799> or

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it if I had to go walk to the truck or

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.080 
it if I had to go walk to the truck or
go<00:02:44.660> somewhere<00:02:45.660> else<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.819> would<00:02:47.819> just<00:02:47.910> simply

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
go somewhere else I would just simply

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.420 
go somewhere else I would just simply
add<00:02:48.450> another<00:02:49.280> wrap<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.630> there<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> device

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
add another wrap and so there the device

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.960 
add another wrap and so there the device
is<00:02:53.670> suitably<00:02:54.060> locked<00:02:54.390> off<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.250> walk<00:02:56.400> away

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
is suitably locked off we can walk away

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.420 
is suitably locked off we can walk away

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.030 
in lowering mode I want to stop the
loaders<00:03:11.880> add<00:03:12.150> some<00:03:12.390> tension<00:03:12.620> if<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.739> needed

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
loaders add some tension if I needed

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.690
