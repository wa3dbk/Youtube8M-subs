people<00:01:00.950> separate<00:01:01.340> those<00:01:01.489> jokes<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.720> go

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
people separate those jokes so you go

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.560 
people separate those jokes so you go
like<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.519> you're<00:01:04.519> stepping<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.180> these

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
like this you're stepping and these

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.120 
like this you're stepping and these
black<00:01:05.869> things<00:01:05.930> when<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.380> push<00:01:06.590> down<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.040> they

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
black things when you push down and they

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.120 
black things when you push down and they
go<00:01:07.280> down<00:01:07.490> with<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.710> see<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.829> going<00:01:10.039> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
go down with you and see this going to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.649 
go down with you and see this going to
touch<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.429> front<00:01:10.670> wash<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.869> back<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:12.829> heel

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
touch the front wash the back the heel

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.539 
touch the front wash the back the heel
it<00:01:14.659> comes<00:01:14.929> up<00:01:15.139> because<00:01:15.289> this<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.770> off<00:01:16.039> balance

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
it comes up because this is off balance

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.999 
it comes up because this is off balance
so<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:17.090> means<00:01:17.359> you<00:01:17.450> go<00:01:17.600> forward<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.649> when

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
so that means you go forward so when

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.099 
so that means you go forward so when
you're<00:01:19.219> out<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.369> energy<00:01:19.840> basically<00:01:20.840> gives<00:01:21.020> you

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
you're out of energy basically gives you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.870 
you're out of energy basically gives you
more<00:01:21.319> energy<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.679> move<00:01:21.799> forward<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.729> it's

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
more energy to move forward so it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.090 
more energy to move forward so it's
really<00:01:23.030> cool<00:01:23.299> technology<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:24.740> doesn't

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
really cool technology and it doesn't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.069 
really cool technology and it doesn't
