00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
which is what we have filled just now

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
which is what we have filled just now
over<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> last<00:00:55.230> hour<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
over the last hour or so so that's a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
over the last hour or so so that's a
major<00:00:57.360> level<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.230> question<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
major level now the big question is do

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.670 
major level now the big question is do
we<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.340> down<00:00:59.579> further<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.840> short<00:01:01.079> term<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
we go down further in the short term I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
we go down further in the short term I
do<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> huge<00:01:03.090> amount<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
do think this is a huge amount of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
do think this is a huge amount of
support<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.260> again<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> markets<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.189> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
support but again the markets are in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190 
support but again the markets are in
sell<00:01:05.700> mode<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.180> after<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.930> broke

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
sell mode right now after they broke

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
sell mode right now after they broke

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
talked about how JPM was showing

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.699

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
weakness up here when the markets were

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.530 
weakness up here when the markets were
still<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.130> all-time<00:04:11.459> highs<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.000> how<00:04:12.360> that

still at the all-time highs and how that

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.570 
still at the all-time highs and how that
could<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.780> situating<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> fall<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.490> the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.520 
could be situating for a fall in the
market<00:04:14.880> because<00:04:15.090> JPM<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.840> leading<00:04:16.140> stock

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the key is going to be where do we take

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.110 
the key is going to be where do we take
it<00:05:37.680> off<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> table<00:05:38.070> obviously<00:05:39.000> we've

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
it off the table obviously we've

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.909 
it off the table obviously we've
supported<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.630> 200<00:05:40.139> but<00:05:40.289> right<00:05:40.500> above<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
supported the 200 but right above the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.350 
supported the 200 but right above the
200<00:05:41.370> you<00:05:41.430> have<00:05:41.520> a<00:05:41.550> little<00:05:41.700> trend<00:05:41.970> line<00:05:42.120> right

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
200 you have a little trend line right

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.150 
200 you have a little trend line right
there<00:05:42.510> as<00:05:42.630> well<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:42.990> I'm<00:05:43.080> gauging<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:44.039> this

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
there as well so I'm gauging that this

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.650 
there as well so I'm gauging that this
is<00:05:44.310> going<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.490> be<00:05:44.610> your<00:05:44.729> target<00:05:44.970> for<00:05:45.450> this

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
is going to be your target for this

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.390 
is going to be your target for this
position<00:05:46.139> and<00:05:46.229> will<00:05:46.620> look<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.860> take<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.250> off

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
position and will look to take it off

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.700 
position and will look to take it off
right<00:05:47.610> in<00:05:47.789> that<00:05:47.910> area<00:05:47.970> okay<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.289> really<00:05:49.560> nice

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710
