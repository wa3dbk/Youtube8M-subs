00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
just going to be ahead of the curve so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.040 
just going to be ahead of the curve so
that<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.490> content<00:01:40.970> that's<00:01:41.060> being<00:01:41.210> created<00:01:41.900> on

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
that the content that's being created on

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.770 
that the content that's being created on
unbox<00:01:42.590> therapy<00:01:42.740> will<00:01:43.460> be<00:01:43.490> compatible<00:01:44.390> with

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
unbox therapy will be compatible with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.420 
unbox therapy will be compatible with
all<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:44.960> these<00:01:45.200> upcoming<00:01:45.800> displays<00:01:46.190> that

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
all of these upcoming displays that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.120 
all of these upcoming displays that
people<00:01:46.760> will<00:01:46.940> likely<00:01:47.240> be<00:01:47.659> buying<00:01:48.080> as<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
people will likely be buying as the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.010 
people will likely be buying as the
prices<00:01:49.550> come<00:01:49.760> down<00:01:50.000> which<00:01:50.270> they<00:01:50.540> already<00:01:50.810> are

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
prices come down which they already are

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.310 
prices come down which they already are

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
so anyways 4k goodness hit the original

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.750 
so anyways 4k goodness hit the original

1080p 1440p and then original for the
full<00:02:06.200> 4k<00:02:06.860> resolution<00:02:07.760> that<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.450> also<00:02:08.600> an

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
full 4k resolution that is also an

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.840 
full 4k resolution that is also an
uncompressed<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> less<00:02:10.160> compressed<00:02:10.640> video

uncompressed or a less compressed video
as<00:02:11.240> well<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.200> bitrate<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.800> higher<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.430> even

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
as well so the bitrate is higher so even

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.920 
as well so the bitrate is higher so even
if<00:02:13.730> your

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
if your

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.589 
if your
1080p<00:02:14.739> display<00:02:15.189> you<00:02:15.579> should<00:02:15.819> still<00:02:16.060> notice<00:02:16.420> a

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
1080p display you should still notice a

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.630 
1080p display you should still notice a
slight<00:02:16.959> improvement<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.650> video<00:02:17.950> quality<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
slight improvement in video quality just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.869 
slight improvement in video quality just
by<00:02:18.790> toggling<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.329> up<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.870> original<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:20.950> anyways

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
by toggling it up to original so anyways

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.550 
by toggling it up to original so anyways
