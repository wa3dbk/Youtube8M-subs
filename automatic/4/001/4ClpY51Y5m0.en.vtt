00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you see these wolves and you get a sense

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640 
you see these wolves and you get a sense
of<00:01:14.430> who's<00:01:14.700> interacting<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.010 
of who's interacting with you and then
obviously<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.700> were<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.090> issues<00:01:18.299> he<00:01:18.810> did

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
obviously there were some issues he did

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.789 
obviously there were some issues he did
have<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.909> regurgitation<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
have a little regurgitation that

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
have a little regurgitation that
sometimes<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.070> happen<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.549> wolves<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
sometimes can happen with wolves you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
sometimes can happen with wolves you
know<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.040> eat<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.759> wide<00:01:27.299> variety<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
know because they eat a wide variety of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
know because they eat a wide variety of
things<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> something<00:01:29.040> doesn't<00:01:29.310> sit

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
things and and something doesn't sit

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
things and and something doesn't sit
right<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.540> obviously<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
right with them so obviously you have to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.350 
right with them so obviously you have to
know<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> norms<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> look

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

we're<00:01:44.250> seeing<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:45.439> snow<00:01:46.439> plows

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
we're seeing a lot more snow plows

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
we're seeing a lot more snow plows
pushing<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> snow<00:01:47.729> rolling<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> snow

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
pushing the snow rolling in the snow

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.920 
pushing the snow rolling in the snow
just<00:01:49.189> overall<00:01:50.189> great<00:01:50.579> attitude<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.299> warm

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
just overall great attitude about warm

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
just overall great attitude about warm
weather<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> been<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
weather and so that's kind of been the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.490 
weather and so that's kind of been the
norm<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:56.189> Denali<00:01:56.670> started<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.600> not

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
norm and so when Denali started to not

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.550 
norm and so when Denali started to not
want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> interact<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.700> much<00:02:00.170> retreat<00:02:01.170> towards

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
want to interact as much retreat towards

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.260 
want to interact as much retreat towards
the<00:02:01.649> upper<00:02:01.979> part<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> enclosure<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the upper part of the enclosure and just

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.230 
the upper part of the enclosure and just
really<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.840> engage<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> social<00:02:05.880> group

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
really not engage with the social group

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.440 
really not engage with the social group
we<00:02:06.750> knew<00:02:06.869> something<00:02:07.290> was<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.450> declined

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we knew something was up and he declined

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.960 
we knew something was up and he declined
actually<00:02:09.989> quite<00:02:10.229> quickly<00:02:10.670> he<00:02:11.670> went<00:02:11.879> up

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
actually quite quickly he went up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.150 
actually quite quickly he went up
towards<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> top<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.840> enclosure

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
towards the top of the enclosure

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.310 
towards the top of the enclosure

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

Aiden again likes that warmer weather
and<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> snow<00:02:24.710> stimulus<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.980> rolling<00:02:26.460> on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and that snow stimulus of rolling on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.730 
and that snow stimulus of rolling on
your<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:26.960> bolts<00:02:27.960> wondering<00:02:28.380> why<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
your back and bolts wondering why is

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.230 
your back and bolts wondering why is
your<00:02:28.980> dominant<00:02:29.370> male<00:02:29.490> rolling<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:29.970> his<00:02:30.090> back

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
your dominant male rolling on his back

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.950 
your dominant male rolling on his back
like<00:02:30.450> tuna<00:02:30.900> but<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.850> kind<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.300> get<00:02:33.930> a

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
like tuna but it can kind of get a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.410 
like tuna but it can kind of get a
glance<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.410> Denali<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.640> next<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> slate

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
glance of Denali up next to the slate

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.840 
glance of Denali up next to the slate
down<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.590> he<00:02:37.710> did<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.400> his

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
down there so what he did is as his

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.750 
down there so what he did is as his
condition<00:02:39.570> declined<00:02:40.350> he<00:02:41.130> went<00:02:41.310> farther<00:02:41.520> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
condition declined he went farther and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.370 
condition declined he went farther and
farther<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.120> hill<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.660> point<00:02:42.960> was<00:02:43.110> he<00:02:43.260> was

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
farther up hill to the point was he was

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
farther up hill to the point was he was
kind<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.680> isolating<00:02:44.190> himself<00:02:44.310> from<00:02:44.700> everybody

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
kind of isolating himself from everybody

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330 
kind of isolating himself from everybody
so<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.350> problem<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.800> how<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> get<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so so the problem is how do you get a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670 
so so the problem is how do you get a
diagnosis<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.120> know<00:02:48.240> we<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:49.110> these<00:02:49.530> are

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
diagnosis you know we are these are

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.590 
diagnosis you know we are these are
social<00:02:50.040> pack<00:02:50.220> animals<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:51.300> an

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
social pack animals and you can see an

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.890 
social pack animals and you can see an
animal<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:52.410> weak<00:02:53.120> gets<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> focus<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
animal that's weak gets the focus of the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.990 
animal that's weak gets the focus of the
younger<00:02:55.200> wolves<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:56.670> had<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> be

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
younger wolves and so we had to be

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
younger wolves and so we had to be
careful<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:58.200> didn't<00:02:58.500> let<00:02:58.710> Denali

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
careful that we didn't let Denali

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.280 
careful that we didn't let Denali
decline<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.420> also<00:03:00.570> had<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.990> be<00:03:01.080> mindful

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
decline but we also had to be mindful

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.410 
decline but we also had to be mindful
that<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.830> can't<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.490> take<00:03:02.730> him<00:03:02.970> out<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.240> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that we can't just take him out of the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.980 
that we can't just take him out of the
pack<00:03:03.690> structure<00:03:04.430> take<00:03:05.430> him<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.670> vet<00:03:05.760> and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
pack structure take him to the vet and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.040 
pack structure take him to the vet and
you<00:03:06.990> know<00:03:07.220> risk<00:03:08.220> him<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.150> being<00:03:09.360> allowed<00:03:09.600> back

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
you know risk him not being allowed back

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.600 
you know risk him not being allowed back
in<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> pack<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.800> there<00:03:10.950> there's<00:03:11.430> some

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
in the pack so there there's some

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.510 
in the pack so there there's some
challenges<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.250> thing

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
challenges in this and so the one thing

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.130 
challenges in this and so the one thing
about<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.060> wolf<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.720> when<00:03:15.870> they're<00:03:15.990> not<00:03:16.110> feeling

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
about a wolf is when they're not feeling

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.500 
about a wolf is when they're not feeling
well<00:03:16.740> they're<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> little<00:03:17.520> more<00:03:17.640> tolerant<00:03:18.330> of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
well they're a little more tolerant of

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
well they're a little more tolerant of
some<00:03:18.810> things<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:19.590> did<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
some things and we actually did get a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.810 
some things and we actually did get a
blood<00:03:20.640> draw<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.440> Denali<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:23.250> first<00:03:23.610> blood

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
blood draw on Denali the first blood

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.660 
blood draw on Denali the first blood
sample<00:03:24.209> wasn't<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.750> best<00:03:24.930> which<00:03:25.230> is

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
sample wasn't the best which is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.740 
sample wasn't the best which is
sometimes<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.970> problem<00:03:27.300> you're<00:03:27.450> getting<00:03:27.690> a

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
sometimes a problem you're getting a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.230 
sometimes a problem you're getting a
diagnosis<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.560> getting<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.220> clean<00:03:29.520> sample<00:03:29.910> in

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
diagnosis you getting a clean sample in

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.850 
diagnosis you getting a clean sample in
a<00:03:30.330> wolf<00:03:30.540> pen<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.050> then<00:03:31.200> getting<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:31.770> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
a wolf pen and then getting it down to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.010 
a wolf pen and then getting it down to
the<00:03:31.950> vet<00:03:32.100> clinic<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:33.270> had<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.660> bit<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.870> an

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
the vet clinic we had a little bit of an

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.480 
the vet clinic we had a little bit of an
issue<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> diagnosis<00:03:35.190> where<00:03:35.370> we

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
issue with the diagnosis where we

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.020 
issue with the diagnosis where we
thought<00:03:35.940> he<00:03:36.090> might<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.570> had<00:03:36.750> some<00:03:37.050> more

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
thought he might have had some more

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.370 
thought he might have had some more
problems<00:03:39.030> with<00:03:39.420> his<00:03:39.570> blood<00:03:39.810> work<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.200> with

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
problems with his blood work and with

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.500 
problems with his blood work and with
his<00:03:40.470> platelets<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.190> may<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.520> been<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
his platelets that may have been you

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.910 
his platelets that may have been you
know<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> host<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.650> things<00:03:43.860> tick<00:03:44.250> related<00:03:44.700> or

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
know a host of things tick related or

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.310 
know a host of things tick related or
you<00:03:46.920> know<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> possible<00:03:47.910> autoimmune<00:03:48.750> disorder

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
you know a possible autoimmune disorder

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.620 
you know a possible autoimmune disorder
and<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.090> started<00:03:51.360> out<00:03:51.480> of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
and then you know so we started out of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.540 
and then you know so we started out of
course<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.959> treatment<00:03:52.350> but<00:03:52.530> we<00:03:53.040> didn't<00:03:53.400> feel

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
course of treatment but we didn't feel

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.330 
course of treatment but we didn't feel
very<00:03:53.790> comfortable<00:03:54.000> about<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.480> diagnosis<00:03:55.110> so

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
very comfortable about the diagnosis so

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.010 
very comfortable about the diagnosis so
after<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> couple<00:03:56.790> days<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.300> treatment<00:03:57.450> he<00:03:57.900> was

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
after a couple days of treatment he was

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.140 
after a couple days of treatment he was
improving<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.190> decided<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.790> try<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.000> get

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
improving but we decided to try to get

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.300 
improving but we decided to try to get
another<00:04:00.239> clean<00:04:01.170> blood<00:04:01.530> draw<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.830> make<00:04:02.130> sure

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
another clean blood draw to make sure

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.010 
another clean blood draw to make sure
that<00:04:02.520> we<00:04:02.670> really<00:04:03.180> knew<00:04:03.300> what<00:04:03.450> was<00:04:03.600> going<00:04:03.900> on

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
that we really knew what was going on

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.970 
that we really knew what was going on
and<00:04:04.260> lo<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.310> behold<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:06.000> second<00:04:06.570> blood<00:04:06.720> draw

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
and lo and behold the second blood draw

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.699 
and lo and behold the second blood draw
his<00:04:07.980> blood<00:04:08.450> platelets<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.660> CBC<00:04:10.140> blood

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
his blood platelets and a CBC blood

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.850 
his blood platelets and a CBC blood
count<00:04:11.250> came<00:04:11.610> back<00:04:11.820> normal<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:13.200> then<00:04:13.590> we

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
count came back normal so so then we

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.460 
count came back normal so so then we
were<00:04:14.070> more<00:04:14.670> inclined<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.930> say<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.169> know<00:04:16.350> this

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
were more inclined to say you know this

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.979 
were more inclined to say you know this
isn't<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.190> bacterial<00:04:18.090> issue<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.570> isn't

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
isn't a bacterial issue this isn't

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.550 
isn't a bacterial issue this isn't
something<00:04:19.260> thats<00:04:19.620> related<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:21.200> his<00:04:22.200> immune

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
something thats related to his immune

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.820 
something thats related to his immune
system<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:23.070> probably<00:04:23.640> more<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.830> viral

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
system is probably more like a viral

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.930 
system is probably more like a viral
condition<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.520> last<00:04:27.060> winter

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
condition and last winter

both shadow and Malik had kind of a

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.210 
both shadow and Malik had kind of a
viral<00:04:31.060> vomiting<00:04:31.750> diarrhea<00:04:32.260> overall<00:04:33.190> not

viral vomiting diarrhea overall not
feeling<00:04:33.850> very<00:04:33.880> well<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.240> we<00:04:35.140> were<00:04:35.320> fortunate

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
feeling very well so we were fortunate

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the rest of the pack seemed to occupy

the rest of the pack seemed to occupy
themselves<00:04:38.020> with<00:04:38.350> each<00:04:38.530> other<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:39.820> Luna

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
comfortable but the other wolves seemed

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.230 
comfortable but the other wolves seemed
to<00:04:58.800> stayed<00:04:59.800> near<00:05:00.160> him<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.880> was<00:05:01.000> quite

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
relationship sometimes you have to be

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.630 
relationship sometimes you have to be
mindful<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.200> wolves<00:05:05.620> can<00:05:05.800> see<00:05:06.040> weakness<00:05:06.460> and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
mindful that wolves can see weakness and

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.730 
mindful that wolves can see weakness and
take<00:05:07.240> advantage<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:07.840> other<00:05:08.080> times<00:05:08.440> you

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
take advantage of it other times you

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.980 
take advantage of it other times you
really<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:09.940> social<00:05:10.390> bond<00:05:10.570> being<00:05:10.870> a

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
really see that social bond being a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.500 
really see that social bond being a
strong<00:05:11.320> strong<00:05:11.710> part<00:05:12.070> of<00:05:12.130> their<00:05:12.510> interactions

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
strong strong part of their interactions

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.620 
strong strong part of their interactions
and<00:05:14.460> there<00:05:15.460> was<00:05:16.860> many<00:05:17.860> times<00:05:18.160> when<00:05:18.630> bolts

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630

causing too many issues Luna was a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.070 
causing too many issues Luna was a
little<00:05:27.220> bit<00:05:27.310> hard<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.790> Luna<00:05:28.090> an<00:05:28.210> aid<00:05:28.390> both<00:05:28.720> and
