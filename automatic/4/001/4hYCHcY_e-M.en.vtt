investment that I would recommend all

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.300

right<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:27.230> are<00:02:27.319> my<00:02:27.410> coach<00:02:27.650> boots<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.280> can

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
right here are my coach boots you can

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.130 
right here are my coach boots you can
see<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.000> tops<00:02:29.239> folded<00:02:29.599> over<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.989> their

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
see I have the tops folded over in their

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
see I have the tops folded over in their
fuzzy<00:02:30.349> inside<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.819> got<00:02:32.239> these

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
fuzzy inside and I actually got these

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.960 
fuzzy inside and I actually got these
because<00:02:32.989> uggs<00:02:33.379> are<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.340> popular<00:02:34.549> where<00:02:34.940> I

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
because uggs are really popular where I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
because uggs are really popular where I
live<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.690> didn't<00:02:36.019> like<00:02:36.230> them<00:02:36.799> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
live but I just didn't like them that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.650 
live but I just didn't like them that
much<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.430> thought<00:02:37.610> they<00:02:38.269> were<00:02:38.330> sort<00:02:38.599> of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
much and I thought they were sort of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.479 
much and I thought they were sort of
overused<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.440> augs<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.099> cruel<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
overused and augs are kind of cruel to

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.729 
overused and augs are kind of cruel to
animals<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.330> these<00:02:41.480> instead<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.260> you

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
animals so I got these instead and you

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.990 
animals so I got these instead and you
can<00:02:42.890> see<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.310> fold<00:02:43.549> them<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.970> that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
can see you can fold them so that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.759 
can see you can fold them so that
they're<00:02:44.269> tall<00:02:44.599> or<00:02:44.870> fold<00:02:45.230> them<00:02:45.349> down<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.739> that

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
they're tall or fold them down so that

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.120 
they're tall or fold them down so that
they're<00:02:45.980> shorter<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.690> they<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:48.019> so<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.890> so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
they're shorter and they are so so so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.039 
they're shorter and they are so so so
comfortable<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.849> do<00:02:49.910> wear<00:02:50.239> them<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.569> sex<00:02:50.840> but

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
comfortable I do wear them with sex but

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.740 
comfortable I do wear them with sex but
you<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:51.410> necessarily<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.750> these

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
you don't necessarily have to these

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.449 
you don't necessarily have to these
boots<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.140> do<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.620> spray<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
boots you do have to spray in the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.390 
boots you do have to spray in the
wintertime<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.599> that<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> snow<00:02:57.170> doesn't<00:02:57.440> get

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
wintertime so that the snow doesn't get

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.720 
wintertime so that the snow doesn't get
them<00:02:58.549> all<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.910> gross<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.420> stuff<00:03:00.730> but

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
them all like gross and stuff but

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.100 
them all like gross and stuff but
they're<00:03:01.910> really<00:03:02.120> really<00:03:02.209> pretty<00:03:02.510> there<00:03:02.750> flat

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
they're really really pretty there flat

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.490 
they're really really pretty there flat
which<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.560> nice<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.180> almost<00:03:05.780> slipper<00:03:06.290> like

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
which is nice and almost slipper like

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.750
