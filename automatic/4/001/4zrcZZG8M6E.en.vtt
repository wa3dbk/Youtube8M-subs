my late my laces loose like this I think

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
my late my laces loose like this I think
it<00:03:04.940> looks<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.209> lot<00:03:05.330> better<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:07.610> like<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
it looks a lot better this is like a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.780 
it looks a lot better this is like a
that<00:03:08.870> Nike<00:03:09.320> armor<00:03:09.769> material<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.610> they<00:03:10.640> be

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that Nike armor material that they be

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.210 
that Nike armor material that they be
wearing<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.299> on<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:12.110> elbows<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.680> knees<00:03:12.709> it

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
wearing on on the elbows and knees it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.380 
wearing on on the elbows and knees it
looks<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.519> they<00:03:13.640> incorporated<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> into

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
looks like they incorporated that into

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.660 
looks like they incorporated that into
the<00:03:14.690> whole<00:03:14.870> tongue<00:03:15.140> going<00:03:16.130> down<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.340> tongue

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the whole tongue going down the tongue

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.729 
the whole tongue going down the tongue
is<00:03:16.820> flexible<00:03:17.360> up<00:03:17.540> until<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.230> point<00:03:18.290> right

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
is flexible up until this point right

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.690 
is flexible up until this point right
here<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.330> very<00:03:20.450> point<00:03:20.840> and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
here so it is very point and

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.180 
here so it is very point and
it<00:03:21.760> becomes<00:03:22.510> one<00:03:22.750> with<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.020> shoe<00:03:23.230> right<00:03:24.010> here

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
it becomes one with the shoe right here

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.309 
it becomes one with the shoe right here
