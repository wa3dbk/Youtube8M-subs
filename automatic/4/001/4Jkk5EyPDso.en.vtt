00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 worsen the quality of our skin. 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.090
 face or even the attitude we should have 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 to have healthy skin these and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.170
 other questions from here right now 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.300
 in the flash with doctor simone rocha 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 the skin is our business card is the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 face our business card and we 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.600
 Yes, you can do a lot for 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 healthier and more beautiful and this is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.200
 in our control and this is something that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 we can make our day to day 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.940
 for example an enemy greater than that of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 three enemies are great enemies of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 skin 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 the first to the sun does not mean that the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 sun is a villain but he in excess causes 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 so the premature aging 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 appearance of wrinkles, the appearance of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 stains and it should be avoided both in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 day by day by the use of sunscreen as 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.979
 prevent them from acute exposure is not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 We 're going to go there and take that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.920
 so much of sun and get burned so this much 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
 thinking about healthier skin more 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 beautiful as well as thinking about 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.549
 prevention of skin cancer 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 then enumerating the sun is the first 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.450
 enemy of the skin 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 the second enemy to the cigarette the second 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.939
 big enemy who smokes has more wrinkles 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.299
 smokers have more obstructed skin with 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.180
 more forums with slaves with a skin 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.729
 most abused and the third is the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.040
 food you say has no secret right? 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.490
 healthy habits they should be 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.560
 both pro-health 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.729
 organism as a whole and for the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 skin health 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.020
 the use of non-specific soaps 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.909
 We used make-up 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 daily often do not clean the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.680
 skin properly or even tighten the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.479
 pimples or blackheads 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.810
 this impairs the quality of the skin 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.470
 type of treatment 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.660
 then the correct soap the sunscreen 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.820
 correct for each type of skin 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.440
 depending on the characteristics of the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.600

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.910
 person for that skin to squeeze 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.760
 pimples everyone knows that squeezing 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.130
 spines leads to scars but not scars 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.650
