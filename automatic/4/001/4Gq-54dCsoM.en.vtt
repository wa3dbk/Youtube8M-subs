00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.519
 there have been those years back when the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.590
 legend of zelda the wind waker divided 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 sharply to the fans of the saga 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 at that time the initial debut of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.520
 this game left more than one we follow 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 follower with a bitter taste in his mouth 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.210
 visual style was so radically 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.489
 different from what the deliveries of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 nintendo 64 submitted that thousands 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.480
 they observed little less than a setback and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 a lack of seriousness by the up 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 then acclaimed study developed 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 however with the passage of time and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.219
 after fully experiencing this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.230
 peculiar crossing 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 the detractors finally discovered 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 that this was a title really 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.200
 worthy to be part of the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.150
 prestigious franchise a long decade 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.880
 then the company allows us 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.220
 again to cross the vast ocean but 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.470
 now in an ostentatious remastering 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.540
 in high definition such as the edition 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.940
 original we will accompany the endearing 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.009
 tooling in an intense day with the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 order to rescue his helpless sister 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.180
 minor unfortunately and as in the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.520
 previous occasion the magical experience 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.800
 is affected by a few 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 failures in different aspects 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.270
 of the game has gone through a few 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 changes all in order to optimize the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.980
 control scheme to the capabilities of the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 wind waker gamepad this gives us the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.940
 ability to change in real time 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.190
 our inventory so that we see it 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.320
 reflected in real time on the screen 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 Touch the main Wii Remote 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 This is a change that we appreciate 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.980
 enormously since it allows you to enjoy 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.900
 with greater fluidity the action on screen 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.790
 and intuitively access the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 attachments likewise the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 presentation of the nautical charts in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.090
 the gamepad looks like a lowered addition of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.370
 heaven, that was one of the factors 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 that mostly so insufferable every 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.870
 Search for marine treasures notwithstanding 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.480
 there are also changes that are not 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.190
 all a great help we refer to the 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.020
 Motion sensor integration 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 gamepad through which you can 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.160
 direct the trajectory or the look of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 certain weapons or additional objects the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.360
 truth is that this process feels 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 too forced since you need to be 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.070
 extremely precise when moving the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.840
 huge control around that without counting 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.540
 that ends up breaking the concentration in 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.750
 critical moments fortunately this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.880
 function is complete 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.310
 optional as is the use of the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.930
 gamepad so is those who prefer a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.670
 experience more attached to the original 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.650
 can opt you can use a will you 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.720
 control it should be noted that after 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.580
 test both control schemes after 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.980
 of everything if we lean in favor of 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.810
 Useful and reliable game system 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.760
 combat is still one of the points 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 strong of this delivery mainly 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.300
 because of the great agility with which it counts 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.410
 the young incarnation of the link the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.110
 battles flow with great 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.000
 showmanship and excitement because 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.160
 he masters control the movements of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 small r are strung almost in the shape of 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.570
 a deadly dance maybe his technique and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.489
 combat is too effective after 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.800
 countless confrontations proceed without 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.540
 greater difficulty likewise we still 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 it astonishes the variety of reactions and 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.470
 tactics have enemies being 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 very different and we attack them 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 directly with the sword or if by 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.160
 otherwise we opted to attack them with 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.500
 additions perhaps the greatest legacy 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.120
 relevance in this regard be the power 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.340
 pick up weapons that occasionally 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.560
 have the adversaries and that despite not 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.600
 can conserve become a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.650
 fun alternative to face the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.629
 danger is a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.370
 that the exploration aspect follows 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.349
 being one of the subjects that is not so 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.209
 polished as we would like as in the 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.950
 original release the first few times 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.079
 that we sailed the ocean were 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 unforgettable especially while 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.829
 we contemplated its immensity that we 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
 attracted to know even the smallest 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.359
 element that conformed him with the step 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.069
 of each game session is disturbing and 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.200
 entertaining feeling of navigation 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.959
 began to turn into boredom and 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.959
 clear boredom there are many islands 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.670
 in that colossal map but few really 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.799
 they have a large extension of 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.230
 ground to explore and if that were not enough 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.970
 the journeys between each point are usually 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.069
 be very pronounced and inclusive 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.079
 sleeping pills since it rarely happens 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.030
 something transcendental in them 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.010
 Topping our already little interest in 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.769
 said component of the adventure we should 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.750
 Constantly execute the manual change 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.150
 of the direction of the wind which 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.220
 we swear it raises considerably the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.289
 playing time at and turning a little 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.780
 complaints that this caused in the version of 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.240
 game cube edition xxvi integrates a 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.039
 additional object called suite 6 that is 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.110
 basically an alternative sail for 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.220
 our boat which drives it to 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.290
 double your speed 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.420
 blessed be it eliminates the need for 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.250
 change the direction of the wind 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.410
 incessantly the bad thing is that the way 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.900
 of getting this special accessory is 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.730
 quite elusive so it would be very 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.800
 easy for any player to pass 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.200
 long the day without even observing 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.450
 we have to say that at least one 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.850
 of the most boring project tasks 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.800
 original has been optimized avoiding us in 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.870
 much of the annoyance that came to us 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.030
 provoke our particular point of 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.160
 view this is still the title more 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.630
 outstanding in the visual section of 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.570
 the whole saga the visual style 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.250
 selected allowed us to numa and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.560
 company show a quantity of 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.780
 details before only imagined that without 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.730
 doubt they make you feel truly alive 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.440
 just look at the protagonist's clothes 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.350
 discover below the torrential 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.780
 storms or the expressions of each 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.940
 character or being part of him 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.190
 now we can appreciate all this in 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.860
 glorious high definition to a 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.370
 1080p resolution and 60 frames per 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.470
 second 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.840
 everything would sound ideal until on screen 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.760
 it is remarkable that the exaggeration in some 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.460
 Light effects has made the range of 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.470
 color look at very pale moments 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.690
 way and going into another aspect a 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.030
 both technical the soundtrack follows 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.919
 being quite memorable and pleasant to the 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.199
 heard again in singing us the 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.509
 possibility to modify it slightly 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.280
 based on the actions carried out 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.289
 looking like it can expand from 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.270
 other forms which conform to this 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.490
 version we say it with everything and the 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.349
 integration of exclusive extras such as 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.400
 hero mode that increases the 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.229
 difficulty of the game 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.970
 using special rules for 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.710
 energy regeneration or 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.360
 compatibility with my bears that gives the 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.490
 ability to share messages or 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.440
 photographs with other users being 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.720
 that developers declare that the 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.340
 main factor against previously 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.620
 was the production time not 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.479
 we fully understand why not look 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.580
 the way to add the dungeons 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.650
 additional that were discarded for 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.139
 the final project but at the end of 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.539
 day the wind blows once again in favor 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.849
 of the legend of zelda the wind waker the 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.190
 charisma of his characters the unspeakable 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.199
 magic that wraps its plot and its 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.210
 distinctive artistic stamp make it 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.009
 an unforgettable odyssey 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.199
 the touch-ups added to his 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.760
 relaunching in high definition what 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.860
 place as the way 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.860
 to live or to live it pleasantly
