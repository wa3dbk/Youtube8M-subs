00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.750
 stay those who have the whole month 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.909
 p 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.969
 Alejandro Vélez is a 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.689
 mystic the livestock sector 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.429
 youtube where you decide 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.429
 since the ccaa in the national audience only have then 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.400
 the Colombian order in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 agricultural and then not the united states in the pspv with texas in what is called 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.880
 animal science with deepening 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.470
 in real madrid eternal 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 a little bit also with what is marketing 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.550
 i meat in sinsheim and services are very small detention to the club 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.980
 that I remember so much 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.580
 three years more and that is to say that in a farm I have been of ancestors and 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.440
 cattlemen 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.470
 guillén 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.020
 and from there, taking steps 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 to arrive at what today I could say I am 22 years old 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.810
 d of most dominant quotes 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.700
 feel the national livestock sector where I can travel the country in everything 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 which refers to the aspect of beef cattle 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 already ran the ranch in economy the country 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 the canary the arc not me the country includes currently has 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.649
 represents 3 points 5 percent of the gross domestic product 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.000
 that camu represents 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.550
 to the replanting of the livestock sector 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.280
 also influences that is contributing to the 2d between million and a million and a half d 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.250
 fixed employment 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.310
 green 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.820
 and the other thing is that we can say that the vaccination wheel pallete asks around 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.310
 a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.190
 60 65% of what is the livestock sector itself of actors is believed that the 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.189
 ranches and the record of globalization processes 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109
 yes i am really happy 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.830
 a good mobile view 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.330
 very optimistic I consider that of the 130 8 million hectares already there 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.500
 currently available for Christmas 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.730
 green vaccine of the country 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.580
 we can have about 20 million of those hectares 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.820
 it can be very well exploited and dinners with better conditions of 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 efficiency and for being us producing the inmate 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.210
 d 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.110
 one million metric tons of meat per year out of a quantity of 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.079
 important milk for export 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.800
 the important thing about this is 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.859
 creating awareness that this is a chain 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.559
 that we have to advance among all from the government until now the 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.709
 final product to finish the plate in the consumer 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 as much the internal consumption as the whole of the state 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.749
 suggestions that can be made to Canadians 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.209
 he recommended to the farmers each one 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.069
 measure your strengths 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.980
 very good analysis 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.019
 although without it can improve its efficiency 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.300
 there is one thing that is basic primary and that 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.140
 us with the available forages that we have in our tropical environment 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.189
 We can be excellent meat tagliatel morel 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.799
 percent read chi 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.090
 I also think that with technology etc this exposed commented to us 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.900
 disposition of the whole world simply 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.360
 we have to believe in her 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.249
 we have to address them and fear without prejudice 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.999
 i day yet so try to 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.960
 everyone 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.229
 assertions crowned individually but in info region is by sectors 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.229
 meanwhile in tunisia as in you 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.239
 chain min 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.999
 as a cube a regional chain that identifies us with concepts processes 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.479
 the regions that are suitable for the canary rubber purpose the regions that 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.499
 are suitable for the production of intensive meat which he can devote himself 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.140
 more to rational grazing 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.540
 because her clients erasmus her because her lands allow her 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.169
 I consider that 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.559
 is simply exposing the couple to the waiter 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.559
 to use the tools that are in the middle 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.079
 people feel that the third one a forage transformer 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.629
 of beer 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.390
 that important gift that nature gives us 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.500
 and where we have solar energy the cheapest in the world and the most 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.020
 productive for what after forming or fodder in meat milk call at most 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.020
 possible urgent to lower costs 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.540
 what's the importance 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 of academics in the livestock sector 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.199
 that's why it's very important I think that 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.949
 It's an honor to talk about the chain when you talk about the chain 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.309
 huacana meat 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:23.180
 the city 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.550
 percent that one of the important links in the chain is 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.260
 previously the teaching expressly the investigation we do not comment 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.330
 more and more qualified technicians and professionals 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.139
 that they arrive 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.809
 in a very practical way to the field but look what I'm saying arrive 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.210
 really do not stay or before the halls of the laboratories is 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:48.219
 important that aspect but we want to arrive in practical peasant 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.430
 remember that 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.590
 from the inventory that we spoke now of the almost 25-year career of 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.210
 cattle there are at least 400 thousand 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.840
 camp between farmers and ranchers who have less than 50 head of cattle that 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.199
 good to get us with science with the university with the academy to that to 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.580
 the 400 thousand 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.580
 when you get to that 80% of small awards 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.520
 which are the ones that are producing a quantity of meat milk and many times 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.920
 They do not know who and in what way they vanished 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.740
 or what models are doing is not the most appropriate 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.189
 very important to link the sector 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.009
 percent 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.089
 theoretical we were and the technical and scientific sector 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.089
 in this destination this livestock guild 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.450
 the doctor alejandro vélez cádiz 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.450
 our staff and half in the world gamer ekin
