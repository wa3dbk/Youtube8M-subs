00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.580
 Polk I just wanted to imagine 4 times that such now in the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.859
 Next winter, the life that I'm with Edge is just that 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:16.379
 Barcamps introduces somehow not so much in demand, for example, something not so popular 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.179
 how do I live here? 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.630
 and Dr 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.519
 what could especially say 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.759
 for me is one of the best 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.220
 Siemens the best 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.229
 Unrest Met is in the founders child 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.229
 it's a shame because of the speaker sometimes 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 damn good though he already annoyed or 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.340
 but well what we do I suspect that one of the 1000 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 Jamendo Hans Rink Magic School Reuters Red is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.120
 Bayliss Krüsi Saturn discount round solidifies 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.070
 So I personally had to attach Mittendorf 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.630
 and 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.490
 Minden Kuska the first ass ske / afp of course also explained the same 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.740
 on the 2 skills 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.480
 the cooperation of the line 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.060
 this will close two advantages in addition 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
 So percent so much idea anyway 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 So go 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210
 stay standing 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 the titles 2 306 iSense 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 and luck level amount damage 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.850
 the important painted is the target Cu you can also MQ yourself inside 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.680
 so that the taz 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 at the beginning 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 and that he wanted to see that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 I do not think Nepal is the one you think you can 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.950
 Rage and grief at the lock against Pechstein not one 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.800
 now the fourth attack comes from her son 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.360
 small 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 no idea what that should be 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.930
 being the most important instrument of power person 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.469
 is it just Bieber just as little press son 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.500
 Round 3 is on the ground 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 as long as the kims are in there 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.330
 Annika loses 4 percent in the second 5 percent 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.999
 Growth market 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 counseling 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.249
 this is true until with pop became one of the most important to very important that we 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.829
 ever 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.309
 March 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.969
 is there playing along 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.919
 he impressed with 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.039
 this one there therefore the accounts remain open here 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.039
 and to say if the opponent underestimates 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.999
 regularly pick mom 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 So top picks per 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.419
 and then stop 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.959
 the actors can do harm 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.659
 really good my also wingers at the same time we meet to renounce the title 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.199
 Cottbus by this is Arndt 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.199
 2 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.769
 this is true 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.189
 and politics 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.059
 that is it 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.579
 new worries 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.709
 Bunce and deep 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 hopefully 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.019
 that's really good 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 how they compare to Wolf's stores 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.129
 so that was ultimately one presses Liestal 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.399
 and Klopp shows us ten times 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.029
 it originated 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 it's the last one to perform there 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.229
 is mitigated 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.379
 but what she announces in the Mainfeld 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.979
 trained there 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.979
 Ulrich alone try by 4 percent 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.539
 and you us 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.049
 that is it 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.860
 Fiat operated 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.629
 actually one of the best stairs 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.629
 Ulrich Netzer show it more precisely 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.379
 Prof Bayreuth 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.469
 Cost of success 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.409
 usually buy 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.949
 So it's about admission 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.309
 but shoes 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.430
 still wait 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.430
 Counterattack of Big Data Center NOC Nuri that Christoph Seidler 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.659
 one or two council decides 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.939
 Back to the month UltimateBet enough breaks 84 com but that goes in rounds 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.870
 Burghausen 400 euros thousand customers at least 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.620
 then would have or not 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.199
 just 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.430
 Laurentius buy Bishop Scheuerle and it is on 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.580
 out of protest 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.180
 Today are more games 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.860

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.090
 spend 25 18 of its maximum in the second 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.689
 that is 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.129
 Lioba quantities 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.129
 Motorists should our opponents to the KINGHERO 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.830
 both under Meg Ryan 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.830
 and delay something else 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.979
 Opponent was yesterday 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.699
 Glos falls 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.699
 To make deputies 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.419
 because in the medium term competition 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.710
 elderly care 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.020
 what's up 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.889
 Of course that we have the bike on the 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.169
 Neunkirchen look 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.229
 while it may be the old story pressed intraday b &amp; q that makes branches 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.189
 this applies to Dr 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.710
 Position vocally here 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.710
 consulted during Coop 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.449
 the cash register applies 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:43.789

 Furthermore, MyVideo should be under parteifreunden »on foot 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.520
