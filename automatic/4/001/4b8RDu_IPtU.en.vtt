couple series of videos to show you my

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.080 
couple series of videos to show you my
overall<00:00:47.410> diet<00:00:47.650> in<00:00:47.800> philosophy<00:00:48.040> show<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:48.910> how

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
overall diet in philosophy show you how

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090 
overall diet in philosophy show you how
I<00:00:49.120> stay<00:00:49.480> lean<00:00:49.750> year<00:00:50.020> round<00:00:50.170> while<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.530> put<00:00:50.980> on

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
I stay lean year round while I put on

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.000 
I stay lean year round while I put on
some<00:00:51.250> good<00:00:51.370> muscle<00:00:51.700> sizing<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:53.470> can<00:00:53.740> too

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
some good muscle sizing how you can too

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.830 
some good muscle sizing how you can too
and<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:55.000> think<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.210> biggest<00:00:55.360> thing<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.690> you

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
and I think the biggest thing is you

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.290 
and I think the biggest thing is you
have<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.770> understand<00:00:57.250> each<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.150> three

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
have to to understand each of the three

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.510 
have to to understand each of the three
macronutrients<00:00:58.480> so<00:00:59.080> I<00:00:59.110> say<00:00:59.520> macronutrient

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
macronutrients so I say macronutrient

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.640 
macronutrients so I say macronutrient
protein<00:01:00.820> carbs<00:01:01.060> in<00:01:01.210> fat<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.410> cars

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
protein carbs in fat so so what cars

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.230 
protein carbs in fat so so what cars
first<00:01:02.920> carbs<00:01:03.700> are<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.820> most<00:01:03.940> readily

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.240 
first carbs are the most readily

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.810 
first carbs are the most readily
available<00:01:04.510> energy<00:01:04.809> shorts<00:01:05.230> in<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.380> body<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
available energy shorts in the body and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.040 
available energy shorts in the body and
they're<00:01:07.030> not<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.330> enemy<00:01:07.360> like<00:01:07.690> most<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
they're not the enemy like most of the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.910 
they're not the enemy like most of the
media<00:01:08.170> makes<00:01:08.440> them<00:01:08.560> out<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.650> be<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> most

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
media makes them out to be the most

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.830 
media makes them out to be the most
people<00:01:09.400> make<00:01:09.490> them<00:01:09.640> out<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.790> be<00:01:09.940> there<00:01:10.750> are

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
people make them out to be there are

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.870 
people make them out to be there are
only<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.080> enemy<00:01:11.410> when<00:01:11.560> they're<00:01:11.710> taken<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:12.280> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
only the enemy when they're taken in to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.640 
only the enemy when they're taken in to
hive<00:01:13.150> quantities<00:01:13.720> for<00:01:13.840> too<00:01:14.050> long<00:01:14.229> sore<00:01:14.530> to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
hive quantities for too long sore to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.410 
hive quantities for too long sore to
consistently<00:01:15.220> but<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.000> will<00:01:16.120> happen<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.360> the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
consistently but it will happen to the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.810 
consistently but it will happen to the
carbohydrate<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.170> they<00:01:17.979> release<00:01:18.250> insulin<00:01:18.520> so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
carbohydrate is they release insulin so

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.070 
carbohydrate is they release insulin so
now<00:01:18.940> when<00:01:19.060> insulin<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.450> present<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.960> body

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
now when insulin is present in the body

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.010 
now when insulin is present in the body
it's<00:01:20.950> impossible<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:22.150> break<00:01:22.570> down<00:01:22.720> muscle

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
it's impossible to break down muscle

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's impossible to break down muscle
tissue<00:01:23.050> so<00:01:23.619> that's<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.920> really<00:01:23.950> good<00:01:24.190> thing<00:01:24.250> for

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
tissue so that's a really good thing for

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.770 
tissue so that's a really good thing for
a<00:01:24.520> lot<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.670> people<00:01:24.850> out<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.090> physique<00:01:25.360> athletes

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
a lot of people out of physique athletes

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.810 
a lot of people out of physique athletes
a<00:01:25.960> lot<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.380> bodybuilders<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.800> people<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.670> want

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
a lot of bodybuilders and people I want

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.100 
a lot of bodybuilders and people I want
to<00:01:27.880> dye<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.030> down<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.450> hold<00:01:28.660> their<00:01:28.810> muscle

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
to dye it down and hold their muscle

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.690 
to dye it down and hold their muscle
size<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:29.500> get<00:01:29.650> rid<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.830> body<00:01:30.010> fat<00:01:30.220> it's

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
size but get rid of body fat it's

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.859 
size but get rid of body fat it's
important<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> understand<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.570> because

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
important to understand that because

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.840 
important to understand that because
we're<00:01:32.140> show<00:01:32.260> concern<00:01:32.590> with<00:01:32.800> eating<00:01:33.100> large

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
we're show concern with eating large

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.950 
we're show concern with eating large
amounts<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:34.180> protein<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:34.690> don't<00:01:34.840> realize

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
amounts of protein that we don't realize

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.630 
amounts of protein that we don't realize
that<00:01:35.320> if<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:35.530> keep<00:01:36.010> a<00:01:36.160> certain<00:01:36.340> amount<00:01:36.520> of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
that if we keep a certain amount of

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.390 
that if we keep a certain amount of
carbohydrate<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.270> our<00:01:37.390> diet<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.979> won't<00:01:39.190> burn

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
carbohydrate in our diet we won't burn

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.770 
carbohydrate in our diet we won't burn
muscle<00:01:39.550> tissue<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.090> what<00:01:40.119> people<00:01:40.540> are<00:01:40.600> so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
muscle tissue so what people are so

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.290 
muscle tissue so what people are so
karma<00:01:41.140> phobic<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.280> eliminate<00:01:43.000> carbs

karma phobic that the eliminate carbs

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.060 
karma phobic that the eliminate carbs
which<00:01:43.479> that's<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.590> things<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:44.920> help

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
which that's the things can help

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.590 
which that's the things can help
especially<00:01:45.340> natural<00:01:45.880> athletes<00:01:46.210> keep<00:01:46.420> their

especially natural athletes keep their

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.210 
especially natural athletes keep their
muscle<00:01:46.899> when<00:01:47.020> they're<00:01:47.140> dying<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:48.070> what

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
muscle when they're dying that's what

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.499 
muscle when they're dying that's what
people<00:01:48.460> don't<00:01:48.550> understand<00:01:48.940> now<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
people don't understand now the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.999 
people don't understand now the
trade-off<00:01:49.929> is<00:01:49.960> an<00:01:50.170> insolence<00:01:50.560> present<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
trade-off is an insolence present the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.499 
trade-off is an insolence present the
body<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.340> body<00:01:51.460> doesn't<00:01:51.789> want<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> burn<00:01:52.240> fat

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
body the body doesn't want to burn fat

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.410 
body the body doesn't want to burn fat
so<00:01:52.929> all<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.170> enzymes<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.649> burn<00:01:53.860> body<00:01:54.100> fat

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so all the enzymes that burn body fat

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.060 
so all the enzymes that burn body fat
are<00:01:55.420> elevated<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:56.590> want<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.830> keep<00:01:56.920> those

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
are elevated and we want to keep those

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.740 
are elevated and we want to keep those
enzymes<00:01:57.250> low<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.880> order<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.119> burn<00:01:58.240> body<00:01:58.450> fat<00:01:58.570> so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
enzymes low in order to burn body fat so

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.029 
enzymes low in order to burn body fat so
we<00:01:58.810> want<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.020> turn<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.530> but<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.860> turn

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
we want to turn them on but the turn

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.350 
we want to turn them on but the turn
them<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.399> got<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.640> keep<00:02:00.729> our<00:02:00.820> insulin<00:02:01.179> love

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
them on we got to keep our insulin love

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.910 
them on we got to keep our insulin love
so<00:02:01.539> we<00:02:01.600> have<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.840> keep<00:02:01.960> our<00:02:02.080> carbohydrate<00:02:02.710> low

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
so we have to keep our carbohydrate low

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.919

your<00:02:48.520> arms<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.850> day<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.570> really<00:02:49.750> don't<00:02:49.900> need

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
60 gram of carbohydrates for energy I'm

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.360 
60 gram of carbohydrates for energy I'm
a<00:02:52.780> lot<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.260> proteins<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.860> be<00:02:53.920> converted<00:02:54.340> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
a lot of proteins in to be converted to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.190 
a lot of proteins in to be converted to
energy<00:02:54.460> too<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.090> they<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:55.900> you're<00:02:56.050> going<00:02:56.140> to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
energy too so they all you're going to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.900 
energy too so they all you're going to
need<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.440> 50<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:56.800> 60<00:02:57.070> grams<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.400> carbohydrates

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
need is 50 or 60 grams of carbohydrates

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.460 
need is 50 or 60 grams of carbohydrates
to<00:02:57.970> fuel<00:02:58.060> your<00:02:58.300> workout<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.960> help<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.230> recover

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to fuel your workout to help you recover

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.800 
to fuel your workout to help you recover
post-workout<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.970> really<00:03:01.420> not<00:03:01.630> going<00:03:01.750> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
post-workout so you really not going to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.570 
post-workout so you really not going to
need<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.080> many<00:03:02.200> carbohydrates<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.370> now<00:03:03.460> I'm

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
need that many carbohydrates but now I'm

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.490 
need that many carbohydrates but now I'm
trained<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.850> big<00:03:04.030> muscles<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.450> my<00:03:04.480> back<00:03:04.690> or<00:03:05.440> my

legs then I'll cab more car my dad I'll

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.100 
legs then I'll cab more car my dad I'll
go<00:03:08.290> 150<00:03:09.010> maybe<00:03:09.340> 200<00:03:09.700> grams<00:03:10.090> depend<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.630> where<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
go 150 maybe 200 grams depend on where I

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.230

am on my dieting of carbohydrates

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.340 
am on my dieting of carbohydrates
because<00:03:13.300> I'll<00:03:13.480> need<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.810> recover<00:03:14.170> because

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
because I'll need it to recover because

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.470 
because I'll need it to recover because
my<00:03:14.500> back<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.860> legs<00:03:14.980> are<00:03:15.190> big<00:03:15.340> musculature<00:03:15.790> or

I'm training back and doing a lot of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.570 
I'm training back and doing a lot of
cardio<00:03:19.410> I'll<00:03:20.410> need<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:21.160> also<00:03:21.340> it's

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
cardio I'll need that and also it's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.040 
cardio I'll need that and also it's
going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.760> upregulate<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.450> lot<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.660> enzymes<00:03:22.960> a

going to upregulate a lot of enzymes a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.360 
going to upregulate a lot of enzymes a
little<00:03:23.260> hormones<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.620> drop<00:03:23.950> because<00:03:24.160> we

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
little hormones that drop because we

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190 
little hormones that drop because we
overall<00:03:24.730> don't<00:03:25.300> have<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> lot<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.690> calories<00:03:25.960> in

overall don't have a lot of calories in
our<00:03:26.350> diet<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.460> that's<00:03:27.610> really<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.940> role<00:03:28.060> of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
our diet and that's really the role of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.400 
our diet and that's really the role of
carbohydrates<00:03:28.720> in<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.870> diet<00:03:28.930> is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
carbohydrates in the diet is

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.020 
carbohydrates in the diet is
carbohydrates<00:03:30.010> help<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.250> recover<00:03:30.520> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
carbohydrates help you recover and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.720 
carbohydrates help you recover and
carbohydrates<00:03:31.630> are<00:03:31.780> protein<00:03:32.770> sparing<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.280> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
carbohydrates are protein sparing so you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.830 
carbohydrates are protein sparing so you
know<00:03:33.820> need<00:03:34.000> as<00:03:34.090> much<00:03:34.180> protein<00:03:34.390> in<00:03:34.690> our<00:03:34.780> diet

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
know need as much protein in our diet

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.750 
know need as much protein in our diet
and<00:03:35.200> that's<00:03:35.710> a<00:03:35.830> problem<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.190> people<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.580> is

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
and that's a problem that people have is

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.220 
and that's a problem that people have is
they<00:03:36.910> they<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.600> lot<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.840> our<00:03:38.050> lower

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
they they have a lot of our lower

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.170 
they they have a lot of our lower
carbohydrate<00:03:38.620> diet<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.550> proteins<00:03:40.000> so

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
carbohydrate diet but the proteins so

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.390 
carbohydrate diet but the proteins so
high<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.720> allow<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.680> proteins<00:03:42.160> getting

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
high that allow that proteins getting

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.640 
high that allow that proteins getting
over<00:03:42.550> into<00:03:43.270> glucose<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.110> converted<00:03:44.560> for

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
over into glucose so converted for

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.380 
over into glucose so converted for
energy<00:03:45.010> while<00:03:45.670> carbs<00:03:46.060> are<00:03:46.210> our<00:03:46.300> most

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
energy while carbs are our most

available source of energy we have to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.820 
available source of energy we have to
put<00:03:48.730> them<00:03:49.540> around<00:03:49.690> proper<00:03:50.200> workout<00:03:50.440> times<00:03:50.650> and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
put them around proper workout times and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.110 
put them around proper workout times and
put<00:03:50.950> them<00:03:51.130> we're<00:03:51.580> going<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.760> use<00:03:51.850> them<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
put them we're going to use them the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.730 
put them we're going to use them the
most<00:03:52.300> a<00:03:52.570> lot<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.900> people<00:03:53.110> just<00:03:53.140> run<00:03:53.380> off<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
most a lot of people just run off and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.650 
most a lot of people just run off and
they<00:03:53.800> think<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.760> know<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.240> car<00:03:55.480> from

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
they think that you know the car from

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.450 
they think that you know the car from
rice<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.290> same<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.620> cars<00:03:56.830> from<00:03:56.950> o<00:03:57.070> meal<00:03:57.280> it's

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
rice the same as cars from o meal it's

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.130 
rice the same as cars from o meal it's
not<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.240> have<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.390> separate<00:03:58.690> sugar<00:03:58.960> and

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
not so you have to separate sugar and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.770 
not so you have to separate sugar and
carbohydrates<00:03:59.350> you<00:04:00.130> don't<00:04:00.310> want<00:04:00.520> sugar<00:04:00.780> but

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
carbohydrates you don't want sugar but

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.930 
carbohydrates you don't want sugar but
you<00:04:01.900> want<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.110> keep<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.530> lot<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:02.770> fibrous<00:04:03.220> carbs

you want to keep a lot of fibrous carbs

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.660 
you want to keep a lot of fibrous carbs
in<00:04:04.060> your<00:04:04.180> diet<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.470> again<00:04:05.770> adjust<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.490> based

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.480 
trying to burn body fat you want them
lower<00:04:31.720> but<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.440> don't<00:04:32.590> want<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> stay<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:33.250> long

with them that you don't have energy to
support<00:04:34.900> your<00:04:34.990> workout<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.920> that's<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.130> good

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
support your workout so that's a good

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.100 
support your workout so that's a good
place<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.790> start<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.270> good<00:04:37.660> primer<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
place to start a good primer and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.430 
place to start a good primer and
carbohydrates<00:04:39.330> because<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.780> media<00:04:40.960> has

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
carbohydrates because the media has

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.500 
carbohydrates because the media has
labelled<00:04:41.650> them<00:04:41.890> back<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:42.820> not<00:04:43.090> all<00:04:43.270> bad<00:04:43.450> and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
labelled them back it's not all bad and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.270 
labelled them back it's not all bad and
they're<00:04:43.930> not<00:04:44.020> all<00:04:44.140> bad<00:04:44.350> at<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.800> times

they're not all bad at the times

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.130 
they're not all bad at the times
provided<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.210> they're<00:04:46.540> done<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> proper

provided that they're done the proper
days<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.610> that's<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.820> good<00:04:49.150> place<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.450> start

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
look at prime more carbohydrates

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.840 
look at prime more carbohydrates
