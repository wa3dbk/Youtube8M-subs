00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 what does it have to get from the state? 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.790
 a gameplay comes here on mine 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 Channel guys want to pull in the background 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 109 seconds dna played on comeback 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.389
 yesterday I ever gave people with 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.099
 a comment something was more serious 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 where there were two different opinions 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 and there was the gameplay actually 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.980
 actually only in the background and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 That's why I wanted it again today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 do not upload it in such a way 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 bad light is thrown 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 because that was now was not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 So it's cool what it is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 was a bit more serious and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 that's why I think the gameplay is like that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 moved into the background and I think 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.270
 actually a very small gameplay 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 guys and yes, just before I say it again 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 that i definitely use my gameplays 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 Continue with reverse puzzles that mine 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 shit I have the way to two 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 also made that has the black ops though 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 everyone made that has no work 2 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 itching so I do not see one here 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 in outrageous ones the worst year before 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.430
 play and yes I do in any case 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.809
 my gameplays continue with how sausages 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.760
 Guys I could adjust to that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.680
 because he does not like me directly 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.270
 subscribe but that will be at the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 other youtuber not be different so 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 could then directly your whole box 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.240
 subscribe second point is that this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 gameplay is still not capable 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 as I said and I will 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 yes at the moment a bit saved because 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.979
 any because there are many thinking that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.439
 it would be somehow capable if you mind 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 reverse blown opponent plays and that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.250
 Ding is just guys I would like you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 ask for the people who celebrate me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 So I had the last video 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.070
 we had almost 400 easy that was too 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 ultras that you supported me there 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
 because the heel of the pike is 70 because it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 Hold different opinions admitted 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.350
 this theme and guys i would be me 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 Just look forward to 400 today 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.150
 likes there last and in the comments 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 Fiercely must describe guys because I 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.790
 do not know how it will deliver now 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 with the discs but I think I war 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.590
 so 40 to 50 displays and then it is 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 It just matters to me that I still have this 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 pay see from my subscribers 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 join in and I think it's right 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 that's always cool people so I read 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 always the comments by youngest so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.750
 just because sometimes I do not answer 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 So I almost never answer unless it is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.759
 kind of blatant commentary is like that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.170
 Yesterday or something special I left 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.729
 me every comment through and she does not 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.920
 Remember also who always comments and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 Who never comments on us will realize that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.660
 easy and yes i would wake up 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.460
 every case 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.140
 at best you what in the comments 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.270
 would write and that we parents 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.130
 times to show who is the boss here on our 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.450
 channel and her house too 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.710
 until next time ciao.de guys i 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.010

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.300
 in the evening upload at 17 o'clock guys so 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.100
 at 13 o clock 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.100
