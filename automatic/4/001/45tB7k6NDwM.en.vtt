00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.590
 present moment 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.360
 so finally that the subway 2033 as it happened but 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.469
 ground suddenly as announced 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.439
 very safe at home somewhere gone but 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.099
 considering yes the main thing is that the game is out 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.019
 and probably the most important thing you want 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.319
 say about she is not so fun mountain 

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.319
 as the release version became the second 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.210
 for someone 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 exit in subway 2033 was unexpected to anyone 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.190
 there is no refinery but the game is in boxing 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.230
 need to say 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.059
 that she really surpassed probably everything 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.220
 our expectations are like all Russian speakers 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.040
 games are often perceived as well 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.720
 probably did something good 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.910
 they can even play a control 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.820
 over 400 years they refer 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.870
 game in which 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.470
 he told Sasha really 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.340
 practically not spoiled answered 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.440
 became a terrorist attack 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220
 opinions have an interesting plot and 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.590
 the most important thing is that this is probably one of the most 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 unusual and exciting exactly 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.320
 althing players this train because 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.390
 most games of the hour 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 aims at online meat arises 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.850
 which percent there occur 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.680
 metro 2033 is a real hell story 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.369
 about the movie the movie do not know anything but prices 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:16.820
 on 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.670
 passing alone 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.690
 and get from this 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 pogroms pleasure 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.240
 But if you spent a stranger subway 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 2033 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.310
 I would like to note that the price 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 repair and was engaged by the author of the same name 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.210
 book himself Dmitri Glukhovsky and all 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.700
 events that occur mutually games 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.030
 they are fully and completely approved 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.920
 nevertheless wait for full tracings from the book 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.190
 not worth eating a lot of branch 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 and this is quite understandable because many 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.230
 things that looked adequate 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.410
 in their book it's just impossible normal 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.400
 perceive choices so don't be alarmed 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 when thirdly some deviation from 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.420
 original what other events which 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 what other characters of all 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200
 quite within 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 knows what will happen next 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.419
 earlier government press service 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
 in some cases too long 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.169
 in response to this we go to the most important thing to 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.720
 game process 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.429
 that's what the metro really is 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:23.809
 rarely affects its diversity 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.469
 the situation despite the fact that before us with 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.989
 demolition shooter this does not mean that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.329
 here from the first to the last minute we 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.739
 we will run along the corridor 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.329
 ohh thousands of enemies are shooting back 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.459
 see no perfect 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.569
 metro diversity will offer us and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.009
 quick firefight from the fact that the mission and 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.919
 trips on a trolley with shooting slaves there 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.849
 stationary turrets and just walking 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.319
 weaving tunnels in kama dialogue 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.269
 here also forgive many stations on 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.139
 which there will be no shooting where 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.549
 You can walk around the bars of the Inca pair. 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.519
 buy what you need and that's it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.929
 of the barracks will rejoice we have a completely 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:08.229
 chic script videos of course when 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.039
 get off you immediately find out where from 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.119
 what materials like the developers sneezed 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.069
 inspiration but it's not bad at all 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.069
 reference item 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.669
 6 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.099
 near 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 quarrel 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.059
 the atmosphere of the game rights of citizens 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.139
 report but surely 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.319
 still need to note such a thing is nothing all 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.749
 feared that the game would be ugly and 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.329
 so pretty dull because all the kids 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.529
 practically happening 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.249
 all sorts of tunnels catacombs and 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.359
 But underground that you can meet the metro 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.269
 and his clubs do you really want 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.019
 Edited this myth 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.299
 it turned out very beautiful tunnels 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.330
 gets why with him eats they add 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.349
 as the atmosphere and the level where 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.549
 or we see ghost systems 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.459
 very cool and going to the surface 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.629
 in the ruined city is also very 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.329
 memorable and one has to note and 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.449
 the fact that developers have a lot of attention 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.359
 paid to all sorts of small details for example 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.239
 coming to the surface of our character 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.579
 be sure to wear a gas mask and except 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.060
 how three shelf life have 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.019
 inter which is used in it 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.389
 mask and with which we look at the world she 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.110
 starts to mop up everything little by little 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.719
 the character starts to breathe very deeply 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.879
 and there for Donetsk second before as a filter 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.750
 replaced by forests of course there is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.420
 spare his account is nothing 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.130
 practically not seeing to the hero there but 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.180
 yet it all adds a lot to the atmosphere 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.750
 It is easier said the prime minister that it is the same 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.460
 very about this scientists respirators 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.550
 if we attack monsters starts us 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.090
 actively bludgeon thick clo on it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.199
 cracks 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.610
 and it looks very nice to leave her 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.499
 trifle from such trifles prince nyeef 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.530
 being built 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.139
 the whole atmosphere plays and the fact that he is here 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.730
 local currency ammunition with little 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.760
 we have the bullets that say goodbye 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.180
 and there are cartridges that charge 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.599
 armed with 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.300
 and if we have a friend all ended 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.569
 fighting we can charge you by 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.559
 money and start shooting the bridge with 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.430
 money is also very cool 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 yes at the same time 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.090
 I want to note that he is it serves exactly 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.550
 army patrol 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.099
 leaves that were handicraft 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.870
 produced in the very metro and Jan and possess 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.110
 increased complexity 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.990
 Therefore, very often we face 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.430
 such a dilemma right now it will be us 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.379
 getting into the new bridge most likely not 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.259
 call what to do actively builds otset 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.099
 show miracles of heroism to the edges of the bar 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.029
 or all the same charge 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.179
 army patrol prices find pass 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:46.649
 this place is so to speak without much effort 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.419
 I still want to say that 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.669
 metro developers 2033 took the team 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.779
 who made this trip on the elements session 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.889
 of the ratings that form the player by 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.009
 the amount of time you can 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.010
 hold a gas mask and use 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.010
 stealth 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.150
 click in steps or select on the daughter of gulls and 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.420
 look at night skating he can 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.490
 feel free to get a tablet then if around 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.220
 topics but you need to light a lighter and only 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.570
 after that you will see that on 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.260
 square is written as a result adds 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.289
 happening atmospheric and there are 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.349
 in those places where you have about the way 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.790
 blame opponents 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.790
 and you decide suddenly and remember and what about 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.830
 you will be required to do this very 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.550
 not easy because during the run to read 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.550
 tablet uncomfortable 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.360
 but I want to go home, which, unlike 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.990
 books and the game has a secret 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.620
 alternative ending but what 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.180
 ends of the book or alternative 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.659
 get totally dependent on you 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.110
 on how you will play and what paths 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.110
 do otrin want to add that 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.839
 of course the game has its drawbacks there 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:12.409
 from the glade that few bugs they are present 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.209
 that he much he scold sleep and although here 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:17.589
 I liked everything probably 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.259
 $ less claims which is itself 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.289
 advice 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:22.699
 areas migrated from 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.619
 books because 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:25.649
 as soon as you start 

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:28.339
 think about that and that's why we land 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.539
 In this he is quite a subway air poisoned by 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.969
 Under the ground, the air normally think that 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:36.800
 no filtering systems 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.629
 that's how you start over the whole 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:39.550
 this nonsense 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.740
 the essence of you right now is atmospheric 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.919
 therefore probably I can 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.419
 recommend only one not 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:47.949
 think about how the subway universe 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.510
 work here it is so there is a primitive 

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:52.869
 and columns 

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:55.869
 here will definitely like it 2 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.409
 shvets 

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:06.409
 blooms and heard 

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:08.719
 here 

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:10.319
 sweeter than the Vladimir central
