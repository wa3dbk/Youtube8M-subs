00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.210
 between 3000 and 15 institutions that are entrepreneurs to beat 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.199
 the binding of hardcover books is made with hard cardboard lined 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.999
 with cloth and in the plastic 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.529
 the binding 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 finest 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.949
 although the commercial-scale binding 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.039
 It is fully mechanized although it is possible to find skilled artisans who 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.910
 binds books a year 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 Holland 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.110
 the binding goes back to the second century egypt 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.320
 where the Christian monks cooked sheets of papyri and then put them 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 in leather-covered cardboard sewn with tyc 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.520
 at half legal mast ran handwritten parchments and binds them bread 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.170
 between wooden sheets often covered with leather but own 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.200
 opinion 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.520
 what else sun 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.760
 site 16 or the arrival of cheaper printed books with a simple 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 and cardboard binding 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 today and the commercial binding is mechanized 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.799
 the process starts with large sheets of paper 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.799
 each of which contains the pages of the book 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.120
 an operator places a pile of leaves on a machine that receives the appropriate 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.110
 fictional name tub 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.369
 your tuned ja 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.840
 came and the remaining paper is activated 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.220
 once repositioned like this to a folding machine where each sheet turns 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.520
 according to the size of the book and following the order of the pages 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.119
 as we see here in slow motion the machine starts drilling the line 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.270
 of the fold 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.330
 then 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.310
 the leaf moves with a farm until it arrives a little and on the right side 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.670
 that stop exposure 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.839
 align the drilling between two flotillas 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.659
 watch in slow motion as did the passe page sotillos inÃ©s 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.119
 involve clean 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 this process is repeated for each fold of the sheet 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.609
 the result of all those folds is what we call a subject a 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.370
 unit of pages in the correct order but still attached to each other 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.989
 The book is made up of Maria Signatures 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.490
 another machine assembles them in the correct sequence next to the box 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.409
 for binding 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.059
 there are many different methods of binding 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.059
 this is called coss made with wire 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:52.009
 as we watched in slow motion the machine will introduce fair pace through the 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
 novotel asignaturas and of the box 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.480
 the cracks are made of steel wire that is so resistant that it has to be displaced 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.639
 the book to remove them 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.639
 let's see another slow motion image of that degree 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.739
 this is another method a so-called perfect binding 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.309
 a scanner makes sure that the pages are in order then arrives 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.539
 to the houses 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.389
 in traditional bookbinding 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.509
 all these components were cooked 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.509
 in the perfect binding they stick 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.330
 to do it the machine first places the already assembled books on trays 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
 with the loin upside down 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.999
 the trays compress the pages 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.859
 then a saw that is below cuts the folds separating the 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.659
 pages from each other along the spine 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.810
 but that court creates a brothel made 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.009
 what hinders the adherence of the tail 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:02.339
 so a second saw affirmed is kasseem the wolf creating a surface 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.960
 rocky 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.289
 more receptive to the tail 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.159
 the man moves on some eurillos who apply a house to him 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.159
 hot tail 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:28.310
 finally in action two conveyor belts one with the 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:32.349
 pages of the book mounted with the wolf to which the tail has already been applied 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.110
 and the other with the book cover 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 the machine expression to the attack on the spine 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.740
 then the book travels on a farm for another 30 seconds during the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.740
 which the tail dries the entity 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.400
 at this stage of the process with any method of binding most 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.590
 of the pages of the unbound pages of the book yes there is a 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.349
 interest in clients 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.039
 Bobbin to separate them 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.719
 the book goes through a three-blade machine that cuts those that 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.719
 you did all three sides simultaneously 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.020
 the pinch is finished 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.320
 in the collector's editions are still sewn with thread 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.530
 but the normal figures today 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.090
 They are sewn to the perfect binding wire fossum 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.659
 These new methods are less expensive 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.219
 but they continue to grow and the abuses suffered
