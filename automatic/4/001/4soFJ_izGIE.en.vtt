00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
Peggy OH and that sort of pushes it on
the<00:02:14.090> string<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.049> can<00:02:15.320> do<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.680> first

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the string so you can do it at first

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.000 
the string so you can do it at first
just<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.700> feel<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.200> disrupt<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
just to feel what it is to disrupt the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.530 
just to feel what it is to disrupt the
plane<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> really<00:02:20.090> need<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.329> learn

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
plane but then you really need to learn

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.020 
plane but then you really need to learn
to<00:02:20.750> do<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.989> forming<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.920> fingers<00:02:22.730> that's

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to do it forming the fingers that's

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.580 
to do it forming the fingers that's
pretty<00:02:23.329> hard<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.810> may<00:02:23.900> take<00:02:24.079> some<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
pretty hard and it may take some of you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.660 
pretty hard and it may take some of you
a<00:02:24.620> long<00:02:24.860> time<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.910> work<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.079> first

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
a long time but work on that first

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.460 
a long time but work on that first
alright<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.239> also<00:02:29.450> try<00:02:29.870> taking<00:02:30.260> two<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
alright you can also try taking two and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.440 
alright you can also try taking two and
four

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.010 

your<00:02:34.069> control<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.030> finger<00:02:36.360> flexibility

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
your control of the finger flexibility

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.809 
your control of the finger flexibility
you<00:02:37.110> don't<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.800> four<00:02:38.310> fingers<00:02:38.489> or

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
you don't have to all four fingers or

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.180 
you don't have to all four fingers or
even<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.300> three<00:02:39.599> do<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.590> pop<00:02:40.800> two<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
even just three do it so pop two and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.350 
even just three do it so pop two and
four<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.580> air<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:43.519> use<00:02:44.519> my<00:02:44.700> pinky<00:02:45.060> when<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> do

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
four in the air I use my pinky when I do

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.339 
four in the air I use my pinky when I do
the<00:02:45.599> reading<00:02:45.959> right<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:51.170> all<00:02:52.170> right

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
the reading right there all right

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.900 
the reading right there all right
now<00:02:52.500> once<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> do<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.280> you're<00:02:53.610> ready<00:02:53.760> to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
now once you can do that you're ready to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.330 
now once you can do that you're ready to
start<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.480> string<00:02:54.720> crossing<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.410> remember

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
start the string crossing so remember

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.420 
start the string crossing so remember
this<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:57.420> must<00:02:57.660> lightly<00:02:58.530> hold<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.980> stick

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
this you must lightly hold the stick

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.869 
this you must lightly hold the stick
you<00:02:59.489> cannot<00:02:59.910> squeeze<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:00.920> otherwise<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.640> won't

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
you cannot squeeze it otherwise it won't

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.360 
you cannot squeeze it otherwise it won't
balance<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.319> hold<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> firm<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.160> just

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
balance if you hold it firm it just

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.940 
balance if you hold it firm it just
chokes<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.599> maybe<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.380> leave<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.769> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
chokes it so maybe you leave two and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.300 
chokes it so maybe you leave two and
four<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.340> air<00:03:08.549> start<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> bone<00:03:09.330> metal

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
four in the air start a bone metal

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.430 
four in the air start a bone metal
flatten<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.940> your<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.420> bow<00:03:12.720> flatten<00:03:13.349> the

flatten on your down bow flatten the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.680 
flatten on your down bow flatten the
stick<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.190> wood<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.549> right<00:03:15.000> over<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.450> hair

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
stick so the wood is right over the hair

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.190 
stick so the wood is right over the hair

balance per string and then once you can

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.610 
balance per string and then once you can

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
get one bounce per string turn your bow

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.629 
get one bounce per string turn your bow
around<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.069> catch<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.430> second<00:03:32.880> easy<00:03:37.639> the

around and catch that second easy the

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.740 
around and catch that second easy the
next<00:03:38.670> step<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.600> bring<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.139> now

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
next step is to bring it back now

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.770 
next step is to bring it back now
to<00:03:42.440> be<00:03:42.650> able<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.950> do<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:44.150> have<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.600> make

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
to be able to do that you have to make

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.700 
to be able to do that you have to make
sure<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.920> catch<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.850> second<00:03:47.270> e<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:48.680> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
sure you catch the second e with the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.780 
sure you catch the second e with the
bounce<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:51.140> don't<00:03:51.410> push<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.070> back<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
bounce and you don't push it back on the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.750 
bounce and you don't push it back on the
strength<00:03:53.090> most<00:03:53.330> students<00:03:53.690> do<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.610> they<00:03:55.610> go

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
strength most students do this they go

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.420 
strength most students do this they go
back<00:03:55.940> on<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:57.470> when<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.010> turn<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.400> ball
