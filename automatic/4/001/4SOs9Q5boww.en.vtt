00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
in this game as well this time Gomez

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.020 
in this game as well this time Gomez
hits<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.740> past<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.280> comes<00:03:37.460> back<00:03:37.640> out<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
hits the past but it comes back out to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.970 
hits the past but it comes back out to
some<00:03:38.210> random<00:03:38.390> guy<00:03:38.750> who<00:03:38.810> makes<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.410> all<00:03:39.710> and

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
some random guy who makes it to all and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.310 
some random guy who makes it to all and
then<00:03:40.970> he<00:03:41.960> scores<00:03:42.200> again<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:44.870> tell<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
then he scores again so you can tell the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.560 
then he scores again so you can tell the
defense<00:03:45.590> isn't<00:03:45.800> very<00:03:46.100> good<00:03:46.310> even<00:03:46.880> with<00:03:47.060> Felipe

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
defense isn't very good even with Felipe

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.050 
defense isn't very good even with Felipe
Santana<00:03:47.990> at<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.320> back<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.250> suppose<00:03:50.030> it's

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
Santana at the back but I suppose it's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.520 
Santana at the back but I suppose it's
partly<00:03:50.420> due<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.600> me<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.050> this<00:03:51.170> will<00:03:51.350> one<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
partly due to me and this will one of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.750 
partly due to me and this will one of
the<00:03:51.620> scruffy<00:03:51.980> scholars<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.400> ever<00:03:52.490> seen<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
the scruffy scholars have ever seen the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.490 
the scruffy scholars have ever seen the
amount<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.150> time<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.450> ball<00:03:53.630> bounced<00:03:54.020> away<00:03:54.110> and

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
amount of time the ball bounced away and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.410 
amount of time the ball bounced away and
went<00:03:54.620> back<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:54.890> him<00:03:55.040> was<00:03:55.160> ridiculous<00:03:55.700> but<00:03:55.880> we

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
went back to him was ridiculous but we

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.000 
went back to him was ridiculous but we
go<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:56.720> back<00:03:56.840> into<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.440> Gomez<00:03:57.800> who

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
go right back into it with Gomez who

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.580 
go right back into it with Gomez who
else<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.520> then<00:03:59.030> stop<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.480> off<00:03:59.690> Gomez<00:04:00.200> himself
