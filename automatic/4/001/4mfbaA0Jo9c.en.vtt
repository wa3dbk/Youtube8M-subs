00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.620
 always for winter fishing here on the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 bench we find the elastic this 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 the particular elastic the slabs o 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.090
 our true love love elastic tubular 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.670
 style use in the two smaller sizes 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 and a 82 mm mm 16 very elastic 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 very often use the service for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.410
 winter carbon fishing as 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.610
 they are very fluid in spillage 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.360
 they go out a lot so that even having to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 catch konami quite delicate and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 subtle ends allow you to save 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.020
 some more fish, the nylon that is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.120
 It often uses it to the podium winter 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.110
 also another tip that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.820
 I can give is to try to use the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.130
 valence mother and without without having to 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.860
 put the terminal to use the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.350
 row straight this way 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.600
 meanwhile one always checks better 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.060
 floating especially on fishing and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.509
 it was said before about off-shore fishing 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.429
 because the thinnest nylon will succeed 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.850
 others tone the area and one at the most 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.900
 control on the floats and also not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.900
 there are breaking points 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.380
 to recite critical issues as per 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.360
 example the nodes that in this case 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.030
 being a straight line there is a knot on the mo 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.910
 is practically the junction and on 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.160
 penalty and which can be useful can be 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.770
 made even without known is a 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:47.090
 very interesting accessory because it has 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.670
 practically in its structure 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.070
 an absolute novelty that is this branch 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.580
 you who would be is one of the series of the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.190
 law input we have practically created 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.160
 a connection device between 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.830
 the elastic and the fork through the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.260
 swivels to cancel all the twists 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.300
 and Syrians are broke 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.790
 so you went all the time 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 face to catapult yours 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.740
 maggots as reported vertically 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.370
 the sling is always ready for use 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.590
 the cesr stellino has been studied with 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.140
 this form with this material for 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.070
 to be able to concentrate and convey the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.300
 kittens in a quite area 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.790
 contained just thinks enough 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.400
 enclosed just so as not to scatter 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.090
 the larvae and also far from the point of 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 chosen physics
