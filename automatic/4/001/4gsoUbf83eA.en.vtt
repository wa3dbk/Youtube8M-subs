be exploring actually is it's tricky

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.440 
be exploring actually is it's tricky
tricky<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.590> put<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.010> specific<00:02:21.000> numbers

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
tricky to put it in specific numbers

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
tricky to put it in specific numbers
it's<00:02:21.810> more<00:02:22.050> process<00:02:22.709> more<00:02:23.280> important<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> have

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's more process more important to have

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.890 
it's more process more important to have
the<00:02:24.320> quality<00:02:25.320> instead<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.890> quantity<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the quality instead of quantity so the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.560 
the quality instead of quantity so the
world<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> enormous<00:02:29.120> i<00:02:30.680> would<00:02:31.680> say<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
world is enormous i would say on the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.970 
world is enormous i would say on the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.449 
mainland because I've different we have
like<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> group<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:36.530> islands<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.370> the

obstacles or something like that it will

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.729 
obstacles or something like that it will
take<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:47.370> 20<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.269> 25<00:02:48.810> hours<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.380> straight

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
take around 20 to 25 hours like straight

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
take around 20 to 25 hours like straight
line<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.760> add<00:02:50.910> rivers<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.450> add<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.780> at

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
line but you add rivers to add you at

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.360 
line but you add rivers to add you at
roads<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.319> you're<00:02:52.560> forced<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.220> it's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
roads that you're forced to that it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130 
roads that you're forced to that it's
going<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.550> take<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:53.819> longer<00:02:54.000> time<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
going to take a much longer time so that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.949 
going to take a much longer time so that
kind<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.890> gives<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.430> sense<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> scale

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
kind of gives you a sense of the scale

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.370 
kind of gives you a sense of the scale
but<00:02:58.320> again<00:02:59.160> it's<00:02:59.700> important<00:03:00.150> what's<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.810> there

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but again it's important what's in there

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.410 
but again it's important what's in there
when<00:03:02.070> you're<00:03:02.310> riding<00:03:02.519> rather<00:03:03.030> than<00:03:03.180> just

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
when you're riding rather than just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
when you're riding rather than just
being<00:03:03.630> anything<00:03:04.320> open<00:03:04.709> fields<00:03:05.040> everyone's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
being anything open fields everyone's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
being anything open fields everyone's
its<00:03:05.700> first<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.500> important<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.650> make<00:03:07.860> sure<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
its first is important to make sure that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.759 
its first is important to make sure that
the<00:03:08.850> players<00:03:09.120> never<00:03:09.420> bored<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.500> always<00:03:10.739> a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
about some of the environments players

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.699 
about some of the environments players
will<00:03:30.709> explore<00:03:31.069> why<00:03:31.640> playing<00:03:31.939> the<00:03:32.060> game<00:03:32.209> oh

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
will explore why playing the game oh

will explore why playing the game oh
yeah<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.890> will<00:03:33.950> be<00:03:34.010> everything<00:03:34.579> from<00:03:35.049> swamps

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
yeah it will be everything from swamps

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.910 
yeah it will be everything from swamps
to<00:03:37.030> rolling<00:03:38.030> hills<00:03:38.390> with<00:03:38.720> farmland<00:03:39.470> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
to rolling hills with farmland to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.520 
to rolling hills with farmland to
mountains<00:03:40.609> with<00:03:40.849> snow<00:03:40.879> and<00:03:41.359> valleys<00:03:42.319> would

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
mountains with snow and valleys would

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.330 
mountains with snow and valleys would
reverse<00:03:43.010> hot<00:03:43.760> steaming<00:03:44.530> water<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:46.010> through

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
reverse hot steaming water go through

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.660 
reverse hot steaming water go through
streams<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:47.060> it's<00:03:47.720> gonna<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.159> huge<00:03:49.159> rarity

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
streams so it's gonna be a huge rarity

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.129 
streams so it's gonna be a huge rarity
of<00:03:50.319> environment<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.980> nice<00:03:52.720> natural<00:03:53.720> blend

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.790 

let's<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.889> I<00:05:15.919> would<00:05:16.280> say<00:05:16.460> one<00:05:17.389> part<00:05:17.689> is<00:05:17.960> story

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
let's see I would say one part is story

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.450 
let's see I would say one part is story
to<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.669> nice<00:05:19.969> story<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.169> how<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:22.159> would

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
to have a nice story and how that would

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.700 
to have a nice story and how that would
work<00:05:22.490> with<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.060> quests<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.199> it's<00:05:24.349> not<00:05:24.439> an

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
work with the quests so it's not an

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.249 
work with the quests so it's not an
obvious<00:05:24.949> side<00:05:25.550> quest<00:05:25.939> or<00:05:26.270> main<00:05:26.569> quest<00:05:26.960> it's

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
obvious side quest or main quest it's

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.020 
obvious side quest or main quest it's
just<00:05:27.500> an<00:05:27.759> experience<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:30.169> it's<00:05:30.319> it's<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.669> pulls

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
just an experience so it's it's it pulls

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.689

the player and just less than experience
it's<00:05:34.849> not<00:05:35.030> about<00:05:35.360> like<00:05:35.800> it's<00:05:36.800> even<00:05:37.669> points<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
it's not about like it's even points the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.909 
it's not about like it's even points the
base<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.509> that<00:05:38.629> it's<00:05:38.870> just<00:05:39.020> like<00:05:39.259> it's<00:05:39.710> an
