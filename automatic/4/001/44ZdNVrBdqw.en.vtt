00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.229
 now in this video tutorial we are going to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.960
 teach how to install baby in a machine 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.420
 virtual in this case we are going to install 20 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.480
 in 1 point 2.2 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.180
 to do the following we will need 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 download a virtual machine as you can 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.650
 be virtual box you will have a page 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.980
 virtual box dot org and download of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.760
 downloads 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.020
 and the program in 20 points is a 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.730
 download section 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 there you have all the versions 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.600
 here you have all the versions of bein 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.270
 we no longer have downloaded for 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.400
 streamline the process 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.630
 the first thing is to install virtual box 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.410
 we execute 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.260
 next next if you want to create 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.890
 icons on the desktop in the access of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 start 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.280
 because the selected ones we are going to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.940
 what to solve 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.460
 installing 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.880
 well this process can take about 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 minutes 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 stay there 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380
 waiting 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 copying new files 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.550
 while installing I recommend the visit 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 of four euros dotcom one page 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.610
 in which you have adapters 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.860
 compatible with 20 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.070
 waves blacks adapters that you can 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.900
 put in monitor mode 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.570
 has free shipping to the whole world 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.310
 for orders over 15 euros and the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.510
 cost for lower orders cost of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.560
 shipping is 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.560
 with 99 euros 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.000
 is already installed 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.560
 let's finish here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 and now we are going to create 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.420
 there is a new version of joining all the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.069
 box 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.720
 if you want to download it in this case, 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.050
 we will download it to continue with the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050
 video-tutorial 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.930
 let's create a new virtual machine 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.329
 for this we go to the new 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.030
 the name of the machine because we the 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.299
 let's call 20 in this case we're going to 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.299
 give 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.090
 let's go over the envelope linux we can 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.100
 call it linux let's call it bein and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 on-line 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 Links type voucher 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 the next 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 some versions but this is fine 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.740
 next selection the amount of 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.440
 RAM memory of megabytes to be reserved 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.200
 in the virtual morning with 256 we have 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.070
 The next one was a disc 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.070
 virtual now 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.150
 file type virtual drive box 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 following 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.500
 following 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.489
 the next all and so far for 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.489
 mount the cd 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.000
 let's go to the following storage 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.920
 and here we give controller and vacuum 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.750
 we have here to mount the image 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.990
 let's go to the east cone of the cl 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.470
 select a file or virtual disk 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.060
 of cd 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.700
 we have on the desk as 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.160
 we have seen and here is 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.319
 bein and 1.2 points 2 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.439
 to accept 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.030
 and we already have mounted on linux now 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.030
 we just have to give it to start 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.600
 and the program is already running and 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.900
 we can handle it good here we get 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.900
 an advert 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.090
 it leaves me 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.330
 Clear 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:38.090
 and he's already running 21.2 point 2 on 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.090
 linux and from here on 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.280
 Well, we will act normally 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.350
 although that is to say that the internal card 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.480
 of the computer's wifi is not recognized 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.300
 directly by linux, but this is what 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.050
 we will explain in another in another video 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.990
 tutorial as with one with an adapter 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.990
 external and join 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.310
 well here is this would be the desk 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.120
 of 21.2 point two mounted on a 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.860
 virtual machine virtual box 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.949
 which I think is one of the best 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.949
 market 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.570
 and if you have any questions or comments 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.740
 I recommend subscribing to the channel and giving it 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.490
 I like it if it has helped you 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.000
 this video 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.000
 until next time
