these clouds will stay to the north of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.570 
these clouds will stay to the north of
the<00:00:07.170> Pine<00:00:07.440> Belt<00:00:07.620> as<00:00:07.799> we<00:00:08.010> head<00:00:08.220> through<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the Pine Belt as we head through the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.339 
the Pine Belt as we head through the
next<00:00:08.820> few<00:00:08.970> hours<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.780> check<00:00:09.960> out<00:00:10.139> that

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
next few hours so we can check out that

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.629 
next few hours so we can check out that
lunar<00:00:10.530> eclipse<00:00:10.800> tonight<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> winter

lunar eclipse tonight on the winter
solstice<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.420> over<00:00:12.690> 350<00:00:13.590> years<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.009> it's

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
solstice in over 350 years so it's

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.860 
solstice in over 350 years so it's
definitely<00:00:14.460> something<00:00:14.700> worth<00:00:15.210> checking<00:00:15.750> out

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870

you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.289> most<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> south<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.400> covered

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
you can see most of the south is covered

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
you can see most of the south is covered
in<00:00:18.000> those<00:00:18.240> dry<00:00:18.600> conditions<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.230> haven't<00:00:19.529> seen

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the jet stream is starting to shift

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
the jet stream is starting to shift
looking<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> current<00:00:24.930> temperatures

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289

the<00:01:11.010> top<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> us<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> continue<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the top of us is going to continue to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.000 
the top of us is going to continue to
move<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.830> head<00:01:13.979> into

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
move that way and as we head into

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
move that way and as we head into
tomorrow<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.119> some<00:01:15.299> breezy

tomorrow we will see some breezy
conditions<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.380> things<00:01:16.920> might<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> little

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
conditions and things might get a little

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
conditions and things might get a little
humid<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.270> we're<00:01:18.540> looking<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.840> mostly

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
humid out there we're looking at mostly

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
humid out there we're looking at mostly
cloudy<00:01:19.380> skies<00:01:19.799> those<00:01:20.250> wind<00:01:20.520> gusts<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:20.909> get

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
cloudy skies those wind gusts could get

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
cloudy skies those wind gusts could get
upwards<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.750> 20<00:01:22.200> miles<00:01:22.380> per<00:01:22.530> hour<00:01:22.680> for

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
upwards of 20 miles per hour for

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
upwards of 20 miles per hour for
tomorrow<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> south

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
tomorrow but they will be from the south

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
tomorrow but they will be from the south
so<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.140> warm<00:01:25.470> breezes<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.580> as

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so it will be warm breezes and then as

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
so it will be warm breezes and then as
we<00:01:26.909> start<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> head<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.570> Tuesday<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.080> cold

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
we start to head into Tuesday a cold

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
we start to head into Tuesday a cold
front<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> start<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.369> approach<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
front is going to start to approach and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
front is going to start to approach and
we're<00:01:30.210> looking<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> chance<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.110> rain<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
we're looking at the chance of rain to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230 
we're looking at the chance of rain to
come<00:01:31.680> back<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.159> around<00:01:32.490> thirty<00:01:32.790> percent

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
come back into around thirty percent

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
come back into around thirty percent
grant<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.960> most<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
grant and most of this will be in the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
grant and most of this will be in the
