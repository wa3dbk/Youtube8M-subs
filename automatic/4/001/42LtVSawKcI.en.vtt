00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello welcome from darino josico by 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.250
 gonzález thank you for being 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.470
 accompanying us this day in this video 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.250
 we're going to be talking about the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.530
 omega 3 omega 6 and omega 9 fatty acids 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.800
 the importance they have for our 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.369
 health the benefits we get and from 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.600
 what foods can we obtain 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.660
 stay here that this information then 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.660
 it's important for your health and we start 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 most people have heard 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.800
 talk about acids 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.160
 fatty omega 3 because many foods and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.440
 supplements also say contain it 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.890
 but also most people 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 they ignore the other omega fatty acids 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.650
 that are also important to our 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 Health 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.590
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.110
 are the omega 6 and 9 fatty acids 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 omega 3 and 6 we can only get them from 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.490
 the foods that we consume since the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.920
 body can not produce them instead 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.380
 the first 9 the body if you can 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.110
 produce but only when we have a 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.869
 adequate amount of omega 3 and 6 in 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.510
 our body then let's talk about the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.420
 Omega 3 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.060
 this is probably the most popular of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.430
 the three that I mentioned earlier the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.190
 omega 3 fatty acids we can 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 get fish like tuna the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.880
 salmon and also in the anchovies also 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.400
 if you have trouble consuming enough 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.220
 of these fish foods 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 as in my case for example you can 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 buy capsules of omega 3 oil 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 fish or there is also another alternative 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.260
 which are flaxseed oil capsules 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.380
 that also have omega 3 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.930
 although the omega of flaxseed oil does not 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 it is used as much as fish 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.690
 but it's also good the people who 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 they do not have enough omega 3 of their diet 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.280
 They usually have acne problems and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 never see opaque are also in greater 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.060
 risk of heart problems 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.970
 of diabetes and some types of cancer 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.520
 now let's talk about omega 6 the best 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 sources of omega 6 are nuts and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.320
 seeds especially the seeds of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.040
 sunflower are also the seeds of 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.080
 grape and vegetable oils an efficiency 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.130
 very prolonged this omega can 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.340
 increase the risk of suffering 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.500
 diabetes and skin problems 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 a problem that is present in many 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.920
 teenagers and children that this problem 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 they baptized it as a deficit disorder 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.510
 of attention with hyperactivity or 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 also known by the acronym td and h 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 can be avoided if we make sure that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.040
 enough fatty acids are consumed 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.900
 Omega 6 on a regular basis is very 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.140
 It is recommended that the same be consumed 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.940
 amount of omega 6 and omega 3 but 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.700
 recent studies have shown that the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.750
 average person consumes up to 20 times 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.360
 more omega 6 and omega 3 now let's talk about 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.430
 omega 9 the truth is not very difficult 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.069
 get adequate amounts and omega 9 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.230
 because in addition to the body what 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.410
 produces if you have optimal quantities and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.940
 Omega 3 and Omega 6 is also present 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 in different types of food that 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.489
 we consume very often by 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.140
 example the peanuts in olive oil and 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.030
 the avocados 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.010
 in fact it is rare to find any 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.650
 person who has a style deficiency 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.060
 medium what is good because this one 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.760
 helped protect us from certain 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.280
 diseases and also to reduce 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.140
 cholesterol levels for people 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.470
 that are not very convinced I'm going to 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.780
 share a list of diseases 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.580
 What can we avoid if we have 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.020
 adequate amounts of these acids 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.310
 fatty 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.760
 arthritis high blood pressure 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.710
 diabetes cardiovascular problems 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.150
 Alzheimer's deficit disorders 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.010
 attention with hyperactivity among others 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.020
 if we pay attention to the foods that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
 we are consuming and above all 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.580
 beneficial fats that we are getting 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.770
 with that diet we can improve 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.160
 considerably our health and avoid 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.480
 suffer some diseases in the future 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.820
