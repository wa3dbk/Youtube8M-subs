00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
was it easier going through your rookie
season<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.000> whole<00:01:30.600> bunch<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> other

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

rookies<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> team<00:01:31.970> no<00:01:32.970> question<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.630> think

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
rookies on the team no question I think

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.179 
rookies on the team no question I think
really<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.470> fact<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> young

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
really just fact that we have a young

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
really just fact that we have a young
team<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.610> mean<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
team I mean you know we have a lot of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.819 
team I mean you know we have a lot of
sick<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.840> had<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> second-year<00:01:37.500> guys

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
sick we had a lot of second-year guys

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
sick we had a lot of second-year guys
you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.579> Stefan<00:01:39.060> road<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> young<00:01:39.780> guys
