sure that he doesn't win the rumble it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.660 
sure that he doesn't win the rumble it's
almost<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:27.000> has<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.570> same<00:01:28.080> storyline

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
almost like he has the same storyline

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that Daniel Bryan does well I guess

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
that Daniel Bryan does well I guess
almost<00:01:31.290> everybody<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.130> exhibit<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.579> he

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
almost everybody in all exhibit of he

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
almost everybody in all exhibit of he
does<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.450> Triple<00:01:33.930> H<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.140> wants<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
make sure that Randy Orton is his

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
make sure that Randy Orton is his
champion<00:01:37.680> he<00:01:38.640> wants<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.090> sure<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> belt

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

stays<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.200> him<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.400> don't

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
stays with him I think that's I don't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
stays with him I think that's I don't
see<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> storyline<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.810> strong<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> once

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
see the storyline as strong as it once

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.870 
see the storyline as strong as it once
was<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.280> thought<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.520> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
was where I really thought that like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
was where I really thought that like
Triple<00:01:45.630> H<00:01:45.750> had<00:01:46.079> Orton<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> champion<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
Triple H had Orton as to champion but it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.800 
Triple H had Orton as to champion but it
was<00:01:47.549> mainly<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.970> he<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> champion

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
was mainly just he was the champion

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510

he bought with his own money that he had
given<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.930> Orton<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.950> still<00:01:59.250> his<00:01:59.549> car

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
them some things but the reason why he

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.170 
them some things but the reason why he
dyed<00:04:16.680> his<00:04:16.709> hair<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.370> cut<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.640> again<00:04:17.760> was<00:04:18.150> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
dyed his hair and cut it again was to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360 
dyed his hair and cut it again was to
make<00:04:18.450> sure<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.720> he<00:04:19.019> could<00:04:19.200> get<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.769> role<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
TV show in the pilot I think it was just

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.380 
TV show in the pilot I think it was just
so<00:04:23.010> he<00:04:23.130> could<00:04:23.250> show<00:04:23.520> up<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.850> call<00:04:24.030> him<00:04:24.150> diesel

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
so he could show up and call him diesel

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.210
