00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.620
 now we will make an example of chabod of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.429
 drapery in the shape of an already board ne 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.680
 we have designed one that is symmetrical e 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.830
 a skirt is slightly flared a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.430
 a little shorter so let's take the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.430
 our base 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.410
 in front and behind we go to search a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.410
 tracing the new one both 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.270
 we shortened it by 10 centimeters 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.739
 we gave them 3 cm because 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.989
 we flared it slightly on the side 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 we gave 3 on one side iii 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 on the other 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:06.680
 and then we folded them no e 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:11.130
 we then cut out we designed 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 trying to interpret the figure lo 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.560
 Slavic drawing it in the plate we have 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 pulled a straight parallel line ne 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.630
 we made another oblique up 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 to the brim we then gave a point almost 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:35.000
 correspond to this point here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.000
 we have divided into three parts 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 then it is that they gave these points here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.450
 then we split this in half 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.750
 space we managed to find these 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.380
 other points and then we pulled this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 zig Zag 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:02.600
 then we reloaded all the parts there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600
 before 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:17.570
 the second the third the fourth the fifth 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:29.720
 the sixth and seventh we have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 cut and then we joined 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.040
 so our skirt will be inter ha 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:49.280
 in front and will have a panel above that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.219
 will be taken will also have this think 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.129
 will be taken in the seam of life e 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:03:00.439
 of the side and here at this club I opened 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:05.150
 in this way 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:11.889
 here he will have a tear that will come up to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.889
 here of a centimeter stop
