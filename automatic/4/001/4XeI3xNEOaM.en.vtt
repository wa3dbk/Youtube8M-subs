00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.380
 Actually my name is Agustín Barrachina 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.850
 chances of teeny when 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.760
 you start talking you do not know how 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.320
 pronounce his name and said postilion and 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.450
 everyone knows me as you have 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 even at home they just call me later 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.380
 he only likes me and my mother when 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.550
 I've already done some trick and 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.279
 and it's going to renew everything even one 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.949
 university when I say as a person is 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.449
 a very simple person I am humble very 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.449
 friend of my friends and good 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.899
 I think I 'm nice I'd like to see 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.899
 well with everyone 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.450
 and as a footballer, well then 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.510
 they say that he took very good advantage of my 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.140
 conditions a fast player to cut 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.450
 I was not 45 years old when central 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.850
 although he has always played forward for 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.980
 the band but hey someone decided a 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 controversial central day and look here I'm 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.300
 in castalia all a pride 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.860
 well I was very comfortable and good 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 during those seven years although in seven 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 years or known five directives 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.790
 different and that you want or not because 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 a bit strange feeling though 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 Now it is true that they have changed 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.979
 quite the things and the people that have 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.460
 Lied are very house people very from 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.660
 burriana and that in all the teams does 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 is missing because the people who feel the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.740
 colors the one that works 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 and it's the one that interests me and I go through a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 real where these seven years can be 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 met a lot of people that actually 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.409
 of football to these these categories 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.970
 what the experience of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.049
 to learn is to meet people and very 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.939
 healthy and very good sportsman how 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.860
 customize this last year 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.600
 unfortunately we went down that I thought 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.270
 I think I have a better team but 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360
 many circumstances have given for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.369
 not new to keep us in third and for 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.319
 it has been a very good year for me 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 very sense with the category was the 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.569
 first time he plays in third he 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569
 been very comfortable 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.780
 plus it makes all good either three or 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 four weeks I received a call from 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.170
 someone very close to the directive of the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.910
 that I am in saying that there is 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.380
 possibility 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.770
 that sign here or interest 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.780
 castellón by itself and that therefore 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.520
 He prided good enough because if you 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 called castellón is the team 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.750
 provincial and oysters something is right 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.210
 happening something good are doing or 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.310
 maybe you can get something good and 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.380
 always have a curiosity and good 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.000
 last talks lengthen 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.740
 during those last two weeks I was 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.570
 I was in contact with several teams 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.270
 of the province both a referent as 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.730
 in third and obviously I opted 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 without thinking without hesitation for the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.420
 castellón and a couple of days ago I 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.070
 they cited to come talk to the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.450
 president and with the directors and such and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.610
 here I am at the beginning 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.700
 I thought they suffered a little more 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.700
 because I know the team if they made a 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.590
 little late powers then one here and such and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 he came to play having played because 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.709
 I have a lot of friendship with several players 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.540
 especially with swords for burriana and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.019
 we talk almost every day but about 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.019
 sports themes but very personal such 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 and he told me that good who saw it 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.769
 that there was me because I am a great follower 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.299
 Castellón has for many years 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.010
 principle there seemed to be little 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.280
 uncertainty not like I want to spend 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.010
 although it seems that he was going to continue well 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 and since I remember that the day they come to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.690
 play san fernando la burián a la 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.519
 first part of Burriana that has 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.440
 faced and he could get him so much more 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.000
 goal of such and by the seen the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.560
 second part of the players will 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.810
 embraced in genres kids are the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.310
 castellón ja pull p'alante and from there 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 until the end of the season has gone 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.660
 growing almost spectacular 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.160
 the pity that a promotion 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.750
 a brilliant season that they have done 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.170
 it has not been made up by a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.170
 lift 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.470
 sometimes 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.110
 remarkable but at least I hope it's 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.390
 like the best 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.010
 everything remarkable that has been and how well 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.690
 that they have done so encourage a little 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.240
 more season and getting promoted 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.710
 I think everyone in castellón 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.350
 pretend and the players possibly 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.000
 mind 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.310
 It's early to talk because you have to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.140
 play but I think it maintains a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.140
 template that will keep them safe 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.320
 well you have to work a lot to 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.450
 get it already been 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.400
 the best of me I think it's the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.249
 commitment when I say it's a thing 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.249
 Well I like to give 100% 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:34.090
 and I think yes of a quality then 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.620
 the job 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.380
 I consider myself a very humble person very 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.340
 hard worker and I have always said 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.620
 like to give everything in all aspects 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.630
 the worst of me maybe to the best the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.970
 response character get me the character 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.070
 but I'm my mother says I have bad 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.650
 We were left host but I have character 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.180
 but good a defect because I think that 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.270
 it is true what 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.449
 but we have a little bit of our 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.150
 character and is 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.289
 a hobby aside from football which is what 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.999
 I like the world more 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.169
 outside for him I liked for parents 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.740
 especially to beat my brother who does not 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.740
 he never won 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.580
 I liked the father a lot 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.710
 a mania before a game because I do not know 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.569
 I like it 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.770
 hug all the classmates not 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.610
 simply at hand but give them a 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.669
 hug is like 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.319
 an apex of security for all we are 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.740
 a group a pineapple is not simple fact 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.770
 forever 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.380
 an idol in football I look very much at 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.990
 players so good star the Messi 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.380
 such that they are people from another orbit but 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.569
 What I like most of all is iniesta and 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.130
 I have great respect and admiration nothing 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.390
 vidal for everything that has happened and the 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.270
 ability to overcome 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.050
 and the favorite drink food then the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.410
 paella my mother does 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.820
 she and drink well I do not know I like it very much 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.770
 a style but water 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.949
 he did not like those things with a book 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.210
 I'm not reading I like to read I'm not from 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.430
 and 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.660
 specifically kind of high now I 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.660
 I'm reading a book tells the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.050
 history of matteo when I met italy 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.229
 interesting I read because I'm pinching 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.900
 any subject not a movie and a 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.260
 series movies whatever they are from 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.000
 comedy I like a lot of rhythm 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.880
 america mpaa and this guy I think I 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.100
 I quite like a television series 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.900
 I do not like to see many exits this 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.810
 question we discard 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.759
 a music group sings in you song 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.639
 music groups, you can say a 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.969
 I like a lot 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.299
 yus our with play 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:48.360
 I love you are silence I even listen 

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:50.619
 rammstein I like all kinds of music 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.670
 song 15 the one that does not like me 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:55.680
 it's bad inside 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.040
 but silence 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.680
 for example 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.960
 they perceive two of metallica that is also 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.249
 a point that I like a lot 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.769
 a place to travel 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.929
 I like very much I'm an uncle as he says how 

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:14.820
 it is said in Valencian on the terreta and 

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:17.560
 Where is my province, my town? 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.650
 I like to travel has traveled for many 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.670
 parts of europe 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.430
 it is something that is not right 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.740
 travel a dream to fulfill so I would have 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.720
 greeted with the castle to fix already 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.340
 castellón simply tell them that the 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.190
 last year we were one step away from 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.870
 get a promotion but this year not 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.050
 you doubt that we will get it pam pam 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.050
 orellut
