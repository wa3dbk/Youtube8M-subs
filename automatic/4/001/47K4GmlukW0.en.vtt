 awesome is not a matter 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
 this is a little harder 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 but no 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:44.250
 I have not 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.340
 the overnight stays of this the consumption of 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 three others 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 those in front commented mayer 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 then when they were joined they were placed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.460
 the other two were a symbol of what maple does 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.690
 make it more difficult bidders to Italian scheungraber founded with more 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 the queues in which he has next 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.890
 i 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 and our friend Alberto 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.670
 victory from the entity a man born 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.830
 likewise a year 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.800
 you can drag one of the ideas that counts is useless 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.550

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.829
 this woke up with him outside 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.419
 act 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.419

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.579
 chuck 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:31.559
 Oct it is possible to see in the photo with him before 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:42.449
 but that was not enough to beat Monaco as nothing a greeting to all not for 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.929
 hundred 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.429
 the tool is your mother 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.759
 percent since it is 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.239
 besides modifying a little 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 so they do not break normal ties 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.229
 the truth is that I like it is pretty bad I prefer ours to ours that is a 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.139
 problem 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.890
 tel tensos efe 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.739
 I like others better, there are no dismissals with cause 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 hamels with any of the three of the second b so they look like that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.390
 it has to be something that is very justito because he feels it if that precision 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 unfortunately the nation 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.269
