00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.440
 marked and decisive design of the new urban club 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
 strengthens the image of the course range for toyota 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.900
 widens front grille with integrated aerodynamic strip the 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:18.539
 black color of the underbody components like and protection 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.900
 lower front and rear bumpers and panel moldings 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.419
 under the door they help to strengthen the crossower image of the new urban 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.230
 cruiser 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.990
 imposing to those who vote protruding join the extension of 1 t 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.110
 rear and wide and stable lower body to accentuate 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.690
 the car's broad, decided appearance 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.560
 the urban cruiser is also characterized by its high safety levels 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.390
 the structure of the passenger compartment developed on a high absorption chassis 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.620
 shock energy features standard 7 catnip safety belts with 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.220
 emergency rewinder pre-tensioners and front head restraints 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.570
 activity 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 the urban cruiser also offers a high level of active safety with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 electronic distribution of braking force 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.960
 and integrated serial braking assistance 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.380
 all forlÃ¬ 1004 models are equipped with active control 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.360
 of all-wheel drive 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.950
 this system actively controls the behavior of the vehicle by adjusting in 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.160
 continuous and automatic distribution of torque between the wheels 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.990
 front and rear 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 individual speed sensors on each wheel are combined with sensors 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.549
 yaw rate and deceleration to control the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 speed is the general behavior of the vehicle through the unit of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.970
 bse control of vs 5 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.770
 throttle position sensor and position change transmits 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 output information 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.790
 using the engine control unit 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.350
 together with a steering angle sensor this information comes 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.260
 processed by the active torque control unit in order to distribute 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.240
 optimally the torque through the electronically controlled joint 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.340
 at ignition the torque distribution is 50 50 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.549
 in normal driving conditions the torque distribution varies from 100 0 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.889
 a50 50 thus optimizing the power distribution la 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 combustion stability and efficiency

 Fcebook 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.620
 when maximum traction is needed the torque distribution can be 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.110
 fixed at 50 53 using the differential lock button this 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.920
 function is automatically turned off speeds above 40 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.169
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.859
 the active four-wheel drive control system improves the 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.010
 performance and stability in any driving condition ensuring a 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:54.399
 superior control when cornering or accelerating at the same time 3 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.529
 high active safety levels and reduced consumption
