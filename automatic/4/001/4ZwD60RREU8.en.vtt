I<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:33.989> absolutely<00:00:34.680> crazy<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:36.030> this

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
I just go absolutely crazy with this

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.700 
I just go absolutely crazy with this
thing<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.750> thing<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> iron<00:00:37.410> sights

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
thing the thing about the iron sights

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
thing the thing about the iron sights
and<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> ballista<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.879> general<00:00:39.210> is

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and really the ballista in general is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.110 
and really the ballista in general is
that<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:40.020> need<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:41.070> more

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
that you do need to be a lot more

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.369 
that you do need to be a lot more
precise<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.420> accurate<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.140> shots

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
precise and accurate with your shots

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.260 
precise and accurate with your shots
than<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> DSR<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.789> DSR<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
than with like the DSR the DSR is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
than with like the DSR the DSR is
basically<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.809> one-hit<00:00:46.289> kill<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
basically a one-hit kill you know on the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
basically a one-hit kill you know on the
pinky<00:00:47.670> toe<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> ballista<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
pinky toe but with the ballista it's a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
pinky toe but with the ballista it's a
little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.550> harder<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.059> used<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
little bit harder to get used to and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
little bit harder to get used to and
with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> iron<00:00:52.379> sights<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.890> think<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> makes<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
with the iron sights I think it makes it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
with the iron sights I think it makes it
even<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.730> challenging<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
even more challenging and that's kind of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.000 
even more challenging and that's kind of
what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
what I really like about it I like the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.939 
what I really like about it I like the
fact<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.960> one-hit<00:00:58.440> kill<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
fact that to get that one-hit kill you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
fact that to get that one-hit kill you
need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.030> target<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
need to really be on target and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
need to really be on target and
sometimes<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.559> leg<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> hit<00:01:02.699> detection

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
sometimes with leg and hit detection

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.700 
sometimes with leg and hit detection
that's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.480> always<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.019> easiest<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that's not always the easiest thing to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.000 
that's not always the easiest thing to
do<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> funny<00:01:06.540> thing<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.810> before<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.799> game

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
do the funny thing is before this game

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
do the funny thing is before this game
came<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.400> everyone<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.240> excited<00:01:09.750> about

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
came out everyone was so excited about

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
came out everyone was so excited about
the<00:01:10.439> ballistas<00:01:10.950> iron<00:01:11.189> sight<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.820> oh<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the ballistas iron sight so like oh you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
the ballistas iron sight so like oh you
know<00:01:12.540> finally<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> sniper<00:01:13.290> rifle<00:01:13.470> again<00:01:13.830> where

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
know finally a sniper rifle again where

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
know finally a sniper rifle again where
we<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.400> iron<00:01:14.580> sights<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> really

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
we can have iron sights but I really

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
we can have iron sights but I really
don't<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.259> too<00:01:16.619> many<00:01:16.740> people<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
don't see too many people using it and I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
don't see too many people using it and I
and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.799> takes

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and I really think it's because it takes

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.710 
and I really think it's because it takes
a<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.369> bit<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.610> skill<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.299> accurate

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
a little bit more skill to be accurate

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.880 
a little bit more skill to be accurate
with<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> streak<00:01:22.740> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with it I mean you see this streak I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.590 
with it I mean you see this streak I'm
going<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.150> missed<00:01:24.390> any

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
going on I don't think I missed any

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
going on I don't think I missed any
shots<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.439> did<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.909> have

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
shots and if I did I probably would have

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.160 
shots and if I did I probably would have
been<00:01:27.030> dropped<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.720> been<00:01:27.810> dead<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
been dropped I would have been dead if I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
been dropped I would have been dead if I
got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> hitmarker<00:01:28.680> anywhere<00:01:29.220> someone<00:01:29.850> would

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
got a hitmarker anywhere someone would

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
got a hitmarker anywhere someone would
have<00:01:30.180> taken<00:01:30.329> me<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> mean<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have taken me out I mean I work all the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.780 
have taken me out I mean I work all the
way<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:31.979> dog's<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
way up to my dog's just with the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
way up to my dog's just with the
ballista<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.689> any<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.229> shots<00:01:34.470> were

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
ballista and if any of those shots were

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.020 
ballista and if any of those shots were
off<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> mean<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> probably<00:01:35.579> could<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.939> been

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
off I mean I probably could have been

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
off I mean I probably could have been
dropped<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.659> easily<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.920> oh<00:01:38.040> my

accurate<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.370> you're<00:03:00.430> precise<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.389> said

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
accurate and you're precise like I said

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.809 
accurate and you're precise like I said
try<00:03:01.989> some<00:03:02.170> different<00:03:02.290> shit<00:03:02.650> stop<00:03:03.310> sticking<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
try some different shit stop sticking to

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.220 
try some different shit stop sticking to
the<00:03:03.909> same<00:03:04.090> guns<00:03:04.359> all<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.569> time<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:04.989> it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
the same guns all the time I know it's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.390 
the same guns all the time I know it's
funny<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:05.709> saying<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.340> think

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
funny that I'm saying that and I think

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.069 
funny that I'm saying that and I think
every<00:03:06.819> video<00:03:07.030> I've<00:03:07.239> posted<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:07.720> far<00:03:07.750> has<00:03:08.049> been

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
every video I've posted so far has been

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.589 
every video I've posted so far has been
with<00:03:08.409> an<00:03:08.500> msmc<00:03:09.129> but<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.970> will<00:03:10.180> start<00:03:10.450> seeing

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
with an msmc but you will start seeing

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.589 
with an msmc but you will start seeing
other<00:03:10.810> weapons<00:03:11.109> pretty<00:03:11.319> soon<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:12.579> mean<00:03:12.849> I'm

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
other weapons pretty soon and I mean I'm

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.720 
other weapons pretty soon and I mean I'm
enjoying<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.560> variety<00:03:15.129> a<00:03:15.159> little<00:03:15.459> bit<00:03:15.579> and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
enjoying the variety a little bit and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.849 
enjoying the variety a little bit and
that's<00:03:15.849> kind<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.209> tough<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.659> do<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.199> Call<00:03:17.829> of

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
that's kind of tough to do in Call of

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.710 
that's kind of tough to do in Call of
Duty<00:03:18.190> sometimes<00:03:18.579> because<00:03:18.940> most<00:03:19.209> games<00:03:19.540> have

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
Duty sometimes because most games have

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.050 
Duty sometimes because most games have
you<00:03:19.930> know<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.440> top<00:03:20.709> one<00:03:21.069> or<00:03:21.190> two<00:03:21.340> weapons<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you know the top one or two weapons and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300 
you know the top one or two weapons and
it<00:03:22.599> can<00:03:23.230> feel<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.739> don't<00:03:23.859> use<00:03:24.099> those

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
it can feel like if you don't use those

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.619 
it can feel like if you don't use those
weapons<00:03:24.489> you're<00:03:24.790> at<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:24.879> disadvantage<00:03:25.209> but

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
weapons you're at a disadvantage but

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.119 
weapons you're at a disadvantage but
that's<00:03:25.810> not<00:03:25.959> necessarily<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> case<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.859> this

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
that's not necessarily the case in this

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.520 
that's not necessarily the case in this
game<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:28.540> something<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.079> will<00:03:29.290> I

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
game and that's something that I will I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.039 
game and that's something that I will I
will<00:03:29.829> say<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.489> positive<00:03:31.030> about<00:03:31.389> black<00:03:31.599> ops<00:03:31.780> 2

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
will say is a positive about black ops 2

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.080 
will say is a positive about black ops 2
so<00:03:32.889> that's<00:03:33.040> pretty<00:03:33.220> much<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.579> just<00:03:33.849> wanted

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
so that's pretty much that I just wanted

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.360 
so that's pretty much that I just wanted
