00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.670 
off the same up to the sixth and fourth
positions<00:03:57.840> then<00:03:58.840> right<00:03:59.020> here<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.230> want<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.530> go

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
positions then right here you want to go

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.800 
positions then right here you want to go
we<00:04:00.220> want<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.430> strike<00:04:00.670> your<00:04:00.790> sixth<00:04:01.120> fret<00:04:01.300> up<00:04:01.690> to

the<00:04:01.900> 8th<00:04:02.020> three<00:04:02.320> times<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:02.860> it's<00:04:03.010> kind<00:04:03.580> of

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
the 8th three times but it's kind of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.430 
the 8th three times but it's kind of
tricky<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.480> timing<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.020> little<00:04:05.050> little

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
tricky so the timing is a little little

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.460 
tricky so the timing is a little little
off<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:10.209> want<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> slide<00:04:10.720> back<00:04:10.930> down<00:04:10.959> your

off you want to slide back down your
sixth<00:04:11.830> fret<00:04:11.920> up<00:04:12.130> strike<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.610> eighth<00:04:12.730> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
sixth fret up strike in the eighth and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.409 
sixth fret up strike in the eighth and
then<00:04:13.090> kind<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.540> little<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:14.110> little<00:04:14.380> light<00:04:14.620> bar

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
then kind of a little a little light bar

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:49.580 
then kind of a little a little light bar
then<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.510> final<00:04:16.840> run<00:04:17.049> six<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.830> eight<00:04:17.919> 10<00:04:18.340> 13

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.250 

so<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.669> kind<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.940> sustains<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.660> note<00:04:52.110> on

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
so the kind of sustains on that note on

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.020 
so the kind of sustains on that note on
the<00:04:52.350> 13th<00:04:52.770> fret<00:04:52.950> off<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.310> your<00:04:53.400> g-string<00:04:53.639> and
