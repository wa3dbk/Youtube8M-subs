layer<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> best<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> when<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
layer was the best but you know when you

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.300 
layer was the best but you know when you
get<00:00:21.840> usually<00:00:22.439> when<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.680> get<00:00:22.830> shang<00:00:23.039> xiao

products<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.900> inner<00:00:25.320> inner<00:00:26.160> layers<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
products the inner inner layers are a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
products the inner inner layers are a
little<00:00:27.180> bit<00:00:27.390> sluggish<00:00:27.840> till<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> work<00:00:28.590> them

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
little bit sluggish till you work them

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.389 
little bit sluggish till you work them
in<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.060> turn<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.599> fast<00:00:31.399> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
in and they just turn really fast so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.810 
in and they just turn really fast so
this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.870> only<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.219> seven<00:00:35.579> but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
this is not only just some my seven but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.470 
this is not only just some my seven but
the<00:00:36.120> second<00:00:36.570> cubic<00:00:37.170> sun<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.590> seven<00:00:37.980> that's

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
the second cubic sun by seven that's

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
the second cubic sun by seven that's
that's<00:00:39.480> been<00:00:39.989> ever<00:00:40.170> made<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.160> was

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that's been ever made the first one was

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's been ever made the first one was
the<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:42.300> x<00:00:42.540> cube<00:00:42.899> whatever<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> called

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the think x cube whatever it's called

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.529 
the think x cube whatever it's called
and<00:00:45.170> gnashing<00:00:46.170> Shah<00:00:46.379> has<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.160> much

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
and gnashing Shah has been pretty much

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.770 
and gnashing Shah has been pretty much
dominating<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> cubes<00:00:49.379> four<00:00:50.300> through<00:00:51.300> four

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
dominating the cubes four through four

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500 
dominating the cubes four through four
through<00:00:52.710> seven<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.579> pretty<00:00:53.910> much<00:00:54.000> because

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
through seven now pretty much because

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.410 
through seven now pretty much because
this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:55.559> better<00:00:55.770> than<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.699> v-cube

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this is a lot better than the v-cube

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.349 
this is a lot better than the v-cube
because<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.579> break<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> or

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
because I don't have to break it in or

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.860 
because I don't have to break it in or
anything<00:01:01.520> before<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> gets<00:01:02.820> great<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.750> just

that i get like that which like a piece
comes<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> place<00:01:42.829> that's<00:01:43.829> uh<00:01:44.930> sometimes

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
guess I'm not the best demonstrator at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.359 
guess I'm not the best demonstrator at
its<00:01:56.880> turning<00:01:57.329> because<00:01:58.009> because<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> don't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
its turning because because I don't

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
its turning because because I don't
really<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.820> do<00:02:00.030> seven<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.479> seven<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.960> much

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
really don't do seven by seven that much

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.340 
really don't do seven by seven that much
and<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:01.680> hands<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.350> small

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and my hands I would have say is a small

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
and my hands I would have say is a small
the<00:02:04.799> normal<00:02:05.219> size<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> cube<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> just

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the normal size but this cube is just

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.109 
the normal size but this cube is just
massive<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.740> bigger<00:02:07.979> than<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.399> pillow<00:02:08.670> 21

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
massive it's bigger than the pillow 21

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.780 
massive it's bigger than the pillow 21
and<00:02:09.390> heavier<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.640> yeah

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and heavier so yeah

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.320 
and heavier so yeah
that's<00:02:13.790> why<00:02:14.030> I'm<00:02:14.239> not<00:02:14.750> very<00:02:14.959> good<00:02:15.140> at<00:02:15.470> turning

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that's why I'm not very good at turning

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.020 
that's why I'm not very good at turning
so<00:02:17.330> um<00:02:18.160> box<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.520> came<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.910> was<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:22.030> Asian

maybes the worst or dollar cube store

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.900 
maybes the worst or dollar cube store
and<00:03:10.510> yeah<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:12.130> really<00:03:13.130> awesome<00:03:13.370> at

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and yeah really really awesome at

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.020 
and yeah really really awesome at
turning<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:14.660> like<00:03:14.900> i<00:03:15.049> said<00:03:15.080> i'm<00:03:15.470> not<00:03:15.500> i<00:03:16.030> really

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
turning but like i said i'm not i really

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.060 
turning but like i said i'm not i really
don't<00:03:17.239> do<00:03:17.420> some<00:03:17.810> by<00:03:17.989> seven<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.530> much<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:19.040> i

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
don't do some by seven that much so i

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.849 
don't do some by seven that much so i
can't<00:03:19.459> really<00:03:19.549> demonstrate<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:21.290> awesomeness

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
can't really demonstrate the awesomeness

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.009 
can't really demonstrate the awesomeness
of<00:03:22.299> its<00:03:23.299> cube<00:03:24.400> but<00:03:25.400> yeah<00:03:25.670> i<00:03:26.000> really<00:03:26.780> recommend

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
of its cube but yeah i really recommend

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.660 
of its cube but yeah i really recommend
it<00:03:27.470> i'm<00:03:27.709> pretty<00:03:28.069> sure<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:28.370> going<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.549> be

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
it i'm pretty sure it's going to be

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.699 
it i'm pretty sure it's going to be
taking<00:03:29.060> over<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.540> side<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.019> my<00:03:30.079> sevens<00:03:30.470> for

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
taking over the side of my sevens for

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.270 
taking over the side of my sevens for
now<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:32.299> cube<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.780> not<00:03:33.739> going<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.100> be

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
now and the cube is not going to be

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.240 
now and the cube is not going to be
happy<00:03:34.730> with<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.239> because<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:36.829> pretty

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
happy with this because this is pretty

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.130 
happy with this because this is pretty
much<00:03:37.370> going<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> be<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.420> best<00:03:38.630> cube<00:03:38.959> because

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
much going to be the best cube because

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.949 
much going to be the best cube because
i've<00:03:39.380> already<00:03:39.530> seen<00:03:39.799> people<00:03:40.190> with<00:03:40.780> like<00:03:41.780> this

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
i've already seen people with like this

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.289 
i've already seen people with like this
said<00:03:42.170> 20<00:03:42.530> or<00:03:42.650> 30<00:03:42.920> seconds<00:03:43.430> better<00:03:43.670> better

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
said 20 or 30 seconds better better

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.229 
said 20 or 30 seconds better better
times<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:45.019> this<00:03:45.200> cube<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.790> v-cube

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
times with this cube then the v-cube

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.390 
times with this cube then the v-cube
seven<00:03:47.750> by<00:03:47.870> seven<00:03:47.900> broken<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.980> this<00:03:49.160> is

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
seven by seven broken in and this is

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.509 
seven by seven broken in and this is
just<00:03:49.670> fresh<00:03:50.569> out<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.989> box<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.709> imagine<00:03:52.400> if

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
just fresh out of the box and imagine if

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.520 
just fresh out of the box and imagine if
you<00:03:52.670> modded<00:03:53.120> break<00:03:53.389> it<00:03:53.569> in<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.959> corner

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
you modded break it in the corner

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.120 
you modded break it in the corner
cutting<00:03:54.829> be<00:03:55.130> crazy<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.639> maybe<00:03:55.819> like<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.389> and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
cutting be crazy and maybe like this and

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.629 
cutting be crazy and maybe like this and
now<00:03:58.130> maybe<00:03:58.489> not<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.060> but<00:04:00.310> but<00:04:01.310> more

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
now maybe not like that but but more

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.660 
now maybe not like that but but more
than<00:04:01.880> like<00:04:02.680> cuts<00:04:03.680> like<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:03.889> little<00:04:04.250> bit<00:04:04.370> less

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
than like cuts like a little bit less

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.809 
than like cuts like a little bit less
than<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:04.970> kiedy<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.139> and<00:04:06.819> reverse

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
than a kiedy now like that and reverse

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.400 
than a kiedy now like that and reverse
current<00:04:08.090> corner<00:04:08.630> cutting<00:04:08.840> there<00:04:09.139> really

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
current corner cutting there really

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.670 
current corner cutting there really
isn't<00:04:09.799> any<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.819> yeah<00:04:11.600> this<00:04:12.049> is<00:04:12.109> pretty<00:04:12.440> much

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
isn't any but yeah this is pretty much

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.379 
isn't any but yeah this is pretty much
the<00:04:12.739> cube<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.160> get<00:04:13.430> now<00:04:13.579> cheaper<00:04:16.030> easier<00:04:17.030> to

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
the cube to get now cheaper easier to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.449 
the cube to get now cheaper easier to
move<00:04:17.600> out<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.289> box<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.889> I'll<00:04:18.950> breaking<00:04:19.280> in

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
move out of the box and I'll breaking in

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.089 
move out of the box and I'll breaking in
time<00:04:19.930> want<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.019> get<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.380> go<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.890> competition

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
time want to get it go to a competition

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.760 
time want to get it go to a competition
without<00:04:22.669> breaking<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.360> in<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.780> v-cube<00:04:24.260> 7

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
without breaking it in like a v-cube 7

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.410 
without breaking it in like a v-cube 7
and<00:04:25.039> pretty<00:04:26.030> much<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
and pretty much the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.900 
and pretty much the
a<00:04:26.450> that's<00:04:27.320> done<00:04:27.530> by<00:04:27.710> seven<00:04:27.920> out<00:04:28.190> there<00:04:28.400> now<00:04:28.610> I

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
a that's done by seven out there now I

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.560 
a that's done by seven out there now I
think<00:04:29.600> my<00:04:30.170> opinion<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:31.030> that's<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.540> my

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
think my opinion is that's what my

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.230 
think my opinion is that's what my
opinion<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:34.280> can<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:34.730> at<00:04:34.910> 83

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
opinion is and you can get this at 83

cube show that's where I got it thirty
thirty<00:04:37.850> dollars<00:04:38.570> i<00:04:38.720> think<00:04:39.400> 2995<00:04:40.400> i<00:04:40.520> don't<00:04:40.760> know

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
thirty dollars i think 2995 i don't know

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.030 
thirty dollars i think 2995 i don't know
something<00:04:41.060> like<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.390> i<00:04:41.570> pre-ordered<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.680> and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
something like that i pre-ordered it and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.390 
something like that i pre-ordered it and
i<00:04:43.840> pre-ordered<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.680> shipping<00:04:46.250> was

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
i pre-ordered it in the shipping was

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.450 
i pre-ordered it in the shipping was
three<00:04:47.000> days<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.600> they<00:04:48.320> upgraded<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:49.010> priority

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460
