throughout this LP and it's mostly

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.730 
throughout this LP and it's mostly
because<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:09.030> vocals<00:05:09.630> which<00:05:10.110> are<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.440> bit<00:05:10.650> of

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
because of the vocals which are a bit of

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.310
