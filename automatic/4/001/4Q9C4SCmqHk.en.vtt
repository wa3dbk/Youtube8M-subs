00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 We are on a pretty steep rock face, at an altitude of around 10-15 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.100
 The zone where we can find the intrigued house look has an area of ​​15-20 m by 50 m 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 In terms of surface area, it is not that big. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 It is a rocky zone with little vegetation, bare soil, a really unstable soil ... 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 The aim of the study is to get to know the entangled house look a little better, because we do not yet know whether this is a true species or not. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And by looking at literature, I realized that we actually don't know anything about the plant yet: we don't know if it will sow, we don't know its dynamics, we don't know if the species is declining, for example, which might be the case. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Hence the project, also because the possibility exists through the National Botanic Garden, where all the tools are available. So it seemed like a good idea. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 I count the flowers per flower frame from which I can deduce how productive the flowering season has been. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 The number flower arrangements gives a picture of the dynamics of the population and therefore also of its health. Because a good flowering season is usually a good sign. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Here we have made test surfaces where we have sown house look. There was no house look in the test areas beforehand. We sowed to see whether or not the seeds germinate. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 The first seedlings are normally somewhat pointed ... Although it is still early in the season, we do a first check. I expect to find more between November and the spring of next year. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:09.900
 There is also genetic testing in the laboratory. We really want to map all facets of this plant, the demography on the ground, but also the genetic aspect, to make a kind of identity card ... 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.900
 It helps to reinforce the scientific importance of this plant and thus to prevent its disappearance.
