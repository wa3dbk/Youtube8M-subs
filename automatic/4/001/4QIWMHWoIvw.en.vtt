with a surfboard on top as you'll see in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
with a surfboard on top as you'll see in
a<00:00:37.559> couple<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.950> seconds<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.420> towards<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a couple of seconds as I get towards the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
a couple of seconds as I get towards the
location<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.440> I'll<00:00:40.530> show<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> location<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
location now I'll show you a location on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
location now I'll show you a location on
the<00:00:41.340> map<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.450> bit<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the map this is just a little bit of a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.840 
the map this is just a little bit of a
speed-up<00:00:43.110> towards<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> obviously<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
speed-up towards it obviously this is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.270 
speed-up towards it obviously this is
very<00:00:44.879> sped<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.500> past<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> Air<00:00:47.039> Force

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
very sped up it's past the Air Force

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
very sped up it's past the Air Force
Base<00:00:47.460> underneath<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.090> bridge<00:00:48.350> underneath

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Base underneath that bridge underneath

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.150 
Base underneath that bridge underneath
the<00:00:49.590> tunnel<00:00:49.980> actually<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> over<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> bridge

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
the tunnel actually and over this bridge

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
the tunnel actually and over this bridge
and<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.539> off<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.379> left

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and so it is just here off on your left

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
and so it is just here off on your left
you<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.750> obviously<00:00:58.410> slowed

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you turn up here as I obviously slowed

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
you turn up here as I obviously slowed
down<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> clip<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.699> looks<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.210> slow<00:01:00.449> over

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
down the clip now looks really slow over

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
down the clip now looks really slow over
here<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.129> should<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> party<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> beach

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
location actually right here this little

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170

cove<00:01:15.540> by<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> beach<00:01:16.340> up<00:01:17.340> near<00:01:17.729> paleto<00:01:18.150> Bay

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
cove by the beach up near paleto Bay

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.080 
cove by the beach up near paleto Bay
area<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> guess<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> yeah<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> first<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
area I guess so yeah the first time I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
area I guess so yeah the first time I
came<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> dropped<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
came over here as I dropped down the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.690 
came over here as I dropped down the
edge<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> cliff<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.280> realized<00:01:23.580> there's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
edge of the cliff I realized there's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
edge of the cliff I realized there's
actually<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:24.060> vehicles<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
actually no vehicles so it is a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
actually no vehicles so it is a
guaranteed<00:01:25.920> spawn<00:01:26.280> location<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
guaranteed spawn location for this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
guaranteed spawn location for this
vehicle<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.009> might<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.579> first

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
vehicle but you might not get at first

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
vehicle but you might not get at first
try<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.869> drive<00:01:31.140> off

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
try so all you have to do was drive off

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
try so all you have to do was drive off
I<00:01:31.710> drove<00:01:32.250> off<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.640> there<00:01:32.880> towards<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.780> city
