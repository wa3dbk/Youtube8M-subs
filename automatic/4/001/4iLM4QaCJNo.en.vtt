00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.300
I am singing about you, darling

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.580
Do you hear me?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.440
I bring you laughter. Oh, those lips of yours...

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.180
So far away...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.220
All the time we spent holding hands

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.900
All the time we whispered, don't you understand?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.940
The fragrance of yours is still lingering on

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.860
I'll tell you, tell you why the ocean's blue

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll sing to you about my love between me and you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.740
We'll forever hold hands and walk down this pathway. Yeah-yeah-yeah

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.900
You are my everything

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.540
You enough, you're the best in me

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.480
You are my everything

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620
You're enough, and you're the best of me!
