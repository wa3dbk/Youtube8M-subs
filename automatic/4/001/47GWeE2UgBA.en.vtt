but it's also smudge able so you get

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
but it's also smudge able so you get
about<00:00:38.610> 30<00:00:38.910> seconds<00:00:39.510> after<00:00:39.930> applying<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
then it sets to be waterproof and it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.200 
then it sets to be waterproof and it
lasts<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.480> day<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:49.190> have<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.370> eyeliner<00:00:50.789> color

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.660 
tight line my eyes I really like this
eyeliner<00:02:20.680> because<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.310> little<00:02:21.550> bit

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
eyeliner because it's a little bit

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.550 
eyeliner because it's a little bit
darker<00:02:21.970> than<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.270> last<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.170> not<00:02:23.380> as

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
darker than the last one and it's not as

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.620 
darker than the last one and it's not as
shimmery<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.520> really<00:02:24.760> creates<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.420> good

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
shimmery so it really creates a good

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.210 
shimmery so it really creates a good
effect<00:02:25.960> when<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.320> combine<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> two<00:02:27.010> together
