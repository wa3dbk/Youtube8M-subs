00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 today we come to a topic that for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 most of you or for that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 Most of them really like that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.730
 going to the gym is very important and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.039
 Although the topic six pack how do I get 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.130
 a sixpack how do i get defined 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.630
 abdominal muscles what do I have to do for it 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 i see in many gyms in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.149
 which I am still many people 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 really make the mistake and think 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.300
 that she is having a sixpack exercise 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 definitely get 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.210
 then there is someone there that many 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.399
 cliche measure 40 franchise 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.969
 in a row and every day and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.590
 he wonders why he does not get it 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.410
 defined washboard belly 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 that is simply because of it 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.160
 1 the farmers muscles are actually like 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.000
 every other forms of skeletal muscle 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.130
 that they can really grow and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 that they grow best when you get them 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.549
 with about 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.229
 totally flat eight to fifteen 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.090
 repetitions are not trained 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.619
 that means we can actually with the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.759
 just make sure that for the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.229
 build muscles 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 we can not do that we can not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.979
 ensure that we now have a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.369
 increased fat burning come 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.070
 this is only possible with nutrition 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.710
 and with cardio training for example 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.869
 but not with the exercise itself 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.990
 means very important for you does not do 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.970
 too many brunches sit ups or similar 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.409
 does not train every day 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 abdominal muscles the abdominal muscles 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.130
 regenerates a bit faster than that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.990
 Most other muscles because they are also in the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 is used more often in everyday life that is 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.070
 to stabilize the spine 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.880
 we almost need them 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.590
 every move 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.020
 that's just a reason why you 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 should be regenerated anyway 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.759
 Do not use the abdominal muscles more often than 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.689
 three times a week do not train 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.920
 train for a long time 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.850
 that no longer brings it even brings 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.410
 less short intense takes you 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.680
 really on a case right time 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.090
 makes about six to eight sets for the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.590
 Musculature intensive short sentences and for 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.230
 summer or even now if you are in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.810
 winter have a bit defined belly 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.910
 you want to do that for each other too 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.920
 with nutrition with the right one 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.910
 Cardio training will do it for you 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 to make visible 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.049
 we try to build it up and that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 make it visible that defines that 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.280
 showing the sixpacks then happens 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.440
 indeed only with life yes with the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.920
 proper nutrition with the cardio 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.780
 Training but in the other video 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.390
 the first time as far as I can with 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.810
 crunches with lots of chatty sixpack 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.810
 build up 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:01.109
