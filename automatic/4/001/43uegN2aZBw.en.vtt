routes and you see that it does very
good<00:01:32.869> job<00:01:33.079> there<00:01:34.000> all<00:01:35.000> right<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:35.359> we're<00:01:35.450> gonna

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
good job there all right now we're gonna

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.940 
good job there all right now we're gonna
take<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.750> look<00:01:35.869> at<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.020> right<00:01:36.229> side<00:01:36.469> pressure

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
take a look at the right side pressure

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.130 
take a look at the right side pressure
set<00:01:37.250> up<00:01:37.369> we<00:01:38.060> like<00:01:38.359> to<00:01:38.479> do<00:01:38.600> when<00:01:38.719> we're<00:01:38.899> sending

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
set up we like to do when we're sending

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.080 
set up we like to do when we're sending
the<00:01:39.229> right<00:01:39.350> side<00:01:39.619> pressure<00:01:39.829> obviously<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the right side pressure obviously you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.760 
the right side pressure obviously you
thought<00:01:41.299> maybe<00:01:41.539> we<00:01:41.689> could<00:01:41.719> crash<00:01:42.409> our<00:01:42.590> d-line

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
thought maybe we could crash our d-line

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.910 
thought maybe we could crash our d-line
to<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:43.340> maybe<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.969> do<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.179> that<00:01:44.329> way

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
to the right maybe and do it that way

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.649 
to the right maybe and do it that way
unfortunately<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.219> formation<00:01:46.659> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
unfortunately in this formation it

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.300 
unfortunately in this formation it
doesn't<00:01:48.020> work<00:01:48.170> like<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.100> there

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
doesn't work like that as you see there

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.980 
doesn't work like that as you see there
we<00:01:49.490> tried<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.789> do<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.420> does<00:01:50.600> not<00:01:50.750> work

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
we tried to do that and it does not work

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.260 
we tried to do that and it does not work
it's<00:01:51.950> not<00:01:52.070> effective<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.609> I<00:01:52.640> i<00:01:52.670> I've<00:01:53.030> been

I should<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.590> fit<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.739> lend<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> left<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.579> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
I should be fit to lend a left is it's a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.009 
I should be fit to lend a left is it's a
generic<00:02:27.000> setup<00:02:27.329> for<00:02:27.450> everything<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:27.989> from

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
generic setup for everything we do from

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.720 
generic setup for everything we do from
this<00:02:28.260> elimination<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.430> here<00:02:29.579> we're<00:02:29.700> just

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
this elimination so here we're just

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.339 
this elimination so here we're just
going<00:02:29.969> to<00:02:30.000> run<00:02:30.269> out<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.599> right<00:02:30.810> side<00:02:31.019> flats

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
going to run out to the right side flats

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.720 
going to run out to the right side flats
and<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.099> are<00:02:32.159> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> get<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.519> right

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
and you see are going to get the right

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.270 
and you see are going to get the right
edge<00:02:32.939> pressure<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.769> we're<00:02:34.890> quick<00:02:35.010> let's<00:02:35.189> take

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
edge pressure so we're quick let's take

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
edge pressure so we're quick let's take
a<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.609> is<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.939> replay<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.629> what

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a look at that is to replay and see what

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.470 
a look at that is to replay and see what
we<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.459> place<00:02:38.640> looks<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.000> from<00:02:39.359> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
we see that this place looks like from a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030 
we see that this place looks like from a
quarterback<00:02:39.810> standpoint<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
quarterback standpoint so the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.500 
quarterback standpoint so the
quarterback<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.879> see<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.420> you're

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
quarterback is going to see that you're

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.580 
quarterback is going to see that you're
going<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.689> send<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:43.079> edge<00:02:43.230> pressure

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
going to send that right edge pressure

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.470 
going to send that right edge pressure
cool<00:02:44.220> part<00:02:44.459> about<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.299> going<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
cool part about this is it's going to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.880 
cool part about this is it's going to

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
moment here but you see get that right

moment here but you see get that right
and<00:03:53.970> left<00:03:54.299> side<00:03:54.510> pressure<00:03:54.780> after<00:03:55.019> quarterback

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
and left side pressure after quarterback

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.229 
and left side pressure after quarterback
at<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.889> point<00:03:56.190> actually<00:03:56.760> made<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:56.909> mistake

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
at this point actually made a mistake

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.670 
at this point actually made a mistake
with<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.479> user<00:03:57.659> control<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.229> snap<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.560> ball

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
with the user control the snap the ball

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.899 
with the user control the snap the ball
would<00:03:58.799> float<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.220> little<00:03:59.370> bit<00:03:59.489> too<00:03:59.669> quick

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
would float out a little bit too quick

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.610 
would float out a little bit too quick
you<00:04:00.299> need<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.510> hold<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.139> like<00:04:01.440> maybe

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
you need to hold just for like maybe

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.259 
you need to hold just for like maybe
just<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.919> split<00:04:02.250> second<00:04:02.729> then<00:04:02.909> you<00:04:02.970> could<00:04:03.090> drop

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
just a split second then you could drop

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.420 
just a split second then you could drop
out<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:03.720> here<00:04:04.229> you<00:04:04.349> see<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.769> pressure<00:04:05.310> is

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
out but here you see the pressure is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.979 
out but here you see the pressure is
pretty<00:04:05.609> good<00:04:05.849> at<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.209> quarterback<00:04:06.510> now<00:04:06.840> let's

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
pretty good at the quarterback now let's

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.479 
pretty good at the quarterback now let's
take<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.139> look<00:04:07.290> at<00:04:07.349> what<00:04:07.409> they<00:04:07.739> have<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.919> blockade

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489

left<00:04:35.250> eye<00:04:35.400> still<00:04:35.639> really<00:04:35.969> and<00:04:36.210> wherever<00:04:36.450> you

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
left eye still really and wherever you

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.380 
left eye still really and wherever you
go

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
go

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.390 
go
well<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.750> mean<00:04:38.140> maybe<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.620> corner<00:04:38.920> out<00:04:39.100> but

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
well I mean maybe that corner out but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.950 
well I mean maybe that corner out but
it's<00:04:39.790> still<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.270> be<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.390> dicey<00:04:40.570> throw<00:04:40.900> out

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
it's still going to be a dicey throw out

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.390 
it's still going to be a dicey throw out
with<00:04:41.050> me<00:04:41.200> user<00:04:41.410> controlling<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:41.980> sometimes

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
with me user controlling that sometimes

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.860 
with me user controlling that sometimes
and<00:04:42.610> sometimes<00:04:42.730> not<00:04:43.150> going<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.750> be<00:04:43.810> very

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
and sometimes not going to be very

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.660 
and sometimes not going to be very
difficult<00:04:44.170> and<00:04:44.590> then<00:04:44.830> lots<00:04:45.070> of<00:04:45.220> guys<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.490> do<00:04:45.550> you

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
difficult and then lots of guys I do you

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.800 
difficult and then lots of guys I do you
want<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.850> show<00:04:46.000> this<00:04:46.090> against<00:04:46.360> play<00:04:46.570> action

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
want to show this against play action

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.260 
want to show this against play action
blocking<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.010> what<00:04:48.190> legend<00:04:48.790> blockings<00:04:49.150> will

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
blocking so what legend blockings will

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.520 
blocking so what legend blockings will
most<00:04:49.480> effective<00:04:49.870> things<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.170> they<00:04:50.230> can<00:04:50.260> do

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
most effective things that they can do

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.170 
most effective things that they can do
so<00:04:51.010> they're<00:04:51.130> going<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.310> block<00:04:51.520> play<00:04:51.730> action<00:04:51.910> in

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
so they're going to block play action in

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.920 
so they're going to block play action in
they're<00:04:52.300> gonna<00:04:52.390> block<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.720> running<00:04:52.870> back

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
they're gonna block and running back

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.570 
they're gonna block and running back
this<00:04:53.110> for<00:04:53.290> surely<00:04:53.590> will<00:04:53.740> stop<00:04:54.010> any<00:04:54.310> pressure

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
this for surely will stop any pressure

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.010 
this for surely will stop any pressure
you'll<00:04:54.790> set<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.180> season<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.690> lot<00:04:55.900> of

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
you'll set in this season a lot of

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.480 
you'll set in this season a lot of
people<00:04:56.110> think<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.860> we're<00:04:57.340> going<00:04:57.460> to

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
people think that and we're going to

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.280 
people think that and we're going to
prove<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.730> wrong<00:04:57.880> right<00:04:58.120> here<00:04:58.390> or<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:58.990> set

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
prove you wrong right here or have set

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.350 
prove you wrong right here or have set
the<00:04:59.440> same<00:04:59.710> double<00:05:00.040> side<00:05:00.190> pressure<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.820> here

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
the same double side pressure and here

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.210 
the same double side pressure and here
you're<00:05:01.450> going<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.600> see<00:05:01.830> left<00:05:02.830> side<00:05:03.010> pressure

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
you're going to see left side pressure

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.460 
you're going to see left side pressure
still<00:05:03.520> comes<00:05:03.760> in<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.840> is<00:05:04.990> very<00:05:05.260> critical

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
still comes in so that is very critical

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.530 
still comes in so that is very critical
with<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.040> defense<00:05:06.490> it's<00:05:07.150> one<00:05:07.300> of<00:05:07.390> main

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
with this defense it's one of main

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.850 
with this defense it's one of main

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
reasons I like that so much a lot of

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.140 
reasons I like that so much a lot of
people<00:05:09.040> think<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.250> play<00:05:09.460> action<00:05:09.610> walking<00:05:10.000> is

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
people think that play action walking is

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.640 
people think that play action walking is
really<00:05:10.750> effective<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.200> it<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.410> very

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650
