00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.470

 pointed out the trendy tricologist tanquinhos year will continue 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.090
 certainly both in winter and in summer this can use 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 it's 3d 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.890
 any attitude 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.280
 knitting machines we sell 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.930
 in the two seasons and we do not only have art of the heavy ones we have 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.840
 lightweight salon articles with the up to adult male baby and 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.660
 and so on 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.990
 He has a verse that says 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.570
 a woman of inspections even higher than the value of pearls and precious stones 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 this shows how much the woman's beauty is more interior exterior 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:22.709
 with that philosophy of life that victory is that in such of campinas are paulo 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.419
 came to his home to teach the typical course 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.279
 which is almost sideways because it is handmade I received a special touch 'and 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.259
 these year's staff 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:39.169
 pieces made with affection and creativity as caché which cearense ball and goose 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.109
 note escalation 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.849
 do the course will become even more interesting the lateral ran out 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.039
 the action to ride with years 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:53.179
 but it is a job that I sought is because I would like many have to go through 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:58.579
 for other people not only tricolou but through knitting a 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.849
 message 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.580
 that we can do the target, we can not keep that one for us 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580
 we need to share with other people 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.989
 often have people who know how to do many things 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.990
 and they will pass to themselves are wrong 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.719
 so I knew my work for the greater purpose 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.779
 but no one was hurt who also I am still trembling but teaching of 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:25.710
 truth 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.670
 already when we shared something that we know with other people 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.449
 actually 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.959
 we are multiplying 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.589
 and we can not never agree with all our fans 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.219
 this in my wisdom 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.010
 we have to move forward because we use eternal all day 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.619
 we will die 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:53.699
 and how come you pass through this land learn how to do so many things 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.729
 beautiful and then dies that take with you 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.029
 so what you know 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.019
 I passed on to other people 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.469
 This is mine 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:08.809
 My biggest lesson is that luck turns to joaçaba. For me, it's already a gift. 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:11.819
 merkel considers this as a gift 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.359
 and they are so are fans 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.810
 socks were also anxious 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.459
 for me to know 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.300
 So we go to a city that knows you already have an audience. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.620
 there what is faithful and that you will be able to see them personally give a battle 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.740
 say a word friend look at the expectation is too big i can 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.979
 tell you 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.639
 gives joy that I feel inside of me to be here 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.360
 age also missing we are a little bit of what you brought yes yes 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.999
 what kind of work to differentiate if you bring it to show them 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.259
 It's because it existed up to five years ago. 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.119
 it was a tricky stretch to be made slow action pieces of people 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:02.330
 they stayed there sometimes for up to a month making a couple 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.379
 I have an all my style. 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.840
 I only do pies what you do in the morning to use at night are pieces 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.240
 so extremely fast 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.270
 pieces that you take into consideration 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.389
 very little hard 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.439
 novel you can make an accessory 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.899
 It is a reality that the easiest accessories are scarf at this time which 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:27.099
 want 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.490
 it's to blame 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.330
 the core is all you need to play in the neck, right? 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.910
 fashion these accessories and neck any little thing you put 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.669
 You're already extremely charming. 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.839
 and I worry a lot about the people who sell it out 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.009
 so I want to 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.900
 I know a little stuff 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.279
 she can sell for a better price 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.000
 but they can also do it there in a single day of the 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.430
 the three dams 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.150
 so they are really very fast parts. 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.999
 victory then so after going through this measure for us 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.289
 start as soon as the people who 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.020
 some find it difficult to do something both in the area of 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.620
 telecommunication anatel 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.879
 as in others, separate the 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.719
 What I have to say to you is so first bush that god in your 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.839
 life 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.849
 because it is our source of inspiration 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.369
 it is he who gives us wisdom patience 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.419
 and it is he who gives us the idea 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.229
 if you have a dream 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.229
 cases are year do not let that dream die 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.760
 never tell you if you're not able because it's not true everyone 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.099
 we when we are born 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.999
 we are all born with a very large capacity already 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.439
 walk within us 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.579
 and we do not always test this ability 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.669
 So prove to yourself and what you're capable of. 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.439
 I myself am an example 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.909
 I never did stayed in my life. 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.919
 and I decided to learn how to do and then on the television 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.399
 today I make five television channels 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:17.759
 Today I travel all over Brazil, from Manaus to Portalegre every day. 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:23.199
 teaching a little of what I know why because I believed in myself 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.919
 I believed in God a lot 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.490
 and I believed in what I am capable of then why can I tell you 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:34.129
 go ahead because you are able
