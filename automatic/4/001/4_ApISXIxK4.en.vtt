one<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.369> second<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.740> third<00:02:07.770> one

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:10.609 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.690 

back<00:02:11.609> to<00:02:11.790> back<00:02:11.999> to<00:02:12.689> back<00:02:12.980> now<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.189> does<00:02:14.400> look

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
back to back to back now it does look

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640 
back to back to back now it does look
like<00:02:14.730> these<00:02:15.209> are<00:02:15.269> not<00:02:15.780> blu<00:02:16.260> ray/dvd<00:02:16.499> combo

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
like these are not blu ray/dvd combo

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.459 
like these are not blu ray/dvd combo
packs<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.939> guess<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.139> bought<00:02:19.319> them

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
packs I guess if you bought them

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.289 
packs I guess if you bought them
individually<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:20.400> were<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.579> combo<00:02:20.909> packs<00:02:21.150> but

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
individually they were a combo packs but

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.330 
individually they were a combo packs but
I<00:02:21.359> guess<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> trilogy<00:02:22.379> said<00:02:22.620> they're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I guess what the trilogy said they're

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.399 
I guess what the trilogy said they're
just<00:02:23.670> regular<00:02:23.969> blu-ray<00:02:24.389> so<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.139> want<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
just regular blu-ray so if you want the

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.800 
just regular blu-ray so if you want the
films<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.739> DVD<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.370> well<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.299> you're<00:02:27.629> probably

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
films on DVD as well you you're probably

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
films on DVD as well you you're probably
gonna<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.319> keep<00:02:28.530> your<00:02:28.739> own<00:02:28.889> for<00:02:29.250> this

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
gonna have to keep your own for this

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.129 
gonna have to keep your own for this
specific<00:02:29.939> set<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.569> you're<00:02:30.689> just<00:02:30.870> wanting

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
specific set but if you're just wanting

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.259 
specific set but if you're just wanting
them<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.469> blu-ray<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:32.129> guess<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.879> is<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> way

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
them on blu-ray I guess this is the way

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.640 
them on blu-ray I guess this is the way
to<00:02:33.329> go<00:02:33.540> alright<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.109> I<00:02:34.139> went<00:02:34.349> ahead<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.590> took

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
and your one disc i guess if it was a

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.219 
and your one disc i guess if it was a
comic<00:03:18.000> patcher<00:03:18.209> -<00:03:18.359> probably<00:03:18.540> at<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.959> right

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
comic patcher - probably at this right

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.830 
comic patcher - probably at this right
here<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.949> uh<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.790> know<00:03:20.939> it's<00:03:21.329> it's<00:03:21.599> fine

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
here but uh you know it's it's fine

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.170 
here but uh you know it's it's fine
considering<00:03:22.229> the<00:03:22.470> price<00:03:22.650> i<00:03:22.829> paid<00:03:23.040> not<00:03:23.729> too<00:03:23.939> bad

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
considering the price i paid not too bad

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.929 
considering the price i paid not too bad
I<00:03:24.209> guess<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.019> again<00:03:25.229> the<00:03:25.409> inside<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.189> the<00:03:26.759> case

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
I guess so again the inside of the case

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.610 
I guess so again the inside of the case
no<00:03:27.180> background<00:03:27.419> artwork<00:03:27.900> anything<00:03:28.319> pretty

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
no background artwork anything pretty

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.469 
no background artwork anything pretty
plain<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.790> Santa<00:03:29.970> Claus<00:03:30.180> one

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
plain so that's the Santa Claus one

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.780 
plain so that's the Santa Claus one
Santa<00:03:31.019> Claus<00:03:31.259> -<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.919> this<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.370> 10th

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
Santa Claus - and this is the 10th

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.569 
Santa Claus - and this is the 10th
anniversary<00:03:33.379> release<00:03:34.379> of<00:03:34.799> Santa<00:03:35.189> Claus<00:03:35.340> -

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
anniversary release of Santa Claus -

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.339 
anniversary release of Santa Claus -
which<00:03:35.759> is<00:03:35.909> pretty<00:03:36.150> shocking<00:03:36.269> because<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.959> still

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
which is pretty shocking because I still

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.289 
which is pretty shocking because I still
vividly<00:03:37.769> remember<00:03:38.040> seeing<00:03:38.699> this<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:38.970> theaters

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
vividly remember seeing this in theaters

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.439 
vividly remember seeing this in theaters
so<00:03:39.599> it's<00:03:40.290> weird<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.769> think<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.159> this<00:03:42.120> films

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
so it's weird to think that this films

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.849 
so it's weird to think that this films

why<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.680> guess<00:04:46.889> this<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.220> probably<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:48.960> kind

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
why I guess this is probably just kind

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.770 
why I guess this is probably just kind
of<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.830> repackage<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.000> first<00:04:51.270> release<00:04:51.600> of

this set is going for $34 on Amazon

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.340 
this set is going for $34 on Amazon
which<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.630> actually<00:05:48.930> pretty<00:05:49.080> good

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
which is actually pretty good

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.560 
which is actually pretty good
considering<00:05:49.710> most<00:05:50.610> places<00:05:50.880> have<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.390> going

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
considering most places have it going

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.460 
considering most places have it going
for<00:05:51.750> about<00:05:51.840> 45<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:53.310> 55<00:05:53.789> 60<00:05:54.180> bucks<00:05:54.419> online<00:05:55.020> and

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
for about 45 to 55 60 bucks online and

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.370 
for about 45 to 55 60 bucks online and
most<00:05:56.460> stores<00:05:56.700> don't<00:05:56.970> even<00:05:57.180> carry<00:05:57.450> these<00:05:57.990> films

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
most stores don't even carry these films

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.380 
most stores don't even carry these films
at<00:05:58.530> all<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:58.950> looked<00:05:59.460> at<00:05:59.580> Best<00:05:59.789> Buy<00:05:59.880> they<00:06:00.150> didn't

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
at all I looked at Best Buy they didn't

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.180 
at all I looked at Best Buy they didn't
even<00:06:00.450> have<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.229> Amazon<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.770> probably<00:06:02.070> your

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
even have it so Amazon is probably your

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.350 
even have it so Amazon is probably your
safest<00:06:02.610> bet
