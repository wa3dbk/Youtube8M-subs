one up top that one looks great its
first<00:01:09.780> stage<00:01:09.990> evolution<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.799> second

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
first stage evolution and the second

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.960 
first stage evolution and the second
stage<00:01:11.850> evolution<00:01:12.270> final<00:01:12.479> evolution<00:01:12.780> looks

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
stage evolution final evolution looks

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.600 
stage evolution final evolution looks
outstanding<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> looks<00:01:15.750> great<00:01:16.140> I

mean<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.330> tree<00:01:18.540> might<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
mean I think the tree might be a little

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.539 
mean I think the tree might be a little
too<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.560> maybe<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> little

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
too much like maybe make a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
too much like maybe make a little
smaller<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.240> think<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.479> looks<00:01:21.630> great<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
smaller but I think it looks great I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.980 
smaller but I think it looks great I
kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.729> tropical<00:01:23.729> theme<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.780> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to me um I don't really dig the colors

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
to me um I don't really dig the colors
on<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.180> tail<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.720> ears<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.110> too

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
on it and the tail and the ears are too

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.330 
on it and the tail and the ears are too
much<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:55.890> eyes<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.310> looks

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
much in my eyes and but this one looks

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.260 
much in my eyes and but this one looks
great<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.540> fennekin<00:02:00.869> uh<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:02.149> can<00:02:03.149> definitely

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
great for fennekin uh I can definitely

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.100 
great for fennekin uh I can definitely
see<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> was

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
see this and I would like it if it was

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.540 
see this and I would like it if it was
like<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.270> now<00:02:09.270> onto<00:02:09.450> froakie<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:11.310> looks

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
like that now onto froakie that looks

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.350 
like that now onto froakie that looks
really<00:02:11.670> good

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
really good

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.060 
really good
I<00:02:13.450> would<00:02:13.960> really<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.470> feels<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
I would really like it feels like that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.580 
I would really like it feels like that
it<00:02:15.310> looks<00:02:15.490> like<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.760> could<00:02:15.940> be<00:02:15.970> water<00:02:16.590> fighting

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it looks like it could be water fighting

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.800 
it looks like it could be water fighting
which<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.370> I'm<00:02:18.460> hoping<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.730> also<00:02:19.210> so

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
which is what I'm hoping for also so

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.240 
which is what I'm hoping for also so
that<00:02:19.840> looks<00:02:20.110> great<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:22.090> here's<00:02:22.360> just<00:02:22.660> some

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.190 
that looks great and here's just some
random<00:02:24.250> six-string<00:02:24.910> Pokemon<00:02:25.360> nothing<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.110> do

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
random six-string Pokemon nothing to do

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.630 
random six-string Pokemon nothing to do
with<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> starters<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.520> definitely

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
with the starters so I can definitely

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.600 
with the starters so I can definitely
see<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:27.940> bloob<00:02:28.240> go<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.720> being<00:02:29.080> one<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.580> I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
see the bloob go for being one but I

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.300 
see the bloob go for being one but I
can't<00:02:30.910> see<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.470> cat<00:02:32.740> one<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.190> bottom

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
can't see the the cat one at the bottom

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.010 
can't see the the cat one at the bottom
people<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:33.850> looks<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.240> little<00:02:34.720> too

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
people it just looks a little too

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.410 
people it just looks a little too
cartoonish<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:36.520> on<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> blue<00:02:36.910> go<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.270> what<00:02:37.390> I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
cartoonish but on the blue go for what I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.720 
cartoonish but on the blue go for what I
really<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.050> um<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.800> noticed<00:02:39.520> this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
really like that um I just noticed this

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.460 
really like that um I just noticed this
if<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.180> could<00:02:40.300> look<00:02:40.540> at<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> battle<00:02:41.200> scene

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
if you could look at the battle scene

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.620 
if you could look at the battle scene
right<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.150> see<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.510> at

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
right there you can see it's at

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.390 
right there you can see it's at
nighttime<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.800> looks<00:02:45.010> really<00:02:45.160> good

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
nighttime and that looks really good

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
nighttime and that looks really good
actually<00:02:45.670> though<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.570> how<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.840> moons<00:02:47.110> are

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
actually though like how the moons are

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.690 
actually though like how the moons are
so<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.830> hope<00:02:47.920> they<00:02:48.070> actually<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:48.490> something

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
so I hope they actually do something

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600 
so I hope they actually do something
like<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.270> game<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.520> these
