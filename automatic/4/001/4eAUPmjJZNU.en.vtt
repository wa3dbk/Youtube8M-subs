a lap of the algarve circuit in the size
of<00:00:23.019> Portugal<00:00:23.500> we're<00:00:24.220> here<00:00:24.369> for<00:00:24.489> the<00:00:24.609> thousand

good driving in the darkness Here I am

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.259 
good driving in the darkness Here I am
in<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.930> car<00:00:35.110> I'm<00:00:35.470> just<00:00:35.710> leaving<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.309> pics<00:00:36.519> we

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
in the car I'm just leaving the pics we

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.139 
in the car I'm just leaving the pics we
start<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.570> first<00:00:37.809> corner<00:00:38.110> here<00:00:38.790> fast<00:00:39.790> corner

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
start the first corner here fast corner

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.030 
start the first corner here fast corner
third<00:00:40.390> gear<00:00:40.659> through<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.290> fourth<00:00:41.559> gear<00:00:41.739> King

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
third gear through the fourth gear King

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.920 
third gear through the fourth gear King
and<00:00:42.250> into<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.519> second<00:00:42.970> gear<00:00:43.149> tight<00:00:43.449> right

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
and into a second gear tight right

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.340 
and into a second gear tight right
hairpin<00:00:45.239> quite<00:00:46.239> probably<00:00:46.930> one<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.199> the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
hairpin quite probably one of the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.840 
hairpin quite probably one of the
slowest<00:00:47.769> parts<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.220> circuit<00:00:48.579> then<00:00:48.729> we

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
slowest parts to the circuit then we

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.270 
slowest parts to the circuit then we
have<00:00:49.150> an<00:00:49.299> uphill<00:00:49.449> climb<00:00:49.900> here<00:00:50.559> it's<00:00:51.100> quite

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
have an uphill climb here it's quite

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.829 
have an uphill climb here it's quite
blind<00:00:51.580> with<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.909> car<00:00:52.119> so<00:00:52.360> if<00:00:52.449> you<00:00:52.570> know<00:00:52.689> where

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
blind with the car so if you know where

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.600 
blind with the car so if you know where
you're<00:00:52.960> going<00:00:52.989> you're<00:00:53.320> okay<00:00:53.650> but<00:00:53.890> it's<00:00:54.369> quite

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
you're going you're okay but it's quite

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.219 
you're going you're okay but it's quite
often<00:00:54.790> you<00:00:54.970> fall<00:00:55.269> off<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.869> edge<00:00:55.989> of<00:00:56.110> the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
often you fall off this the edge of the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.850 
often you fall off this the edge of the
track<00:00:56.439> there<00:00:57.540> yeah<00:00:58.540> then<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:59.290> have<00:00:59.409> this<00:00:59.559> this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
track there yeah then we have this this

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.670 
track there yeah then we have this this
short<00:01:00.250> straight<00:01:00.549> very<00:01:01.509> slow<00:01:01.839> hairpin<00:01:02.229> so<00:01:02.530> we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
short straight very slow hairpin so we

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.829 
short straight very slow hairpin so we
go<00:01:02.769> back<00:01:02.799> to<00:01:02.979> first<00:01:03.339> gear<00:01:03.519> actually<00:01:03.970> i<00:01:04.180> started

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
go back to first gear actually i started

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.539 
go back to first gear actually i started
in<00:01:04.930> second<00:01:05.350> gear<00:01:05.470> taking<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.009> second<00:01:06.400> gear

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
in second gear taking in the second gear

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.429 
in second gear taking in the second gear
but<00:01:06.820> then<00:01:07.180> Peter<00:01:07.420> showed<00:01:07.689> me<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.930> way<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.079> take

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
but then Peter showed me the way to take

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.719 
but then Peter showed me the way to take
in<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.619> first<00:01:08.860> gear<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.369> was<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.549> bit

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
in the first gear and it was a bit

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.940 
in the first gear and it was a bit
faster<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:10.329> now<00:01:10.869> we're<00:01:11.049> up<00:01:11.079> in<00:01:11.320> first<00:01:11.740> gear

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
faster so now we're up in first gear

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.130 
faster so now we're up in first gear
there<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.970> accelerate<00:01:13.900> a<00:01:13.930> bit

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
there and then you accelerate a bit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.200 
there and then you accelerate a bit
faster<00:01:14.590> he<00:01:15.040> bows<00:01:15.220> didn't<00:01:15.549> knew<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.729> track<00:01:15.939> so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
faster he bows didn't knew the track so

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.819 
faster he bows didn't knew the track so
we<00:01:16.689> have<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.900> learn<00:01:17.049> they're<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.290> bit<00:01:17.500> it's<00:01:17.680> up

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
we have to learn they're a bit it's up

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.410 
we have to learn they're a bit it's up
and<00:01:17.979> down<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.460> don't<00:01:18.520> see<00:01:18.790> many<00:01:19.119> of<00:01:19.299> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
and down so you don't see many of the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.120 
and down so you don't see many of the
corners<00:01:19.720> coming<00:01:19.900> so<00:01:20.140> that's<00:01:20.350> quite<00:01:20.590> quite

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
corners coming so that's quite quite

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.989 
corners coming so that's quite quite
tricky<00:01:21.369> there<00:01:22.319> so<00:01:23.319> we're<00:01:23.799> coming<00:01:23.979> up<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.189> one

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
tricky there so we're coming up to one

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.340 
tricky there so we're coming up to one
of<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.179> fastest<00:01:25.630> parts<00:01:25.929> of<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.109> tribe

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
of the fastest parts of the tribe

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.929 
of the fastest parts of the tribe
fastest-growing<00:01:26.890> oh<00:01:27.189> you've<00:01:27.340> come<00:01:27.520> down<00:01:27.549> this

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
fastest-growing oh you've come down this

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.169 
fastest-growing oh you've come down this
hill<00:01:28.210> flat<00:01:28.960> out<00:01:29.170> now<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.590> fourth<00:01:30.219> gear<00:01:30.429> up<00:01:30.969> to

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
hill flat out now in fourth gear up to

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.719 
hill flat out now in fourth gear up to
fifth<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.630> then<00:01:32.289> heartbreaking<00:01:33.189> over<00:01:33.639> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
fifth and then heartbreaking over the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.489 
fifth and then heartbreaking over the
brow<00:01:33.909> again<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.569> see<00:01:34.600> we<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.170> can't<00:01:35.409> see

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
brow again you can see we you can't see

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.349 
brow again you can see we you can't see
anything<00:01:35.829> if<00:01:36.159> when<00:01:36.670> you're<00:01:36.789> sitting<00:01:36.969> low<00:01:37.179> down

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
anything if when you're sitting low down

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.330 
anything if when you're sitting low down
in<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.600> car<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:38.020> quite<00:01:38.170> difficult<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.889> you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
in the car it's quite difficult so you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.279 
in the car it's quite difficult so you
have<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.520> tight<00:01:39.729> right-hander<00:01:40.049> still<00:01:41.049> stuck

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
have a tight right-hander still stuck

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.870 
have a tight right-hander still stuck
behind<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.649> same<00:01:41.920> car<00:01:42.189> he<00:01:42.399> was<00:01:42.429> really

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
behind the same car he was really

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.059 
behind the same car he was really
beginning<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.359> annoy<00:01:43.600> me<00:01:43.780> at<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:43.990> stage<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.499> I

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
beginning to annoy me at this stage so I

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.520 
beginning to annoy me at this stage so I
think<00:01:45.579> from<00:01:45.939> this<00:01:46.090> corner<00:01:46.359> this<00:01:46.959> tight

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
think from this corner this tight

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.620 
think from this corner this tight
left-hander<00:01:48.100> here<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.310> start<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.880> let<00:01:49.359> him<00:01:49.479> go

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
left-hander here I start to let him go
