stray away and maybe more casual players
but<00:01:35.950> like<00:01:36.039> yeah<00:01:36.249> I<00:01:36.279> maybe<00:01:36.759> get<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:37.029> those<00:01:37.119> later

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
but like yeah I maybe get to those later

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.749 
but like yeah I maybe get to those later
you<00:01:37.659> know<00:01:37.689> but<00:01:38.349> you<00:01:38.529> can<00:01:38.649> check<00:01:38.770> them<00:01:38.950> out<00:01:39.069> as

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
you know but you can check them out as

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.129 
you know but you can check them out as
you<00:01:39.939> go<00:01:39.969> which<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.359> nice<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.779> what<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:40.990> did

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
you go which is nice and what we did

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.749 
you go which is nice and what we did
with<00:01:41.649> those<00:01:41.770> levels<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.310> there's<00:01:42.459> a<00:01:42.520> unique

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
with those levels is there's a unique

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.550 
with those levels is there's a unique
property<00:01:43.029> where

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
property where

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.710 
property where
all<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.280> enemies<00:01:45.520> are<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:45.670> ghosts<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.600> now

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
all of the enemies are now ghosts so now

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.469 
all of the enemies are now ghosts so now
your<00:01:46.990> shots<00:01:47.320> go<00:01:47.470> right<00:01:47.680> through<00:01:47.890> them<00:01:48.479> too

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
your shots go right through them too

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.179 
your shots go right through them too
though<00:01:49.720> now<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.200> more<00:01:50.409> kind<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.680> avoiding

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
though now it's more kind of avoiding

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.499 
though now it's more kind of avoiding
them<00:01:51.310> rather<00:01:51.549> than<00:01:51.700> shooting<00:01:52.000> them<00:01:52.240> which<00:01:52.360> is

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
them rather than shooting them which is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.179 
them rather than shooting them which is
which<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.170> cool<00:01:53.320> West<00:01:53.530> even<00:01:53.829> for<00:01:53.979> me<00:01:54.070> I'm

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
which is cool West even for me I'm

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.679 
which is cool West even for me I'm
playing<00:01:54.460> I'm<00:01:54.640> like<00:01:54.820> are<00:01:55.000> just<00:01:55.299> nice<00:01:55.420> because

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
playing I'm like are just nice because

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.420 
playing I'm like are just nice because
you're<00:01:55.810> kind<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:55.990> nimbly<00:01:56.710> jumping<00:01:57.070> around<00:01:57.159> go

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
you're kind of nimbly jumping around go

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.340 
you're kind of nimbly jumping around go
they<00:01:58.060> kind<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.420> nearly<00:01:58.689> getting<00:01:58.869> hit<00:01:59.320> by

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
they kind of like nearly getting hit by

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.990 
they kind of like nearly getting hit by
them<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.890> trying<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.159> avoid<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.549> now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
them and trying to avoid it and now

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.550 
them and trying to avoid it and now
collecting<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.539> diamonds<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.110> even<00:02:02.380> more

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
collecting the diamonds is even more

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.810 
collecting the diamonds is even more
interesting<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.250> challenging<00:02:03.429> because

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
interesting and challenging because

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.460 
interesting and challenging because
trying<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.450> collect<00:02:04.659> them<00:02:04.869> while<00:02:05.200> avoiding

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
trying to collect them while avoiding

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.200 
trying to collect them while avoiding
this<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:06.009> inch<00:02:06.280> mark<00:02:06.610> that's<00:02:06.820> going<00:02:06.909> back

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
this little inch mark that's going back

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.570 
this little inch mark that's going back
and<00:02:07.329> forth<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:08.050> it's<00:02:08.289> fun<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.489> then

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
and forth and it's fun so and then

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.809 
and forth and it's fun so and then
beyond<00:02:09.819> now<00:02:10.000> adding<00:02:10.420> new<00:02:10.599> ghost<00:02:11.200> enemies

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
beyond now adding new ghost enemies

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.030 
beyond now adding new ghost enemies
throughout<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.970> levels<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.860> some<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
throughout the levels and some of the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.460 
throughout the levels and some of the
levels<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:16.200> situations<00:02:17.200> where<00:02:17.319> you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
levels will have situations where you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.750 
there'll be a ghost shot power off that
you<00:02:26.319> can<00:02:26.470> collect<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.459> gives<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
you can collect then it gives you a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
you make it in a situation where you may

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.220 
you make it in a situation where you may
have<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> figure<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> right<00:02:43.720> timing<00:02:44.019> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
have to figure out the right timing of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.080 
have to figure out the right timing of
that<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.220> past<00:02:45.489> there

bringing this title from the 3ds which

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.059 
bringing this title from the 3ds which
was<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> 3d<00:03:45.940> game<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.019> Wii<00:03:47.170> U<00:03:47.410> which<00:03:47.680> uses

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
was a 3d game to the Wii U which uses

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.440 
was a 3d game to the Wii U which uses
the<00:03:48.280> U<00:03:48.580> gamepad<00:03:49.030> well<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:50.739> knew<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.879> 3d

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
the U gamepad well we knew that the 3d

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.910 
the U gamepad well we knew that the 3d
aspects<00:03:53.019> obviously<00:03:53.319> wasn't<00:03:53.440> gonna<00:03:53.590> be<00:03:53.709> there

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
aspects obviously wasn't gonna be there

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.759 
aspects obviously wasn't gonna be there
so<00:03:54.220> we<00:03:55.000> added<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.810> blower<00:03:56.230> depth<00:03:56.650> of

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
so we added the the blower depth of

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.290 
so we added the the blower depth of
field<00:03:56.980> kind<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.250> effect<00:03:57.550> so<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.849> you<00:03:57.940> get<00:03:58.030> far

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
field kind of effect so if you get far

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.339 
field kind of effect so if you get far
in<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.450> background<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.930> foreground<00:03:59.230> is
