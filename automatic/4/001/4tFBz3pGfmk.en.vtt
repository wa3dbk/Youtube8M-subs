00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
certainly we went all the the drum core

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.490 
certainly we went all the the drum core
elements<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.600> be<00:00:13.629> there<00:00:13.869> in<00:00:13.959> terms<00:00:14.170> of<00:00:14.260> playing

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.830 
elements to be there in terms of playing
and<00:00:14.889> spinning<00:00:15.610> and<00:00:15.730> marching<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.360> everything

the<00:00:16.930> Cavaliers<00:00:17.320> are<00:00:17.590> known<00:00:18.070> for<00:00:18.310> doing<00:00:18.550> really

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
the Cavaliers are known for doing really

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.669 
the Cavaliers are known for doing really
well<00:00:18.970> but<00:00:19.390> we<00:00:19.480> also<00:00:19.630> want<00:00:19.929> to<00:00:20.019> raise<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.439> bar

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
well but we also want to raise that bar

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.589 
well but we also want to raise that bar
when<00:00:20.830> it<00:00:20.920> comes<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.279> production<00:00:21.939> we're

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
when it comes to production we're

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.630 
when it comes to production we're
working<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:22.960> bring<00:00:23.560> choreographic<00:00:24.279> elements

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
working to bring choreographic elements

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.009 
working to bring choreographic elements
integrated<00:00:25.269> with<00:00:25.359> drill<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:25.720> it's<00:00:25.869> not<00:00:25.960> just

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
integrated with drill so it's not just

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.019 
integrated with drill so it's not just
marching<00:00:26.470> from<00:00:26.589> point<00:00:26.830> A<00:00:26.919> to<00:00:26.949> point<00:00:27.070> B<00:00:27.339> but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
marching from point A to point B but

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.159 
marching from point A to point B but
it's<00:00:28.269> almost<00:00:28.390> going<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:29.019> third

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
it's almost going to that third

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.599 
it's almost going to that third
dimension<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:29.890> you<00:00:30.130> got<00:00:30.279> to<00:00:30.310> find<00:00:30.550> that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
dimension and you got to find that

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.900 
dimension and you got to find that
balancing<00:00:31.240> point<00:00:31.720> where<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.590> create<00:00:33.280> shows

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
balancing point where you create shows

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.209 
balancing point where you create shows
that<00:00:34.270> speak<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.289> to<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.559> history<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.070> the

that speak to the to the history of the
group<00:00:36.399> as<00:00:36.579> well<00:00:37.149> as<00:00:37.329> you<00:00:37.600> try<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.809> push<00:00:38.050> the

group as well as you try to push the
activity<00:00:38.530> forward<00:00:38.860> as<00:00:38.980> well<00:00:39.460> as<00:00:39.640> involve<00:00:40.059> the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
guys see what I write sometimes its

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.240 
guys see what I write sometimes its
soundtrack<00:01:10.840> driven<00:01:11.380> sometimes<00:01:11.920> it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
soundtrack driven sometimes it's

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.080 
soundtrack driven sometimes it's
musically<00:01:12.880> driven<00:01:13.270> but<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.650> always

result<00:01:19.150> hopefully<00:01:19.570> being<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.960> cumulative

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
result hopefully being a cumulative

result hopefully being a cumulative
cohesive<00:01:21.580> event<00:01:21.910> where<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.330> sum<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
cohesive event where the sum of the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.480 
cohesive event where the sum of the
whole<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.260> stronger<00:01:23.560> than<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.800> parts<00:01:24.100> because

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
whole is stronger than the parts because

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.070 
whole is stronger than the parts because
of<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.850> collective<00:01:25.270> nature<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.750> both<00:01:25.900> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
of the collective nature of both the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.670 
of the collective nature of both the
audio<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> visual

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
audio in the visual

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.750 
audio in the visual
for<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> guard<00:01:28.980> I<00:01:29.070> mean<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
for the guard I mean I think that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.820 
for the guard I mean I think that
they're<00:01:29.940> pretty<00:01:30.180> crazy<00:01:30.750> anyway<00:01:31.380> they're

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
they're pretty crazy anyway they're

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.190 
they're pretty crazy anyway they're
Daredevils<00:01:32.580> they<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> attempt<00:01:33.750> what

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Daredevils they like to attempt what

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
Daredevils they like to attempt what
people<00:01:34.590> can't<00:01:34.800> do<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.340> love<00:01:35.550> doing<00:01:35.580> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
people can't do and they love doing that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780 
people can't do and they love doing that
so<00:01:36.330> why<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.810> make<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> show<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.550> about

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
so why not make this show for them about

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
so why not make this show for them about
them<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> guys<00:01:40.050> are<00:01:40.110> doing

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
them we we see what the guys are doing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.840 
them we we see what the guys are doing
and<00:01:40.620> then<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.800> try<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.010> incorporate<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.670> into

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and then we try to incorporate that into

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then we try to incorporate that into
the<00:01:42.030> show<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.530> textbook<00:01:44.220> show

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the show so it's not a textbook show

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.270 
the show so it's not a textbook show
that's<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.930> created<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> winter

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that's you know created in the winter

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.390 
that's you know created in the winter
and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.700> taught<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:49.010> your<00:01:50.010> your

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
and then it's taught it's your your

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.980 
and then it's taught it's your your
teaching<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.910> your<00:01:51.000> learning<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
teaching and your learning with the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
teaching and your learning with the
members<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.650> if<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.580> something<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
members and if they do something that
