a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.210> students<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.869> confused<00:01:09.900> by

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
a lot of my students get confused by

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
a lot of my students get confused by
that<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.280> say<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:11.909> why<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that because they say you know why is it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
that because they say you know why is it
back<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.020> front<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> real<00:01:14.549> guitar<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
back to front that on a real guitar the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
back to front that on a real guitar the
sixth<00:01:15.450> string<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> first

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
sixth string is at the top and the first

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
sixth string is at the top and the first
rings<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> bottom<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.759> why<00:01:17.909> did<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.150> do

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
rings at the bottom so why did they do

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
rings at the bottom so why did they do
it<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.750> around<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.950> answer<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it the other way around and my answer is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
it the other way around and my answer is
I<00:01:20.970> don't<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.450> didn't<00:01:21.930> design<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> system

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
I don't know I didn't design the system

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
I don't know I didn't design the system
but<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.850> say<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.420> worry<00:01:24.689> about

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but what I will say is don't worry about

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
but what I will say is don't worry about
it<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.320> you'll<00:01:25.650> quickly<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.250> used<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it because you'll quickly get used to it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
it because you'll quickly get used to it
and<00:01:26.880> after<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> while<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.509> won't<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:27.840> think

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
and after a while you won't even think

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
and after a while you won't even think
about<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.590> you'll<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:29.070> able<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> read<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
about it you'll just be able to read the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
about it you'll just be able to read the
notes<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.200> totally<00:01:31.740> effortlessly

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
notes you know at totally effortlessly

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.179 
notes you know at totally effortlessly
now<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.270> happens<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> number<00:01:34.680> on

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
now what happens is we put a number on

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
now what happens is we put a number on
the<00:01:35.729> line<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> number<00:01:36.750> represents<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the line and the number represents the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.010 
the line and the number represents the
fret<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:37.890> playing<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.939> example<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.630> we

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
fret we're playing so for example if we

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
fret we're playing so for example if we
were<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> play<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> sixth<00:01:40.950> string<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.310> fret

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
were to play the sixth string at fret

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
were to play the sixth string at fret
one<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
one what you would see is this the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
one what you would see is this the
number<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.610> bottom<00:01:47.759> line<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.390> course

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
number one on the bottom line of course

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.630 
number one on the bottom line of course
that<00:01:48.780> represents<00:01:49.320> fret<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.369> sixth

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that represents fret one on the sixth

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
that represents fret one on the sixth
string<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.079> were<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> play<00:01:52.380> fret<00:01:52.649> 2<00:01:52.890> on

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
string and if we were to play fret 2 on

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.470 
string and if we were to play fret 2 on
the<00:01:53.189> sixth<00:01:53.490> string

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
the sixth string

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.640 
the sixth string
meteor<00:01:55.140> number<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.100> fret<00:01:56.370> 3<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> fret
