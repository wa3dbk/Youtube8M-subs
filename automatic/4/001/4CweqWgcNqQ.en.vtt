probably going to delete him unless we

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830

this<00:01:59.820> hate<00:01:59.969> thing<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.649> he's<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this hate thing going on he's much I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.760 
this hate thing going on he's much I
start<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.579> he's<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> win<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:04.500> just
