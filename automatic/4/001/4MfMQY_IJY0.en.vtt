and this wands pretty bent but mmm oh
ones<00:02:48.320> are<00:02:48.590> pretty<00:02:48.860> bent<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.220> figured<00:02:49.550> out<00:02:49.670> by

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
ones are pretty bent I figured out by

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.880 
ones are pretty bent I figured out by
watching<00:02:50.270> videos<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.780> stuff<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.770> don't

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
watching videos and stuff like you don't

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.470 
watching videos and stuff like you don't
really<00:02:52.040> usually<00:02:52.490> don't<00:02:52.910> get<00:02:53.030> perfectly

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
really usually don't get perfectly

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.100 
really usually don't get perfectly
straight<00:02:53.960> ones<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.310> actually<00:02:56.080> when<00:02:57.080> I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
straight ones and I actually when I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.479 
straight ones and I actually when I
first<00:02:57.170> got<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:57.650> one<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> was<00:02:58.100> pretty<00:02:58.280> mad

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
first got this one I was pretty mad

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.000 
first got this one I was pretty mad
about<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.510> called<00:03:00.440> up<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.680> noble

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
about it so I called up the noble

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.740 
about it so I called up the noble
collection<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.580> they<00:03:01.670> were<00:03:01.790> really<00:03:02.600> nice

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
collection and they were really nice

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.120 
collection and they were really nice
about<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.200> they<00:03:03.290> sent<00:03:03.470> me<00:03:03.500> another<00:03:03.770> one<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
about and they sent me another one and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.820 
about and they sent me another one and
it's<00:03:04.910> not<00:03:05.209> quite<00:03:05.959> as<00:03:06.110> curved<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.650> still

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
it's not quite as curved but it's still

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.820 
it's not quite as curved but it's still
curved<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:08.150> figured<00:03:08.540> if<00:03:08.690> they're<00:03:08.959> good<00:03:09.080> if

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
curved and I figured if they're good if

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.229 
curved and I figured if they're good if
I<00:03:09.890> got<00:03:10.010> another<00:03:10.250> one<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:10.640> curved<00:03:10.820> -<00:03:11.030> it's

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
I got another one and it's curved - it's

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.670 
I got another one and it's curved - it's
just<00:03:11.390> going<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.630> be<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> same<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.380> next

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
just going to be the same with the next

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.790 
just going to be the same with the next
the<00:03:12.830> next<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.730> forth<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
the next one and so forth so I have that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.320 
the next one and so forth so I have that
one<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.070> just<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:16.520> really<00:03:16.760> taking<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.239> out

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
one I just don't really taking it out

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.930 
one I just don't really taking it out
that's<00:03:20.330> straight<00:03:20.690> goes<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.580> comes<00:03:22.580> out<00:03:22.730> to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
that's straight goes and comes out to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.000 
that's straight goes and comes out to
more<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.239> flat<00:03:23.480> edge<00:03:23.690> than<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> point<00:03:24.770> just

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
more of a flat edge than a point just

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.880 
more of a flat edge than a point just
like<00:03:25.640> Lucius<00:03:26.390> Malfoy<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.989> that's<00:03:30.500> his<00:03:30.650> wand

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
like Lucius Malfoy so that's his wand

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.420 
like Lucius Malfoy so that's his wand
and<00:03:32.050> next<00:03:33.050> I'll<00:03:33.200> make<00:03:33.500> Harry<00:03:33.709> Potter's<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
then sometime in the future I'll make

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.970 
then sometime in the future I'll make
all<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:38.090> together<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:39.290> Triwizard<00:03:39.530> want
