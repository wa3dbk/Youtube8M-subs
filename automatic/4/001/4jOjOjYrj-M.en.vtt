together<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:14.209> not<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.230> layer

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
together so it's not just like a layer

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.440 
together so it's not just like a layer
of<00:02:15.620> flour<00:02:16.070> Lee<00:02:16.549> or<00:02:16.670> sugar<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.239> layer<00:02:17.420> of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
of flour Lee or sugar and a layer of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.990 
of flour Lee or sugar and a layer of
cocoa<00:02:18.200> powder<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.620> need<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.890> all<00:02:19.040> mixed

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
cocoa powder you need it all mixed

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.020 
cocoa powder you need it all mixed
together<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:21.860> next<00:02:22.250> you're<00:02:22.670> going<00:02:22.910> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
together so then next you're going to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.090 
together so then next you're going to
add<00:02:23.269> two<00:02:24.140> tablespoons<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.850> oil<00:02:26.410> 2<00:02:27.410> tablespoons
