00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello my name is sax solo here at home 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.000
 for tired trying to understand what 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.099
 passes in the head of the bank's president 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.190
 central looks inflation is rising 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 all indexes and indicate that it will 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 keep climbing 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 market expectation is that the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.820
 inflation will remain high than the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.699
 president of the central bank comes to say 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.010
 it implies that the cycle of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 interest rate increase is coming 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.340
 to the end 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 look who just do not understand how to explain the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.770
 idea is the following the government makes a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 monetary tightening and monetary tightening 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.850
 combating inflation is not difficult to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.600
 understand 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 There are times when I say I do not 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.610
 interest rate is increased if the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 central bank does not diminish the credit 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 because economy because the engine 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.629
 inflation rate transmission 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 it's an idea of â€‹â€‹monetary tightening 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 then when the government raised interest 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.950
 idea that it is signaling a squeeze 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.369
 monetary policy and inflation 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 now my friends and when the central bank 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.340
 increases interest on one hand it goes 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 increase the credit for the other does not 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.280
 monetary tightening no result 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 increases if interest and inflation falls 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 there a lot of people love because 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.810
 never falls because you're not doing it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 monetary tightening does not just increase 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 interest 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 the idea of â€‹â€‹tightening interest rates is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.009
 that when interest is increased 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.619
 Are you giving a monetary squeeze already? 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.540
 tossing coins from the economy 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.280
 sometimes if you raise interest rates and 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.930
 increases credit is not occurring 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.899
 monetary tightening 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.060
 ie you do not fight against inflation 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.610
 a hope of fighting inflation was 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.100
 the next was the central bank convince 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.200
 the agents that he is trying to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.619
 at least to combat inflation 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 inflation expectations 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 falling what happens inflation ends 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.680
 falling down 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 looks at the overwhelming majority of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.569
 all show that the expectation of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.489
 inflation is fundamental 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.939
 then when inflation expectations 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.459
 fell inflation also falls that the bank 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.769
 central bank does what the bank's 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.849
 central does he give interview to say 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.739
 that will end 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.439
 is ending the cycle of interest increase or 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.609
 either the monetary tightening is ending 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.930
 which has not occurred what the agents 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.700
 imagine to imagine that the bank 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 is not serious about combating 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.879
 inflation inflation is above target the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.489
 inflation is there close to above 6% and 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.560
 central bank says it's already over 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.109
 the monetary tightening 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.909
 we then said the central bank is 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.439
 combating inflation neither anything nor 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.260
 wants to combat inflation 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.359
 that is, expectations continue to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.019
 high inflation inflation will continue 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.450
 High ie the ways that exists 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.560
 to combat inflation that is 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.730
 expectations the central bank is 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.370
 throwing in the trash 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.409
 not only by this absurd pronouncement 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.569
 the president of the central bank as 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.609
 also because of the fact that a year ago 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.150
 well over a year the central bank 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.590
 missed 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.949
 should have increased interest not 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.829
 Then you pick up a series of 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:31.400
 expectations over the past few 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.049
 23 years add up to this pronouncement 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.870
 absurdity of the central bank president 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.609
 and you have what the deterioration of 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.479
 inflation expectations 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.489
 on the other side you have what the bank 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.479
 center is increasing child care 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.799
 economy 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:52.769
 It is clear that inflation does not fall 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.889
 Look at blame the chuchu for 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.129
 to blame the tomato enough to blame the beans 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:02.220
 Carolyn, I'm going to stop blaming potatoes. 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.489
 inflation is the fault of the bad policy 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.739
 the central bank's monetary policy has been 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.599
 also of the poor fiscal policy of the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.329
 government to spend right 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.879
 it is difficult then the culprits for 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.699
 inflation in Brazil today is what is the 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:22.889
 excess of public expenditure in a bank 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.960
 that I honestly think the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.820
 good holiday era can go to the board 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.270
 the central bank who knows if they 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.530
 are 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.449
 they to do so much bullshit 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.889
 So, look, it's time for the cup to arrive. 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.810
 tourist in brazil 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.580
 I do not doubt the central bank speaks. 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.069
 look inflation is rising every cup 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.310
 of the world that has a lot of tourists buying 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.110
 here the good price went up for those who buy the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.360
 carioquinha beans I do not doubt anything 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.009
 is blaming the world cup there for 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.039
 cause of inflation in brazil 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.409
 the face of God Love of omingo 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.419
 seriousness of the central bank is necessary 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.479
 my name is the fax of I hope you have 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.479
