00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
just everything on the channel so we

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
just everything on the channel so we
don't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> fucking<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.329> anything

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
because it's just so annoying like I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
because it's just so annoying like I
don't<00:02:05.880> see<00:02:06.090> why<00:02:06.360> someone<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> close

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
don't see why someone want to close

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.869 
don't see why someone want to close
their<00:02:07.619> own<00:02:07.740> channel<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.340> worked<00:02:08.580> hard

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
their own channel that they worked hard

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.820 
their own channel that they worked hard
on<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.840> make<00:02:09.899> any<00:02:09.959> sense<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.349> me<00:02:10.470> but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
on it doesn't make any sense to me but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
on it doesn't make any sense to me but
maybe<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.640> making<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.090> sense<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
maybe it was making a little sense to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.150 
maybe it was making a little sense to
him<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> time

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
