00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
applying a flesh colour with the sponge

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.550 
applying a flesh colour with the sponge
exactly<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> center<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> forehead

and<00:00:20.010> after<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.449> will<00:00:21.660> apply<00:00:21.779> some<00:00:22.380> blue

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and after that I will apply some blue

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
and after that I will apply some blue
paint<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.730> eyelids<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:24.810> drag<00:00:25.080> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
eyes approach one so you can see that

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.729 
eyes approach one so you can see that
because<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:45.150> angle<00:03:45.719> of<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:45.840> camera<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.469> still
