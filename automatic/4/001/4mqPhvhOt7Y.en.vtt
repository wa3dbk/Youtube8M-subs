sharp flavors if you know what I mean

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.959 
sharp flavors if you know what I mean
like<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> rule<00:00:34.320> sharp<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> acid<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
like the rule sharp right the acid or I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
like the rule sharp right the acid or I
don't<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> explain<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.170> they're

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
don't know how to explain it but they're

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
don't know how to explain it but they're
just<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> rule<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> taste<00:00:38.370> them<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.730> like

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
just the rule you taste them it's like

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180 
just the rule you taste them it's like
whoa<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> rolls<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.800> into<00:00:41.040> some

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
whoa and then it rolls off into some

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
whoa and then it rolls off into some
celery<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.809> those<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> three

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
celery and so those are the three

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
celery and so those are the three
predominant<00:00:43.739> flavors<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.129> taste<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
predominant flavors I don't taste the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
predominant flavors I don't taste the
Apple<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.329> don't<00:00:45.480> taste<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> kale

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
Apple at all and I don't taste the kale

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.610 
Apple at all and I don't taste the kale
so<00:00:46.350> that's<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.520> man<00:00:47.700> hmm<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> did

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so that's good but man hmm and all I did

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
so that's good but man hmm and all I did
was<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.950> took<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.489> juice<00:00:50.730> recipe<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> cut<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
was I took the juice recipe and I cut it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
was I took the juice recipe and I cut it
in<00:00:51.750> half<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> barely<00:00:52.949> fit<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in half and it barely fit into the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
in half and it barely fit into the
nutribullet<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> barely<00:00:55.260> fit<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
nutribullet like it barely fit I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
nutribullet like it barely fit I
probably<00:00:56.850> should<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.149> used<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.539> celery

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
probably should have used more celery

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.549 
probably should have used more celery
