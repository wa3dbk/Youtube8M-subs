00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
outcome and let's just flip that one

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.689 
outcome and let's just flip that one
over<00:02:50.419> and<00:02:51.049> this<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.949> a<00:02:51.980> great<00:02:52.189> reading<00:02:52.459> because

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699 
over and this is a great reading because

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.640 
over and this is a great reading because
here<00:02:52.879> we<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.150> at<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.419> top<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:54.199> outcome<00:02:54.620> of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
here we have at the top the outcome of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.759 
here we have at the top the outcome of
this<00:02:54.889> situation<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:55.669> self<00:02:55.909> acceptance<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.959> I

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
this situation is self acceptance and I

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.439 
this situation is self acceptance and I
think<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.159> all<00:02:58.310> ties<00:02:58.639> in<00:02:58.939> really<00:02:58.969> well

00:02:59.439 --> 00:02:59.449 
think that all ties in really well

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.929 
think that all ties in really well
together<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.169> you<00:03:00.620> know<00:03:00.709> once<00:03:00.949> we've<00:03:01.189> really

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
together so you know once we've really

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.280 
together so you know once we've really
learned<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.209> love<00:03:02.419> ourselves<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.109> honor

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
learned to love ourselves and honor

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.409 
learned to love ourselves and honor
ourselves<00:03:03.530> by<00:03:04.010> retreating<00:03:04.400> than<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.239> outcome

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
ourselves by retreating than the outcome

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.270 
ourselves by retreating than the outcome
of<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.810> situation<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.709> self-acceptance

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
of this situation is self-acceptance

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.360

self<00:03:08.209> acceptance<00:03:08.959> by<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.290> way<00:03:09.500> always<00:03:09.769> leads

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
self acceptance by the way always leads

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.819 
self acceptance by the way always leads
to<00:03:10.639> radical<00:03:11.090> health<00:03:11.329> in<00:03:11.510> our<00:03:11.659> bodies<00:03:11.989> because

to radical health in our bodies because

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.360 
to radical health in our bodies because
