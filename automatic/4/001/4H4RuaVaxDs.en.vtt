00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.550
 it's time for the counterattack 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.880
 one of the most important tactics during the game 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.909
 The main goal of the counter-attack is to make the team 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.960
 defending gets to the opponents a little faster the chance of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.680
 finalization 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 so speed is key 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
 Another important thing is the accuracy of the passes 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.720
 in the first case the advantage 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.130
 held by the marker always 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.010
 at the beginning of the game the ball goes to the right player 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 If I get through the opposition 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.370
 the team arrives at the destination itself common weapon in the man over 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.060
 signaling is done in the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.770
 so the fish 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 depending on the marking 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 I see again 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.390
 now let's see an exit equals 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 but with a different ending 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.380
 this time the defense marked positions 2 and 3 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.439
 leaving the player who was closest to the goal free 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.130
