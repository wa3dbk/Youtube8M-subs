00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.770
 us as solid one of our 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.510
 programs is to look for these joints 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.580
 that offer good materials 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.500
 worked through the talent of 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.210
 students in good design schools 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.220
 and that in the end it's going to be sold in a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.559
 Excellent retail store is a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.030
 project that unites synergies of each 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.519
 of those of the companies and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.559
 involved and in the end we believe that it is 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.909
 a success story that is just what 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.089
 we want a furniture industry 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.979
 consolidated I think it's a moment 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.379
 great what is happening in 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.840
 Mexico has been cultivating and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.820
 working on design issues throughout 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.400
 of the last decades from my point of 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.110
 view and little by little they start to 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.150
 consolidate highly jobs 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 professionals the collaboration that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.770
 we are looking for this time between 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.600
 solid precisely rigoletti us 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 that this project does not stay in a 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.729
 sterile ground if not carried beyond 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.039
 one of the great opportunities that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.079
 you seldom see is that a new 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.049
 designer or someone who is doing 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.600
 his pininos the theme of the design have the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.119
 opportunity for your designs to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.119
 consider to enter the part 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.659
 commercial really the word more 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.700
 interesting here is in the casino 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.020
 we encourage this type of link 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.310
 between teaching between the actor that is the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.909
 merchant 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.909
 the manufacturer I think there is not this 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.189
 there are no projects with solid because it was a 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.840
 new and very interesting experience for 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.739
 the students for us as 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.569
 teachers go to the factories and see all 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.720
 these new trends that are being 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.140
 achieving the beautiful colors finished 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.010
 and armed 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.470
 I would define it with the word opportunity 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.400
 opportunity on the part of rigor 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.930
 lety to do palace in solid because and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.710
 not only opportunity for my opportunity 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.920
 for all the designers of mexico 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.690
 Well, I think the most important thing is the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.690
 collaborative work that you need 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.520
 work with people from all areas and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 Well now I have to receive 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.960
 feedback open your projects 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.360

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.520
