00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:20.100
 Do not cry for me Argentinaa! 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500
 That's all I know about Argentina. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.300
 Everything about Argentina is about my history of selling wines to people 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800
 and the good wine they produce, which is one of the best in the world. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.300
 They have Carmenere, Malbec, and beautiful beautiful red wines. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.100
 Let's talk about the rules of this tour: 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.580
 We have forbidden to say the word "drunk". 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 We are not drunk people. 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.700
 We're going to replace it with "happy." 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.780
 So we can measure our level of happiness, 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.115
 a little happy, 

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:03.600
 fairly happy, 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.934
 cheerful happiness 

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.034
 we'll see! 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000
 what they see here in front is Malbec, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.340
 the typical Mendoza wine. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 Mendoza treats% 100 about his wine, 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.240
 and about his Malbec. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 An Argentine Malbec bought here costs 3 dollars, 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.520
 and it is equivalent to an Argentine Malbec of 30 dollars in Canada or the United States. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.540
 To taste the wine we will take the cup from its base or its stem, 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.440
 so as not to heat the wine with our hands on the body of the glass. 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 When they take it towards the nose, they will feel fruit flavors, very aromatic. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 Well, here we are going to drink a lot of wine! 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.560
 They are going to prove how good wine is here in Mendoza. 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.320
 We have syrah, we also have malbec, of course they know it since it is the most common grape in Mendoza. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:48.280
 In Argentina we usually drink 37 liters per year! Now we are planting special grapes, called fine grapes. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.580
 It's almost as if you're about to drink a Vergimenor or a Riesling. 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.700
 And then, when you gave him a sip there was a very dry end to that ... 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200
 Nobody knows what you are talking about. 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.340
 It's like not knowing anything about wine. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 When we landed in Buenos Aires we went to Milhouse Avenue, 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.080
 Hello Michael, welcome to Milhouse Avenue, do you want to go? my name is Agustina. 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.240
 a huge and very crazy hostel, there are a couple of them in Buenos Aires, it is a beautiful place to stay. 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.640
 Well, do you want me to show you the place? 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 Adelante Maids are the best. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.480
 This was Milhouse Avenue! there is also another one who, if they want, can come and see it. Well bye!! 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.640
 Bicycle tour !! 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.280
 When I started that trip, I knew that taking many cameras with me would be a threat, and I was very aware of it. 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.600
 But this is what happened when I went to this peculiar part of Buenos Aires. I ran into a really bad guy. 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.240
 A dramatic video of a robbery in Argentina. 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.720
 A tourist in Argentina 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.080
 The GoPro captures everything, including this armed robbery in Buenos Aires. 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.960
 On a bicycle tour in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Be careful with the bike! 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.440
 The video was viral, and everyone has seen it. 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.480
 But the last thing I want is for this video to reflect what Argentina really is, since the rest of the trip there has been wonderful. 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.080
 Enjoy the people and their culture very much. 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:06.400
 The sensuality, the music, the dances, the wine, the roasts, the families, it really is a wonderful country. 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:31.000
 and I know I capture a piece of interesting material and it is important that the world see it because there may be a little ... 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.840
 a bit of security problems in Argentina (or Buenos Aires) at the moment. 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.920
 But that should not reflect at all what the country is in general. Because I love him! I love him. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.840
 And my heart is genuinely there. 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.520
 What is he asking for? Horchata? 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.860
 Someone point you with a weapon is the international language to say, give me all your things or you die. 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.460
 I would give him a shot in the face just to stop saying "friend". 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.440
 Backpack means "backpack". 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:21.140
 Beware of those thieves who are far from learning their silly languages, better speak English or improve their nonsense. 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.540
 Take the picture of the stupid gringo walking away! 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.300
 Sorry I got confused about what route to take. 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.520
 Look at your scarf. He saw being robbed by someone very fashionable. 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.540
 'I'm running for my life. But first let me take a self photo (Selfie)!
