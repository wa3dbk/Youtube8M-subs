it's so much better you know to go in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.289 
it's so much better you know to go in
maps<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.960> actually<00:01:39.320> see<00:01:39.560> people<00:01:39.979> i<00:01:40.189> know<00:01:40.549> some

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
maps and actually see people i know some

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.890 
maps and actually see people i know some
people<00:01:41.330> could<00:01:42.080> say<00:01:42.350> it's<00:01:42.710> also<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.100> negative

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
people could say it's also a negative

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.240 
people could say it's also a negative
because<00:01:44.900> when<00:01:45.080> training<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.710> two<00:01:45.830> times<00:01:46.100> you

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
because when training for two times you

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.999 
because when training for two times you
can<00:01:46.490> release<00:01:46.820> find<00:01:47.119> spots<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.229> honestly<00:01:48.680> i

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
can release find spots but honestly i

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.980 
can release find spots but honestly i
think<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.670> server<00:01:49.909> I<00:01:50.060> plane<00:01:50.420> which<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.780> cray

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
think the server I plane which is cray

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.460 
think the server I plane which is cray
dia<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.579> server<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:52.880> plane<00:01:53.210> is<00:01:53.470> pretty

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
dia I think the server I plane is pretty

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.160 
dia I think the server I plane is pretty
much<00:01:54.619> perfectly<00:01:55.220> populated<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.119> know<00:01:56.180> people

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
much perfectly populated I know people

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.859 
much perfectly populated I know people
again<00:01:57.590> will<00:01:57.799> disagree<00:01:58.100> with<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:58.869> that's

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
again will disagree with that but that's

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.410 
again will disagree with that but that's
just<00:02:00.020> my<00:02:00.200> opinion<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.799> think<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.549> emerg<00:02:01.729> did<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
just my opinion I think the emerg did a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.230 
just my opinion I think the emerg did a
great<00:02:02.780> job<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:04.040> think<00:02:04.250> they<00:02:04.369> did<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> good

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
great job and I think they did a good

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.810 
great job and I think they did a good
job<00:02:05.299> choosing<00:02:05.780> which<00:02:06.170> servers<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.770> merge<00:02:07.040> and

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
job choosing which servers to merge and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.389 
job choosing which servers to merge and
this<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.810> again<00:02:09.200> I'm<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.649> basing<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.160> off

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
this is again I'm just basing this off

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.000
