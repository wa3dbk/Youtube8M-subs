00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello so little video about 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.900
 Benger Cinema This model is like ours 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.099
 promotional date and with erased 1 die in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 so he yes it just looks skin 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 walked in principle, the difference can be seen yes then 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.820
 there is a need to take it as if we 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 there's nothing there is this kind of tire no one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 enjoyed inside the truth was like 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.769
 a whole bunch of sawdust all there yes here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.450
 the case when u u Whether this is a miracle to me 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.040
 got evil 6 bucks i.e. 50 hryvnia 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 But in principle, I read Dasha on the forums 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.870
 fright such here such things you give 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.020
 how would we soar 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.239
 and wingers like with erased ads here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.719
 but never seen them this one when 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.489
 I pass here by the wing of the river I do not see 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 hanging think even live another 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 the Chinese then I look screwdriver 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.050
 khristova not this one is clearly not chinese 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:05.100
 then as if he noticed 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:09.479
 laid out here, we have such a stigma here but 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.610
 In principle, you can see even the originals 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.909
 there is like this girl in such here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.909
 box 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 how to use open 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 banks to screw some screws on 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.210
 By the way, let's talk more about this later. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.100
 there will be a lot of criticism vodka this uncle 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.590
 signed on land a department such and so 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 specifically for this knife to say what 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.289
 so don't like don't like 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.970
 Here we have such a very very flimsy 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.890
 blocking from this blade that is 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.679
 If here for example compare with the Chinese 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.039
 the same yes let's say so it will give points 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.409
 An exact copy of the principle is this right 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.610
 here it is much tighter here 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.729
 if for example at the rate 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.530
 from here with your finger put the frontier mode and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.009
 then how will it be so let go and she 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.250
 fell so here that is a little bit 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:21.739
 scary how would it go as far as 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:24.720
 let's say it is so critical here here 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.630
 we would then even thickness 2 mm me 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.470
 here we usually have a neodymium magnet 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.340
 let's say let's say so not the husband will see 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:42.660
 such an order of two centimeters he 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 It is removed here, that is, as it were, with. here from 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.019
 lock as such is not as well here 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.609
 here we have a principle 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.560
 let's say it can be called 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.160
 design features though more 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.450
 what is it, in my opinion, is it a dope 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.400
 here that is this again she did not 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.120
 fixed on like we have here for example on 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.160
 the same plaster here is well understood 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 Chinese copy is very accurate 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.299
 not bad when nothing rolls around and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.299
 on elevators it is about the same as 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.269
 this one is here, but here we already seem to be 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.799
 nothing fixes very very easy then 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.709
 There is if so here pay attention this 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:21.360
 I take two toes suffered chewed 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.040
 this one I fold as 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.050
 here we have this lock, that is, but 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.340
 this is not a real blend map kushies 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.209
 Pinned down figs are about to come to large 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.090
 finger push 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.500
 it is as if it does not add up if there 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.239
 bullshit we add up to benefit 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.400
 only that is, how would you like it 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.400
 I liked this old school from 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.349
 quote eye the people of a number of us 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.879
 screwdriver of course now there is no here 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.470
 principle sho here with us yet but this is on 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.019
 lover how would I such blades 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 for example, I do not like this form 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.670
 ligskie principle more like it here 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.290
 also a science that we will say a little bit 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.090
 so here we have a model of 85 length 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.250
 here is such a standard yes that is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.220
 interest is the same tinker on exactly such 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.200
 the same instruments he somewhere 91 that is 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.510
 the difference as if we have in principle yes 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.209
 the length of this here we climbed money 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.620
 such and critical that is, in length 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.520
 cutting edges think not somewhere 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.710
 identical due to this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:33.669
 here still there so we here yes that is here 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.090
 we have this yes i'm christ 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.410
 cool decided sewed need to say about 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.289
 first he is very very cool 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.910
 you're really awesome 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.470
 Unlike most Vix cars for me 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.020
 it is necessary for such and so there Podlazov 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.110
 it is not clear where to cling to them here but there is 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.270
 I have such a price without a sweep that is 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.120
 if here it is for example sewed with 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.120
 sweep yes we have this here 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.099
 verge but here we do not have it if 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.030
 acutely this this blunt she saves 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:06.340
 glitters his nose plant that is, it is not on 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.960
 exactly as a plus such a return from 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.450
 one country his finger and do not pierce you 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.570
 on the other hand, however 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.560
 put a little more effort in length 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.570
 that is, here in principle can be seen in court 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.479
 2 millimeters long in spite of their 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.400
 islam knife is shorter it is 2 millimeters somewhere 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.729
 so longer 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.219
 Go get close to us in thickness too 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.020
 principle, here you can see how much 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.260
 it is thinner that is, well, how could it not be here 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.300
 say that's better 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.340
 worse for example or vice versa that is 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.990
 just indicate the countries so their tasks she 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.710
 that is, fashion Masha hole here is not 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.250
 prevented for a long time here that is, well, how would she 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.480
 thinner 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.160
 that is, it is not necessary will not be such 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.490
 do half centimeter holes like that 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.530
 This here for example here that there is a knife such 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.340
 how would the temptations become so twofold 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.460
 impressions 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.290
 a little bit on one side 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.060
 so cute yes here we have again 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.320
 still 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.120
 toothpick but unlike vic savas 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.040
 toothpicks which is such here it is 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.880
 very very such a toothpick 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.080
 Sharply, in principle, it is already useless 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.910
 Well, let's say so useful mix of sky 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:21.350
 pintsetik here same wore 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:23.300
 pintsetik very useful here at prices 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.160
 honestly didn't understand the pricing 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.550
 I looked the same models 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.730
 approximately here we have about 101 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.200
 and classic wenger to 11 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.930
 the difference is that the one in our 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.140
 there is a corkscrew on the other we have a nail file 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.090
 for nails here here to be honest 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.210
 completely incomprehensible any Hungarian nail file 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.640
 for nails because asset is not saved on 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.350
 all as if clicking here is independence 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.000
 if there are no scissors there 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.410
 scissors 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.090
 Well, at least they made a mistake there 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.270
 screwdriver from her nail file well, not generally 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.450
 it is clear quite so here these here on the same 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.860
 new yes not worth about 200 hryvnia in 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.410
 while wenge 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.810
 in renna wendel quizzes stinger stands 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.840
 somewhere so about 130 hryvnia u so 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.630
 Here it is, but we have about 10 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.500
 bucks on top comes out and 10 bucks as it were 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:19.600
 Well, for what is not entirely clear let's say 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:22.460
 That is, wix.com is no more practical 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.380
 Here is a small reviewer 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.200
 such a knife if anyone is interested I 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:30.460
 I can tell the girls they can buy in 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.460
 In principle, all bye
