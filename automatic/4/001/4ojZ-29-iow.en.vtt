00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
I had three bundles but I actually only

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.380 
I had three bundles but I actually only
installed<00:02:00.499> two<00:02:00.859> bundles<00:02:01.310> maybe<00:02:01.789> two<00:02:02.060> bundles

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
installed two bundles maybe two bundles

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.800 
installed two bundles maybe two bundles
and<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:03.020> quarter<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.799> third<00:02:04.369> bundle<00:02:04.810> and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and a quarter of the third bundle and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.749 
and a quarter of the third bundle and
this<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.320> look<00:02:06.859> that<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.100> achieved<00:02:07.429> this<00:02:07.609> is

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
this is the look that I achieved this is

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.230 
this is the look that I achieved this is
a<00:02:07.789> thick

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
a thick

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.850 
a thick
the<00:02:08.360> fullness<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.050> achieved<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.650> this<00:02:09.740> is

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
the fullness that I achieved and this is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.000 
the fullness that I achieved and this is
exactly<00:02:10.360> exactly<00:02:11.360> what<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.900> wanted<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.530> didn't

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
exactly exactly what I wanted I didn't

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
exactly exactly what I wanted I didn't
want<00:02:13.190> anything<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.580> was<00:02:13.700> too<00:02:13.940> big<00:02:14.120> too<00:02:14.390> poufy

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
want anything that was too big too poufy

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.390 
want anything that was too big too poufy
to<00:02:14.930> unmanageable<00:02:15.620> because<00:02:15.890> i<00:02:15.980> actually<00:02:16.130> have

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
to unmanageable because i actually have

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.150 
to unmanageable because i actually have
never<00:02:16.610> had<00:02:16.940> curly<00:02:17.480> hair<00:02:17.510> um<00:02:17.980> installed<00:02:18.980> before

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
never had curly hair um installed before

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.130 
never had curly hair um installed before
and<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.640> hear<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.720> nightmare<00:02:20.960> to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and I hear that it's a nightmare to

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.470 
and I hear that it's a nightmare to
maintain<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.610> wanted<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.000> make<00:02:23.180> sure<00:02:23.240> that

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
maintain so I wanted to make sure that

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.330 
maintain so I wanted to make sure that
it<00:02:23.960> was<00:02:24.080> something<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.440> could<00:02:24.620> handle<00:02:24.800> before<00:02:25.100> I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
it was something I could handle before I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.760 
it was something I could handle before I
went<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.700> got<00:02:25.820> bigger<00:02:26.690> hair<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.410> course<00:02:27.590> I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
went and got bigger hair of course I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.050 
went and got bigger hair of course I
still<00:02:28.040> wouldn't<00:02:28.250> go<00:02:28.340> much<00:02:28.490> bigger<00:02:28.700> than<00:02:28.850> this

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
still wouldn't go much bigger than this

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.760 
still wouldn't go much bigger than this
because<00:02:29.240> i'm<00:02:29.480> actually<00:02:29.600> very<00:02:29.840> happy<00:02:30.440> with<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
because i'm actually very happy with the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.470 
because i'm actually very happy with the
look<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.430> has<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:31.940> very<00:02:32.000> natural

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
look that this has it's very natural

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.810 
look that this has it's very natural
looking<00:02:33.110> again<00:02:33.800> i<00:02:33.860> still<00:02:34.310> have<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.460> work<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:34.760> my

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
looking again i still have to work on my

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.040 
looking again i still have to work on my
blending<00:02:35.180> technique<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.930> little

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
blending technique to make it a little

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.810 
blending technique to make it a little
more<00:02:36.170> natural<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:36.920> i'm<00:02:37.280> sure<00:02:37.340> i'll<00:02:37.640> figure

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
more natural but i'm sure i'll figure

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.800 
more natural but i'm sure i'll figure
that<00:02:38.060> out<00:02:38.090> um<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.730> don't<00:02:41.180> have<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.480> installed

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that out um so I don't have it installed

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.010 
that out um so I don't have it installed
in<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.050> new<00:02:42.170> part<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.740> sown<00:02:43.040> unto<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.580> hair<00:02:43.790> um

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
my little beginners blending technique

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.350 
my little beginners blending technique
I'm<00:05:32.020> going<00:05:32.439> to<00:05:32.500> definitely<00:05:32.770> have<00:05:33.189> to<00:05:33.430> go<00:05:34.210> back

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
I'm going to definitely have to go back

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.719 
I'm going to definitely have to go back
and<00:05:34.590> hit<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.710> drawing<00:05:35.979> board<00:05:36.219> on<00:05:36.310> that<00:05:36.460> again

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
and hit the drawing board on that again

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.219 
and hit the drawing board on that again
because<00:05:36.879> I'm<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.180> really<00:05:37.330> fond<00:05:37.719> of<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.990> drug

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229

my<00:05:38.500> blending<00:05:39.159> technique<00:05:39.520> yet<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.729> think<00:05:40.000> I'm

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
my blending technique yet I think I'm

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.399 
my blending technique yet I think I'm
probably<00:05:40.210> going<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.569> do<00:05:40.659> a<00:05:40.689> braid<00:05:40.990> out<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.319> see

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
probably going to do a braid out and see

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:42.600 
probably going to do a braid out and see
how<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.560> works<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.039> i'll<00:05:42.159> do<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.310> video<00:05:42.490> on

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
how that works and i'll do a video on

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.700 
how that works and i'll do a video on
that<00:05:42.759> too<00:05:43.090> just<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.419> see<00:05:43.629> if<00:05:43.719> you<00:05:43.870> know<00:05:43.990> gives

anything to my head and I didn't want a

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.110 
anything to my head and I didn't want a
band<00:05:53.979> because<00:05:54.340> I<00:05:54.430> didn't<00:05:54.610> want<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:54.879> wind<00:05:55.060> to

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
blow and everybody to see that that was

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.640 
blow and everybody to see that that was
too<00:05:57.969> unnatural<00:05:58.360> for<00:05:58.810> what<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:58.990> wanted<00:05:59.319> to<00:05:59.500> go

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650

for i was going for a hundred percent
you<00:06:01.629> know<00:06:01.659> natural<00:06:02.169> look<00:06:02.319> and<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.530> really<00:06:02.830> think

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979
