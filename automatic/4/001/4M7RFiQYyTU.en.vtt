00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.080
 I want to tell you that the dragons of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.240
 fire and snow or ice also only 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 you can for version 1.8 if not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.980
 give you failures so nothing enjoy the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.780
 video and transition hello guys all 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 thanking the expected video tutorial 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.510
 how to get lava dragons and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.430
 ice the truth that this trick for 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 Version 1.8 is only sencillito 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 they need to do well the steps are three 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 steps and nothing guys I hope you like it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.910
 the video like by the intro and we're going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 start good guys the first step the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.030
 true that the only thing is very simple 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 what they are going to have to do is click 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 right of what would be the block of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 command but eye that I started there is no 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 command block because minecraft not what 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 leaves but it is very simple to obtain it 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 they are going to copy this command that is going to be 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.160
 down in the description that says name 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 minecraft command blog is what is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.520
 asking the minecraft here we are going to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.100
 erase what the name would be because you're going 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.989
 to put your name of minecraft and I 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.430
 another command appears block is very 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 little guys, so let's go 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.940
 start good once you've already got 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.720
 what would the command block give you 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 to click 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.970
 they're going to have to copy this van command 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 to have to copy the first page that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.260
 everything will be down in the description 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 are four pages we copy the first 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.480
 page we are going to give you here we are going to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.550
 done and once this is done we are going to 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.840
 give right click and it will restore 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 what it would be in dragons not but not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.830
 very fast because before there has to be 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 a command other commands and at the end they go 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.940
 to appear to throw the dragons 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.220
 obviously good here says click this is 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 what they want to remove what would be everything 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 this not all this dispenser this 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.320
 command we give you right arrangement and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.119
 but we do not want disappears 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 disappear because we want to get what 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.350
 that would be the dragons we will not leave 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 a little bit, I say that here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 It's fine because it can not interfere 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 it would be this structure that I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 to do so same step once 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.259
 have completed that we are going to click 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 straight 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.090
 again right click good and we're going to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.310
 copy the second page the command very 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.100
 simple control is this for here 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.619
 control in fact we grab a block of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 the restÃ³n and the second one is going to be generated 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.030
 construction I did not tell you they are 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 three constructions and at the end there is a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.780
 mini construction 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.910
 Once this is done, everything has come out 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.650
 well says defender install dragons pair 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.210
 3 fighter dragons the lava dragon no 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.880
 fire dragon let's go to another area 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.340
 because I do not trust there gave me a blue side 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.290
 I do not know why perfect because we're going to 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.140
 move away from that area and we will place the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.110
 very simple third command very simple 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.870
 we grab this let's copy control c 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.660
 this for each fact control in this 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.370
 case already had copied this will 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.530
 we give now right click and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.260
 perfect there is going to generate what 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.940
 It would be another construction and it has been in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.880
 account that says below facebook for insta 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.670
 10 parts rounds yesterday the dragons of 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 fire and where it was ice is not 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.930
 very simple we have what would be the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.730
 dragons and the last step guys no 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 let's leave a little more a little 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.620
 more right click the command you know 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 we go to the page that this for here 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.940
 perfect eye pages that can 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.390
 delay sometimes we do not go now 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.340
 control I know this minecraft control sees and 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.380
 we put the rest block not also 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 works with a button or a torch 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.220
 in this case I have put block very 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 simple good guys to repair what 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.730
 that it would be the fire dragon what they are going 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.520
 to need are five in green 10 for 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.710
 the place and a very simple game guys 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.340
 very simple so let's throw what 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.700
 that would be the one egg here we need 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.840
 five of nerves 1 2 3 4 5 and finally 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.150
 let's leave 10 variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.400
 8 9 and 10 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.959
 and with these guys I'm given the guidance of 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.730
 what would be wrong I think and we already have what 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.980
 that would be the dragon but beware that this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.000
 move this moves is very simple 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.580
 guys let's give it right click 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.130
 I said right click to the hard blanket and 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.780
 we are flying guys we are flying and 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.580
 a guys we are flying let's read 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.730
 right click what would be the hard ride 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.830
 not like I'm a pig not because this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.750
 technically it 's a flying pig so 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.120
 can fly what would be with the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.769
 dragons if they want to go down they go 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.750
 down if they want to go up it 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.480
 they go up and the dragon goes where 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.730
 you want the dragon is very very very 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.650
 but very beautiful and you can do 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.390
 thousands of dragons if they want to be another 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.340
 dragon let's see if we can do it 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:39.590
 well same step guys a dragon 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:44.360
 5 ender might 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 variables 1 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.160
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 eye and another appears 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.260
 I hope that I will not be overwhelmed 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.870
 true that the dragon is very cool very 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.820
 very cool pimp is all of neder and not 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.600
 I'm very hesitant so let's go for 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.510
 there 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.850
 chan chan chan chan both look I'm going to 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.600
 put this field of vision so that they see 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.100
 how is my mother my mother how is 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.500
 they stay as they stay they are all left 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.389
 crazy is like a flying snake is 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.860
 I could say and you can attack 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.080
 your friends can do a lot of 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.260
 things guys the rak I'm very happy 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.050
 with what would this be vanilla mod 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.750
 and you know it's not very simple and so 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.750
 let's make the snow dragon 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 we go down there you stay dragon there you 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.610
 you're fine, but let's see 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.400
 see to see we put here to our 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.930
 dragoncito right click and they got what 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.820
 who commanded eye 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.310
 and good boy to regenerate what 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.990
 it would be the dragon of snow and ice very 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.360
 simple they will grab what would be a 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.580
 sword because we're going to need it 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.770
 diamond sword and how can you see 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.680
 down here there are a lot of these bugs 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.389
 we just need some guys 11 because 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.630
 what we want to achieve is the ice core 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.330
 and these two mini mini monsters what 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.800
 they have so we're going to kill them no no 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.930
 it costs a lot does not take long and already 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.389
 we have this perfect let's remove 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.800
 this this here for here but ay 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.780
 wow what are you doing quiet that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.880
 this we do not need we just need 10 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.680
 this can duplicate what can 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.380
 duplicate look and see what they get 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.360
 would be 64 plus that's what it would be in 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.160
 creative not in survival and then if 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.650
 they want to make it legal to have that 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.039
 kill each one of my mother already and they are 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.410
 some pretty bunnies we go to the mess 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.210
 I'm going to put it up here and we're going to 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.220
 regenerate what would be the dragon very 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.050
 simple let's do the same but in 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.599
 this case we do not need the rod of 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.000
 blaze let's get the livescore well 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.410
 that we're going to throw the dragon egg and 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.050
 good guys once you get these 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.940
 three materials we will put here 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.229

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.259
 eye and is this before so good nothing 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:54.050
