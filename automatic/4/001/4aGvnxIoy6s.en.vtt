00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.780
 For if the truth is not very 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.450
 uncomfortable not personally only 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.820
 but at a psychic level the team did well 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.369
 things and I think many decisions 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.950
 in the field of judge 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.840
 they respect but they can not be like that because 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.109
 those ups and downs jefferson to be 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.199
 forward on the scoreboard and I do not know if 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.750
 you see it like that sinning in confidence in 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.780
 the retract and that comes over you 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.610
 from the rival team I think my teammates 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.920
 they have done a great job we have done a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 great job but there 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.150
 we will have to improve one or two things 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.159
 but the following is of decision to the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.830
 literal the first goal make us the goal 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.080
 lack of domination several failures 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.430
 blasted even in a mecca myself 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.830
 I say but if I myself have fallen and 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.330
 I'm seeing apologies but it's not for 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.339
 that you take me yellow because you are not 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.750
 can say anything because he talks to you 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.030
 Malaga not in the decisions of the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.400
 Referees always respect it I'm not 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.869
 who to discuss that but yes I 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.450
 it bothers a lot to miss a match 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 so for that decision because I'm very 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.719
 taste since Carlos arrived 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.719
 has talked a lot with me 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.420
 talked about we have a lot of confidence 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.100
 and with my colleagues they have helped me 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.869
 they keep I think you have to thank them 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.869
 to them that freedom that has given you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.640
 Carlos with the tastes is what you 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.899
 you mean the fact of having that freedom 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 within the playing field to move 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.340
 by all sectors besides that I 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 I think it's trust before I did not have 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 I was missing a lot because of reasons and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 Now I'm very comfortable but if I tell you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.600
 It hurts a lot to have lost a match 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 So I'm going to be honest, I'm 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 a guy that I first see for my team and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 well the secondary thing is that for me the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.099
 side are scoring table scoring goal 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.619
 What interests me is that my team 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.970
 my team is well and I think that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.159
 the next game we will go by 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.409
 they know it's a better year that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.200
 team a league favorite and you have to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 have a lot of respect 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.979
 thank you very much I know that we 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.890
 they are supporting us they will support us to death 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.260
 but before Saturday we have the ante 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 tigers and we hope to get results 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.889
 positive is very complicated is one what 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.490
 best team in the league I'll tell you again 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.120
 but 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.120
 we will go 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.350
 signature embraces the brand of champions
