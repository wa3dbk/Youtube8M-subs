00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
independent settings and now runs the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.040 
independent settings and now runs the
dual<00:05:44.040> coil<00:05:44.370> Pistons<00:05:44.910> which<00:05:45.510> results<00:05:45.960> in

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
dual coil Pistons which results in

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.410 
dual coil Pistons which results in
faster<00:05:46.290> response<00:05:46.920> times<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.430> greater<00:05:47.970> body

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
faster response times and greater body

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.990 
faster response times and greater body

item on the GDS and something that I

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.460 
item on the GDS and something that I
really<00:05:53.700> like<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.120> an<00:05:54.510> Australian<00:05:55.110> production

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
really like is an Australian production

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.900 
really like is an Australian production

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
it's called torque vectoring and it uses

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.600 
it's called torque vectoring and it uses

will<00:06:05.310> help<00:06:05.550> correct<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.270> so<00:06:06.930> there<00:06:07.110> you<00:06:07.230> have

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
will help correct it so there you have
