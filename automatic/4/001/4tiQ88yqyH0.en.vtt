00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.800 
made for his 400 meters we said hey
let's<00:01:52.310> take<00:01:52.490> everything<00:01:53.149> out<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.450> shoe

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
let's take everything out of that shoe

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.510 
let's take everything out of that shoe
and<00:01:53.960> only<00:01:54.439> put<00:01:54.649> in<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.860> things<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.219> Michael

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and only put in the things that Michael

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.999 
and only put in the things that Michael
needs<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.360> win<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.750> race<00:01:56.960> what<00:01:57.619> we<00:01:57.710> got<00:01:57.860> out

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
needs to win that race what we got out

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.620 
needs to win that race what we got out
of<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.159> was<00:01:58.490> not<00:01:58.820> only<00:01:59.000> making<00:01:59.119> an<00:01:59.299> athlete

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
of that was not only making an athlete

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.600 
of that was not only making an athlete
faster<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:00.560> actually<00:02:00.979> propelling<00:02:01.549> us

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
faster but actually propelling us

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.889 
faster but actually propelling us
forward<00:02:01.670> into<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> future<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.719> football

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
forward into the future of football

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.230 
forward into the future of football
Michael<00:02:03.560> Johnson<00:02:03.890> told<00:02:04.100> us<00:02:04.310> hey<00:02:04.460> let's<00:02:04.939> focus

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
Michael Johnson told us hey let's focus

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.399 
Michael Johnson told us hey let's focus
on<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.600> zero<00:02:05.930> step

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
on the zero step

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.590 
on the zero step
let's<00:02:06.710> get<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.130> ignition<00:02:07.310> off<00:02:07.969> of<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.360> line

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
let's get that ignition off of the line

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.999 
let's get that ignition off of the line
and<00:02:08.869> make<00:02:09.020> sure<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> athletes<00:02:09.740> not

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and make sure that the athletes not

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.220 
and make sure that the athletes not
slipping<00:02:10.490> at<00:02:10.580> all<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.150> zero<00:02:11.480> step<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:12.050> where

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
slipping at all the zero step is where

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470 
slipping at all the zero step is where
we've<00:02:12.350> identified<00:02:12.700> certain<00:02:13.700> techniques<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
we've identified certain techniques that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.180 
we've identified certain techniques that
the<00:02:14.900> best<00:02:15.080> use<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> blocks

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the best use to get out of the blocks

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.230 
the best use to get out of the blocks

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the vapor laser talent project

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150 
the vapor laser talent project
was<00:02:18.570> specifically<00:02:19.320> around<00:02:19.590> designing<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
was specifically around designing a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160 
was specifically around designing a
cleat<00:02:20.490> for<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> four-year<00:02:21.180> dash<00:02:21.570> for

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
cleat for the four-year dash for

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.200 
cleat for the four-year dash for
athletes<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.680> run<00:02:22.830> their<00:02:22.950> fastest<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.880> stance

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
athletes to run their fastest the stance

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.790 
athletes to run their fastest the stance
that<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.570> put<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.170> starts<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> take

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
that you put them in starts to take

that you put them in starts to take
effect<00:02:25.830> before<00:02:26.520> you've<00:02:26.640> ever<00:02:26.850> even<00:02:27.060> moved<00:02:27.420> up

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
effect before you've ever even moved up

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.540

the<00:02:27.780> starting<00:02:28.140> line<00:02:28.290> when<00:02:28.860> our<00:02:28.950> team<00:02:29.130> focused

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the starting line when our team focused

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.180 
the starting line when our team focused
in<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.210> zero<00:02:30.450> step<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.410> found<00:02:31.710> minor

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
in on the zero step we found minor

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830 
in on the zero step we found minor
slipping<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.880> was<00:02:32.970> occurring<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.510> every

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
slipping that was occurring at every

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.960 
slipping that was occurring at every
single<00:02:34.050> step<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:35.040> our<00:02:35.160> big<00:02:35.460> aha

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
single step and that was our big aha

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
single step and that was our big aha
moment<00:02:36.360> how<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.840> translates<00:02:37.440> into<00:02:37.740> product

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
moment how that translates into product

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
moment how that translates into product
is<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.820> improve<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.480> geometry<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> cleat

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
is to improve the geometry of the cleat

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.380 
is to improve the geometry of the cleat
and<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.010> plate<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.610> shoe<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.090> that's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and the plate of the shoe and that's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300 
and the plate of the shoe and that's
where<00:02:42.600> 3d<00:02:42.870> printing<00:02:43.200> comes<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> using

where 3d printing comes in using

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.340 
where 3d printing comes in using
traditional<00:02:44.520> prototyping<00:02:45.480> methods<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:46.080> might

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
traditional prototyping methods it might

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.320 
traditional prototyping methods it might
have<00:02:46.470> taken<00:02:46.620> us<00:02:46.860> years<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.610> translate<00:02:48.120> these

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
have taken us years to translate these

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.660 
have taken us years to translate these
learnings<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.500> an<00:02:49.590> actual<00:02:49.830> cleat<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.610> the

and everybody wants to know where the
same<00:03:16.080> shoes<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.040> how<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.400> translate<00:03:17.850> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180
