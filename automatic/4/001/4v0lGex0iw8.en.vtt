very fast ball batter going for the
hookshot<00:00:25.179> there<00:00:25.630> was<00:00:25.750> obviously<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.590> little

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
hookshot there was obviously a little

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.970

if<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.189> replay<00:00:30.550> tells<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.970> story<00:00:31.210> would<00:00:31.989> be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
if the replay tells the story would be

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.020 
if the replay tells the story would be
interesting<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.649> see<00:00:32.860> exactly<00:00:33.280> what<00:00:33.820> height

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
interesting to see exactly what height

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.350 
interesting to see exactly what height
the<00:00:34.210> ball<00:00:34.239> went<00:00:34.570> through<00:00:34.629> like<00:00:35.140> my<00:00:35.320> purchase

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the ball went through like my purchase

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.579 
the ball went through like my purchase
but<00:00:37.360> interested<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:37.930> see<00:00:38.079> what<00:00:38.260> height<00:00:38.409> that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
but interested to see what height that

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:45.060 
but interested to see what height that
ball<00:00:38.800> went<00:00:39.010> through

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.860 

it's<00:00:46.070> interesting<00:00:46.340> why<00:00:46.700> nice<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.090> suppose<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
it's interesting why nice I suppose the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.840 
it's interesting why nice I suppose the
question<00:00:48.200> one<00:00:48.530> would<00:00:48.650> ask<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:49.130> when<00:00:49.550> he<00:00:49.640> hit<00:00:49.820> it

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
question one would ask is when he hit it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.920 
question one would ask is when he hit it
was<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.420> shoulder<00:00:50.870> height<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.600> if<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.720> had

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
was it shoulder height and if it had

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.480 
was it shoulder height and if it had
continued<00:00:54.350> its<00:00:54.470> path<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.040> just<00:00:55.280> looking

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
continued its path but just looking

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.560 
continued its path but just looking
there<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.820> probably<00:00:56.060> would<00:00:56.150> have<00:00:56.180> been<00:00:56.270> above

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
there it probably would have been above

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.480 
there it probably would have been above
the<00:00:56.690> shoulder<00:00:56.990> height<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.350> really<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.830> little

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
the shoulder height so really a little

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.160 
the shoulder height so really a little
bit<00:00:58.610> unlucky<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:59.060> think<00:00:59.300> is<00:00:59.360> probably<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.690> way

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
bit unlucky I think is probably the way

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.140 
bit unlucky I think is probably the way
to<00:01:00.230> describe<00:01:00.620> that<00:01:00.830> dismissal<00:01:01.010> 14<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.820> 26

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150

Kearney<00:02:48.190> was<00:02:48.220> right<00:02:48.520> it's<00:02:48.819> nothing<00:02:49.030> wrong

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
Kearney was right it's nothing wrong

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.570 
Kearney was right it's nothing wrong
with<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.330> bat<00:02:49.569> it's<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:50.140> with<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> handle<00:02:51.220> in

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
with a bat it's just with a handle in

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.780

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
fact a spliced into the bat I think

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.729 
fact a spliced into the bat I think
that's<00:02:55.060> off<00:02:55.239> often<00:02:55.690> happens<00:02:55.989> with<00:02:56.200> quick

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
that's off often happens with quick

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.580 
that's off often happens with quick
bowlers<00:02:57.130> like<00:02:57.370> show<00:02:57.760> your<00:02:57.850> back<00:02:58.030> toe<00:02:58.269> they<00:02:58.590> do

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
bowlers like show your back toe they do

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.140 
bowlers like show your back toe they do
get<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.920> handle<00:03:02.040> away<00:03:03.040> from<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> bat<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.880> I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
get the handle away from the bat and I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.400 
get the handle away from the bat and I
think<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.540> was<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.930> pace<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.319> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
think that was just the pace of the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.559 
think that was just the pace of the
delivery<00:03:05.739> early<00:03:06.069> on<00:03:06.220> maybe<00:03:06.430> eating<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:07.390> bat

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
delivery early on maybe eating the bat

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.280 
delivery early on maybe eating the bat
quite<00:03:07.840> low

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
quite low

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.100 
quite low
early<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:11.580> explain<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.940> us<00:03:13.090> well<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.050> think

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
early on explain this to us well I think

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.009 
early on explain this to us well I think
