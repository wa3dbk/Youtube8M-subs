00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that will work I honestly don't have a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
that will work I honestly don't have a
clue<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> clips<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.039> competitive<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
clue in the clips of competitive that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
clue in the clips of competitive that
we've<00:00:47.820> seen<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.480> saw<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:48.989> type<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
we've seen we saw a game type and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
we've seen we saw a game type and
countdown<00:00:49.980> timer<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> match<00:00:50.820> making<00:00:51.449> me

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
countdown timer for the match making me

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.910 
countdown timer for the match making me
think<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.050> happening<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.680> some

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
think it was happening in some

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
think it was happening in some
controlled<00:00:53.399> environment<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> makes<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
controlled environment but this makes it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
controlled environment but this makes it
sound<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.350> competitive<00:00:55.829> multiplayer<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sound like competitive multiplayer is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
sound like competitive multiplayer is
set<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.850> areas<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> world<00:00:57.840> now

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
set in areas out in the world now

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.900 
set in areas out in the world now
they've<00:00:58.710> said<00:00:58.949> time<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.460> again<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
they've said time and time again that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
they've said time and time again that
PvP<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.719> choice<00:01:01.079> you'll<00:01:01.469> never<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.829> forced

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
PvP is a choice you'll never be forced

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
PvP is a choice you'll never be forced
to<00:01:02.399> play<00:01:02.520> competitive<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> won't<00:01:03.960> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to play competitive so you won't just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
to play competitive so you won't just
get<00:01:04.229> shot<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> player<00:01:05.010> whilst<00:01:05.339> exploring

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
get shot by a player whilst exploring

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
get shot by a player whilst exploring
the<00:01:05.850> world<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.720> imagine<00:01:07.170> it'll<00:01:07.350> let<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the world but I imagine it'll let you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
the world but I imagine it'll let you
know<00:01:07.830> you're<00:01:08.040> entering<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.460> PvP<00:01:08.939> zone<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.510> give

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
know you're entering a PvP zone and give

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.719 
know you're entering a PvP zone and give
you<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.200> away<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:11.040> perhaps<00:01:11.280> there's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you time to turn away or perhaps there's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
you time to turn away or perhaps there's
some<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> even<00:01:12.659> though<00:01:12.750> competitive

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
some way that even though competitive

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
some way that even though competitive
multiplayer<00:01:13.409> takes<00:01:14.100> place<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.670> areas<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
multiplayer takes place out in areas of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
multiplayer takes place out in areas of
the<00:01:15.390> world<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.900> still<00:01:16.350> plays<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> more

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the world it still plays out in a more

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
the world it still plays out in a more
controlled<00:01:17.250> environment<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:18.420> instance

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659

matches<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> join<00:01:19.770> honestly<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
matches you have to join honestly I have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
matches you have to join honestly I have
no<00:01:21.240> idea<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.869> certainly<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.350> curious

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
no idea but I'm certainly very curious

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
no idea but I'm certainly very curious
about<00:01:23.280> how<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> works<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> main

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
about how it works so that was the main

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
about how it works so that was the main
thing<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.920> felt<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:26.549> big<00:01:26.759> deal

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
thing which I felt was a pretty big deal

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
thing which I felt was a pretty big deal
because<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.450> previously<00:01:28.259> guessed<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
because I previously guessed the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
because I previously guessed the
competitive<00:01:29.250> multiplayer<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.270> place

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
competitive multiplayer might take place

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
competitive multiplayer might take place
like<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.049> arena<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.560> something<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like in an arena or something in the

like in an arena or something in the
city<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> world<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:34.020> were<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
city not out in the world there were a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
city not out in the world there were a
few<00:01:34.380> other<00:01:34.530> interesting<00:01:34.979> things<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
few other interesting things in the
interview<00:01:35.820> though<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.720> being

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
interview though the first one being

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
interview though the first one being
that<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:37.259> confirmed<00:01:37.680> double<00:01:38.130> jump<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that he confirmed double jump as a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
that he confirmed double jump as a
hunter<00:01:39.000> ability<00:01:39.420> we've<00:01:39.960> seen<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.290> examples

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
hunter ability we've seen some examples

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140 
hunter ability we've seen some examples
of<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> past<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.939> worth

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of this in the past but it's worth

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.030 
of this in the past but it's worth
noting<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.750> also<00:01:43.140> makes<00:01:43.409> sense<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
noting it also makes sense as the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
noting it also makes sense as the
Warlocks<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.670> already<00:01:44.850> glide<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.210> magic

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Warlocks can already glide with magic

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480 
Warlocks can already glide with magic
and<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> Titan<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.920> too<00:01:47.070> heavy<00:01:47.220> for

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and the Titan would be too heavy for

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
and the Titan would be too heavy for
double<00:01:47.729> jumps<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.390> fits<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> hunter<00:01:48.930> well

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
double jumps so it fits the hunter well

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
double jumps so it fits the hunter well
next<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.130> talks<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> three<00:01:50.880> weapon

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
next he talks about the three weapon

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.819 
next he talks about the three weapon
system<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> how<00:01:51.780> weapons<00:01:52.170> swapping<00:01:52.590> works

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
system and how weapons swapping works

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
system and how weapons swapping works
basically<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> switch<00:01:54.180> between<00:01:54.360> your

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
basically you switch between your

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
basically you switch between your
primary<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> special<00:01:55.920> by<00:01:56.070> tapping<00:01:56.490> triangle

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
primary and special by tapping triangle

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
primary and special by tapping triangle
or<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.290> heavy<00:01:58.469> weapon<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
or why and to get your heavy weapon you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
or why and to get your heavy weapon you
hold<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.719> personally<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
hold it down personally I think that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959 
hold it down personally I think that
sounds<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:02.009> fluid<00:02:02.369> system<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
sounds like a really nice fluid system I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.090 
sounds like a really nice fluid system I
like<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> after<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.200> he<00:02:04.439> made<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> sound<00:02:04.950> like

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
like it after that he made it sound like

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
like it after that he made it sound like
special<00:02:05.610> abilities<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.390> tweaked<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
special abilities can be tweaked and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
special abilities can be tweaked and
changed<00:02:07.740> along<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.580> armor<00:02:08.910> weapons

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
changed along with your armor weapons

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.390 
changed along with your armor weapons
and<00:02:09.539> character<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.410> wouldn't<00:02:11.039> take<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.190> as

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and character I wouldn't take it as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.210 
and character I wouldn't take it as
confirmation<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:12.270> he<00:02:12.420> wasn't<00:02:12.720> completely

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
confirmation as he wasn't completely

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.920 
confirmation as he wasn't completely
clear<00:02:13.520> but<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.090> sounded<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:14.750> what<00:02:14.870> he

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
clear but it sounded like that's what he

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.080 
clear but it sounded like that's what he
