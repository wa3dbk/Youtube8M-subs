00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
one this is the 29 inch long when I

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.709 
one this is the 29 inch long when I

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
think the other one is 32 inches just I

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.389 
think the other one is 32 inches just I
like<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.229> because<00:01:11.409> it's<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.740> little<00:01:11.979> bit<00:01:12.219> more

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
like this because it's a little bit more

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.679 
like this because it's a little bit more
handy<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:14.590> for<00:01:14.920> perhaps<00:01:15.729> working<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.479> those

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
handy more for perhaps working in those

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.480 
handy more for perhaps working in those
should<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.079> say<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:19.079> another<00:01:20.079> lovely<00:01:20.649> piece

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
should we say and another lovely piece

drilling some lanyard holes and I was

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.200 
drilling some lanyard holes and I was
thinking<00:05:43.400> as<00:05:43.490> well<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:44.060> modify<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:44.680> pop<00:05:45.680> on<00:05:46.210> a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
thinking as well to modify this pop on a

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.110 
thinking as well to modify this pop on a
piece<00:05:47.690> of<00:05:48.159> wood<00:05:49.159> you<00:05:49.190> put<00:05:49.400> it<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.550> a<00:05:49.610> tube<00:05:49.849> from

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
piece of wood you put it in a tube from

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.100 
piece of wood you put it in a tube from
a<00:05:50.840> bicycle<00:05:51.440> tire<00:05:51.940> something<00:05:52.940> like<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.360> that

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
a bicycle tire something like that that

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.200 
a bicycle tire something like that that
would<00:05:54.229> just<00:05:54.409> add<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.650> little<00:05:55.190> bit<00:05:55.310> more<00:05:55.669> grip

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
would just add that little bit more grip

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.190 
would just add that little bit more grip
to<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.479> see<00:05:57.050> it's<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.770> little<00:05:58.010> bit<00:05:58.190> slick<00:05:59.200> but

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
to it see it's a little bit slick but

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.610 
to it see it's a little bit slick but
when<00:06:00.979> you've<00:06:01.099> got<00:06:01.130> there<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:03.110> pommel<00:06:03.440> end

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
when you've got there and the pommel end

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.680 
when you've got there and the pommel end
that<00:06:04.550> stops<00:06:04.789> your<00:06:04.880> hand<00:06:05.060> from<00:06:05.180> sliding<00:06:05.450> off

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
that stops your hand from sliding off

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.899 
that stops your hand from sliding off
and<00:06:05.930> obviously<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:07.070> baseball<00:06:07.460> bat

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
and obviously the baseball bat

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.610 
and obviously the baseball bat
absolutely<00:06:08.570> fantastic<00:06:08.719> that<00:06:09.260> doesn't<00:06:09.530> go

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
absolutely fantastic that doesn't go

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.290 
absolutely fantastic that doesn't go
anywhere<00:06:09.760> but<00:06:10.760> you<00:06:10.849> could<00:06:11.000> quite<00:06:11.270> easily

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
anywhere but you could quite easily

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.839 
anywhere but you could quite easily
modify<00:06:12.080> these<00:06:12.370> both<00:06:13.370> of<00:06:13.520> them<00:06:13.610> could<00:06:13.789> be

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
modify these both of them could be

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.050 
modify these both of them could be
material<00:06:14.389> for<00:06:14.810> days<00:06:15.430> so<00:06:16.430> if<00:06:16.610> you're<00:06:16.760> looking
