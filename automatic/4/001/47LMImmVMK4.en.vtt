 both okrug 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.440
 such 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.570
 this question 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.649
 by the way 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.779
 when choosing 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.369
 x 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.369
 job markets 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.029
 some others 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.019
 so now half a year 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.709
 in arkhangelsk such bow 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.520
 x 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 attracting 4 x 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.140
 but 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 e however 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 it is x 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.690
 people 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 ha ha 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.260
 not 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.230
 first stage of the project 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.220
 this project 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 corr 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.530
 l 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 6 cm a.c 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.229
 when is the turnover 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 square 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 at 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.680
 to 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.400
 the code grows 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 at one o'clock 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.410
