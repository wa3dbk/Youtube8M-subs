00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
right now I'm shooting regularly for

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
right now I'm shooting regularly for
some<00:01:49.409> reason<00:01:49.770> after<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.130> reload<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.970> shooting

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
some reason after I reload I'm shooting

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
some reason after I reload I'm shooting
regular<00:01:51.780> again<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.530> watch<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.040> happens

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.520 
regular again now watch what happens
after<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> reload<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> time<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> suddenly

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
after I reload this time and suddenly

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
after I reload this time and suddenly
I'm<00:01:55.799> shooting<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.399> crazy<00:01:56.790> amount<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
I'm shooting these crazy amount of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
I'm shooting these crazy amount of
bullets<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> are<00:01:57.719> ricocheting<00:01:58.229> off

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
bullets that are ricocheting off

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
bullets that are ricocheting off
surfaces<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.790> see<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.149> least<00:02:00.329> twice

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
surfaces as I can see at least twice

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.660 
surfaces as I can see at least twice
before<00:02:01.320> stopping<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.040> suddenly<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
before stopping and then suddenly it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
before stopping and then suddenly it
just<00:02:03.180> stops<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.990> what's<00:02:04.170> causing

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
just stops I don't know what's causing

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
just stops I don't know what's causing
this<00:02:04.729> there's<00:02:05.729> no<00:02:06.000> information<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.689> the

in this video is going off my

in this video is going off my
experimentation

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

experimentation
alone<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.210> because<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> reload

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
alone and it's not because of the reload

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.410 
alone and it's not because of the reload
I<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.920> looking<00:02:17.100> like<00:02:17.430> after<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> reload

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
I know it's looking like after I reload

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.510 
I know it's looking like after I reload
suddenly<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.770> chance<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
suddenly there's a little chance that it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.220 
suddenly there's a little chance that it
can<00:02:20.670> go<00:02:20.790> into<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.180> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.480> enrage<00:02:21.930> phase

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
can go into this kind of enrage phase

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
can go into this kind of enrage phase
this<00:02:22.470> gun<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.880> reload<00:02:24.240> because

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
this gun but it's not the reload because

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.240 
this gun but it's not the reload because
I've<00:02:24.630> tested<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.050> out<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.500> sometimes<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I've tested this out and sometimes it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.430 
I've tested this out and sometimes it
just<00:02:26.430> randomly<00:02:26.910> happens<00:02:27.390> there's<00:02:27.930> probably

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
just randomly happens there's probably

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.320 
just randomly happens there's probably
something<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.100> causes<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.790> weapon<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> go

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
something that causes this weapon to go

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
something that causes this weapon to go
into<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.990> weird<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.590> rage<00:02:31.890> phase

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
into that like weird and rage phase

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.740 
into that like weird and rage phase
where<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.520> starts<00:02:32.760> shooting<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.240> fast<00:02:33.450> but

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
where it starts shooting really fast but

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.110 
where it starts shooting really fast but
I<00:02:33.960> honestly<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.950> no<00:02:35.070> idea<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I honestly have no idea but when you do

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.790 
I honestly have no idea but when you do
get<00:02:36.390> into<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.900> rage<00:02:37.110> phase<00:02:37.380> with<00:02:37.680> this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
get into that in rage phase with this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440 
get into that in rage phase with this
gun<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.550> don't<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.760> why<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> keep<00:02:39.120> calling

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
gun and I don't know why I keep calling

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
gun and I don't know why I keep calling
it<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.630> I'm<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:40.020> I'm<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.710> making<00:02:41.550> up

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
it that I'm just I'm just making up

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.300 
it that I'm just I'm just making up
names<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:43.020> saying<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.710> once<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> do

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
names but as I was saying it once you do

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.150 
names but as I was saying it once you do
get<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.850> crazy<00:02:45.570> mode<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> gun<00:02:46.830> it's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
get into that crazy mode of the gun it's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.490 
get into that crazy mode of the gun it's
it<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.670> does<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> lot<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.810> damage<00:02:49.050> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
it really does a lot of damage to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.140 
it really does a lot of damage to
enemies<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:49.980> way<00:02:50.160> more<00:02:50.190> damage<00:02:50.670> than<00:02:50.790> before

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
enemies like way more damage than before

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.790 
enemies like way more damage than before
and<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:51.990> pretty<00:02:52.260> much<00:02:52.350> how<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.680> work

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
and that's pretty much how that work

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.340 
and that's pretty much how that work
works<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:54.270> strange<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.810> don't<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:55.050> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
works it's really strange I don't know I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.990 
works it's really strange I don't know I
don't<00:02:55.860> know<00:02:55.920> why<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.130> does<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.550> something

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
don't know why it does that something

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
don't know why it does that something
causes<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.690> don't<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.140> yet<00:02:58.350> anyways<00:02:58.890> when

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
causes it I don't know yet anyways when

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.010 
causes it I don't know yet anyways when
the<00:02:59.190> orc<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.610> not<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.240> crazy<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.810> rage

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the orc is not in it's crazy and rage

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.140 
the orc is not in it's crazy and rage
phase<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.950> pretty<00:03:02.370> normal<00:03:02.730> bandit

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
phase it's just a pretty normal bandit

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
phase it's just a pretty normal bandit
SMG<00:03:03.630> weapon<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.920> incendiary

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
SMG weapon I do have the incendiary

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.400 
SMG weapon I do have the incendiary
version<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.810> sure<00:03:07.020> if<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> comes

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
version for it I'm not sure if it comes

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.900 
version for it I'm not sure if it comes
in<00:03:07.560> other<00:03:07.620> elements<00:03:08.100> I'm<00:03:08.190> assuming<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
in other elements I'm assuming that it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.670 
in other elements I'm assuming that it
probably<00:03:09.390> does<00:03:09.600> because<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.020> do<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> fire

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
probably does because I do have the fire

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.830 
probably does because I do have the fire
fire<00:03:10.980> prefix<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.610> once<00:03:12.270> again<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.480> can't<00:03:12.690> say

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
fire prefix but once again I can't say

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.910 
fire prefix but once again I can't say
for<00:03:12.870> sure<00:03:13.020> because<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.530> haven't<00:03:13.560> gotten

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
for sure because I haven't gotten
