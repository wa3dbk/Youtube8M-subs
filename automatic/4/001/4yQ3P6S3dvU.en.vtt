here is a picture of the scale that
we're<00:00:59.940> doing<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> minor<00:01:00.660> pentatonic<00:01:00.960> feel<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
we're doing a minor pentatonic feel so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
we're doing a minor pentatonic feel so
you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.129> threat<00:01:02.460> seventh<00:01:03.379> basically

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you can see how threat seventh basically

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.289 
out of ten so that's the definition of E
minor<00:01:23.130> pentatonic<00:01:23.490> scale<00:01:26.060> here's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.150> good

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
minor pentatonic scale here's a good

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
minor pentatonic scale here's a good
exercise<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.590> can

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
exercise that's how to do it and we can

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.830 
exercise that's how to do it and we can
play<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.250> along<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.509> we're

gonna play it up from from the low

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
gonna play it up from from the low
strings<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> top<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.140> come<00:01:34.320> back

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
strings to top and when we come back

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.719 
strings to top and when we come back
down<00:01:34.619> we're<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> come<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.310> and

down we're going to come back down and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
down we're going to come back down and
kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> sets<00:01:36.799> sets<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.920> three<00:01:38.130> strings

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
kind of sets sets of three strings

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:54.970 
kind of sets sets of three strings
you'll<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> mean

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.080 

let's<00:01:55.980> give<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.460> much<00:01:56.580> practice<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
let's give you as much practice as

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.210 
let's give you as much practice as
possible<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.260> quit<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> down

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
possible so you can quit up and down

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.390 
possible so you can quit up and down
like<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.650> really<00:02:01.980> comfortable

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
like that just get really comfortable

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.210 
like that just get really comfortable
with<00:02:02.760> having<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.360> under<00:02:04.260> your<00:02:04.290> fingers<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
with having this under your fingers so

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.359 
with having this under your fingers so
to<00:02:05.280> speak<00:02:06.470> then<00:02:07.470> you'll<00:02:07.620> be<00:02:07.740> able<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.070> use<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to speak then you'll be able to use it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.690 
to speak then you'll be able to use it
to<00:02:08.399> improvise<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:16.740> could<00:02:16.950> also<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> good

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to improvise this could also be a good

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:50.600 
to improvise this could also be a good
warm-up<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> what<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.700> improvising<00:02:49.610> but

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
warm-up so what is improvising but

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.010 
warm-up so what is improvising but
knowing<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.360> know<00:02:51.630> where<00:02:51.870> those

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
knowing you have to know where those

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.640 
knowing you have to know where those
dots<00:02:52.350> are<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.160> refer<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> your<00:02:53.880> chart

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
dots are you have to refer to your chart

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.690 
dots are you have to refer to your chart
before<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.920> memorize<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.489> once<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
before you memorize it and once you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.130 
before you memorize it and once you
memorize<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:57.630> about<00:02:57.750> where<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
memorize it just think about where the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.259 
memorize it just think about where the
dots<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.010> try<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.519> kind<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> hit<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
dots are and try to just kind of hit the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.620 
dots are and try to just kind of hit the
notes<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:01.440> dots<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:02.459> any<00:03:02.820> any<00:03:03.120> pattern

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
notes on these dots in any any pattern

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:21.170 
notes on these dots in any any pattern
you<00:03:03.720> want<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.590> any<00:03:19.820> play<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> again<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
you want you know any play it again a
