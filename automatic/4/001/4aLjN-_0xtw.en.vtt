00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
path to being in every down back he can

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.030 
path to being in every down back he can
catch<00:03:38.720> really<00:03:38.959> well<00:03:39.170> he<00:03:39.349> can<00:03:39.470> pass<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.859> tech

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.860 
catch really well he can pass the tech
and<00:03:40.220> he's<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> monster<00:03:40.819> he's<00:03:41.150> not<00:03:41.389> gonna<00:03:41.599> if

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870

Diego<00:07:13.889> I<00:07:14.580> think<00:07:15.060> he<00:07:15.210> really<00:07:15.570> kind<00:07:15.720> of<00:07:15.810> takes

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
Diego I think he really kind of takes

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.960 
Diego I think he really kind of takes
over<00:07:16.260> what's<00:07:16.590> pros<00:07:16.979> was<00:07:17.280> to<00:07:17.490> them<00:07:17.639> a<00:07:17.669> few<00:07:17.940> years

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
over what's pros was to them a few years

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.300 
over what's pros was to them a few years
ago<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:19.020> I<00:07:19.110> think<00:07:19.320> he<00:07:19.440> has<00:07:19.590> similar<00:07:19.979> value

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
ago and I think he has similar value

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.740 
ago and I think he has similar value
with<00:07:20.430> what<00:07:20.639> he<00:07:20.700> did<00:07:20.880> in<00:07:21.000> New<00:07:21.030> England<00:07:21.539> and<00:07:21.690> I

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
with what he did in New England and I

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.180 
with what he did in New England and I
think<00:07:21.990> they're<00:07:22.110> gonna<00:07:22.229> really<00:07:22.470> utilize<00:07:22.950> them

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
think they're gonna really utilize them

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.890 
think they're gonna really utilize them
and<00:07:23.310> find<00:07:23.910> creative<00:07:24.330> ways<00:07:24.360> to<00:07:24.510> get<00:07:24.780> him

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
and find creative ways to get him
