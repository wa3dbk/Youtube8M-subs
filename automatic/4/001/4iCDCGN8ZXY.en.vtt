00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
high-end lofts tough did for sims 3

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
high-end lofts tough did for sims 3
where<00:00:52.350> there's<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.860> aquarium<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910

heart bed and electric guitar that would

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
heart bed and electric guitar that would
actually<00:00:56.489> slightly<00:00:56.910> justify<00:00:57.570> stuff<00:00:57.870> packs<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

actually slightly justify stuff packs it
I<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.500> hope<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> becomes<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> rule

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I just hope that becomes the rule

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
I just hope that becomes the rule
instead<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.199> exception<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.390> yeah<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
instead of the exception and yeah my

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
instead of the exception and yeah my
pans<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.680> haven't<00:01:05.010> changed<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
pans really haven't changed from the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.380 
pans really haven't changed from the
last<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.590> yeah<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.880> end<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.119> being

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
last video so yeah if they end up being

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170 
last video so yeah if they end up being
twenty<00:01:09.689> dollars<00:01:10.020> again<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.680> might<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.580> get

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
twenty dollars again I might just get

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.260 
twenty dollars again I might just get
like<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
like one or two because right now it's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
like one or two because right now it's
kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.930> slim<00:01:16.170> pickings<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.860> terms<00:01:17.070> of

kind of slim pickings in terms of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.969 
kind of slim pickings in terms of
official<00:01:17.820> content<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.659> later<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.439> then

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
official content but then later on then

will be pretty much useless to me so
I'll<00:01:24.270> probably<00:01:24.570> skip<00:01:24.990> those<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.770> yeah

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I'll probably skip those because yeah

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.920 
I'll probably skip those because yeah
