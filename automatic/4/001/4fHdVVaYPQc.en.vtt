00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.000
 and fall or girlfriends and friends in this 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.560
 I bring you a video tutorial that 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 I had asked a couple of people 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.550
 on how to play the call of duty 4 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.550
 multiplayer and once they have it 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.320
 installed good we know that this call of 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.869
 duty is very good I have it in my 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.819
 channel some other video because 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.859
 can see a tutorial and here I have 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:24.009
 some other callplay gameplay 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.359
 duty and good some other good tutorial 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.489
 well worth noting that I now 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.589
 I will teach, I will simply tell you the steps 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.020
 exactly how they have to do it already 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.960
 that I already have it completely full 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.670
 multiplayer I have not been able to 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.340
 get the cid and since I had it 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.320
 installed I decided it's nothing of viktor 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.810
 orbÃ¡n not anything like that I had it in a 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 cid and that I proposed a friend and good 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.430
 I got in the files that are 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.280
 needed to be able to play 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 multiplayer these files are not from my 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 I just found it 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 and I wanted to do this tutorial for 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.260
 that people are easier to work 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.910
 to find the files in a single 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 place and do not go through the surfing 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 not find them anything 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.460
 so good they'll go to the link that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 I will leave you in the description of this 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 video and it will take you to this file 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.110
 remove the multiplayer duty ok so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 call the file and it should be noted that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 these files that come here within 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 ferrari are not at all my responsibility 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 no good weighs 380 and 1.09 megabytes that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 is what will take them approximately 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.530
 a half hour of download depends on the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.900
 speed of your internet no and well yo 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.450
 I no longer download it, although it's good for 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 see they have no problem no no 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.320
 I think it marks them as a virus, not like that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.740
 what good did he cancel 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.650
 and good to leave you this this error of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.440
 I already told you what happened 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.229
 to the desk do it as it is already and what 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.930
 they extract here enter in the password 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.930
 the password is cristian 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.070
 are 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
 okay 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 and good to decompress some 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.830
 that other rare other files apart from 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.290
 that ok 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.620
 well let's leave us four 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.750
 Rare apart from this leaves us the call of 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.340
 duty four drums three bombs ter and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.680
 know that it is very necessary to be able to 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.960
 play it ok after this we leave it here 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.660
 ok well these four files are the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 indispensable is good for what 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.720
 the broth of 4.23 serves them we know that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.120
 previously we had to patch what 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 practically from the program of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 hype this was the useful heat but this 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 we can not find it in the hype esther 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.640
 why because I put this no longer lends 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.440
 your services to activision so good 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.860
 we can no longer do this simply 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.190
 I leave this folder here is the one 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 they need to stick in the on their as they are 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.310
 I say in your installation folder 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.709
 call of duty 4 ok that says pepe then 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.500
 you unpack this and take it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.600
 this folder here ok then you what 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.030
 what they have to do is control is done 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.820
 this folder here and go where 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.910
 have your call of duty 4 installed here 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.970
 and here I have also the black ops 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 pd and erase the folder but not the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.660
 deleted because I already have it then 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.610
 I think you listen very well this I want 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.750
 that they do the same steps delete it and 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.550
 they stick it and stick it to the disk 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.510
 in this folder here and paste the one that is 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.710
 here in this folder here ok they replace it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.050
 they practically have to erase it and 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.580
 paste it and very well once you have done 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.890
 that's already in the hype esther 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.210
 you could completely say the folder 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.880
 updated so they do not have any 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.240
 problem when entering a good server 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.650
 then this here already outside 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.240
 then we have two patches these 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.330
 parts are necessary for the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.100
 servers us practically leave us 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.730
 enter there then what are we going to do 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.730
 extract here 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.069
 unzip them I'm here too and 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.069
 extract here 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.739
 until careful yes yes what matters 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.750
 I'll leave these two files here 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.700
 they have to execute it like 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.410
 administrator each one I do not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.209
 because because when I try 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.889
 it's just going to take me a while to open it and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.290
 is going to tell me that I already have it installed 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.350
 so they have to execute what 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.050
 it will depend and it does not matter the order in which 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.520
 install it ok either it is here or it is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.440
 here I installed it first no matter with 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.660
 so that they install both very well a 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.410
 Once you have that there, practically 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.690
 already do that they have already replaced the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.820
 pont booster folder in your folder 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.430
 of installation and have installed these 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.229
 two these two parts practically already 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.200
 they will be able to enter sugar safely 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.690
 abdul team multiplayer the 4 obviously to 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.550
 play without any problem but when 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.080
 are inside the game maybe dress a 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.000
 error when it enters a server 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.700
 so this is what this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.140
 folder here 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.490
 well it depends happens to me at the beginning 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.680
 from when I first started playing what 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.340
 a server came in and I went out with 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.110
 bots fx mp efe is different from the 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.850
 server means that the file is 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.070
 different from the server then 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.570
 It depends on the error I threw when he 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.540
 want to enter a server either 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.310
 local and set code post that fx or mp 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.100
 anyone have to simply 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.620
 copy it go to your folder 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.620
 installation of the call of duty 4 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.710
 enter the folder are english here is 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.450
 where are all the maps 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.640
 these files are very necessary and a 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.620
 missing completely dried then 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.540
 it depends on the error that I throw them either 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.980
 any of these depends on the error 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.380
 that throws them the game within the game 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.720
 you copy it and go here and what 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.540
 replace with the file they have ok 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.790
 for the file that throws the error 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.490
 within the game then once 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.710
 have done all this already practically 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.150
 they can play call of duty 4 without 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.930
 No problem I wanted to do it 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.100
 practically from the beginning you know 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.080
 I doing all the steps and 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.380
 working and verifying that if I 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.790
 they served but I see that it is better to do it 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.380
 well since you took your 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.690
 conclusions to me has served me and have 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.700
 done several times that on my pc I started to 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.890
 other friends is pretty simple since 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.740
 when you get used to it then you know 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.210
 simply this they have to do everything 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.160
 this is downloading the file and 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.200
 decompress follow discovery 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.450
 install the patches copy the folder 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.770
 of the pont booster and depends on the error that 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.410
 I pulled them into the game to be able to 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.090
 replace the file ok so good 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.830
 nothing else 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.500
 but they liked it, I hope there 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.630
 Served like and subscribe if it was 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.300
 so I think it was a pretty good contribution 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.979
 good and good then nothing else here take 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.020
 use nelson waiting for you to pass it 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.330
 very well and that has served you so much 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.699
 I'll leave a couple of ip servers that I 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.970
 they like it a lot and in some ways if 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.689
 game is already like the zombies or like a 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.389
 mod 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.059
 How is called the rum if if 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.519
 call the room is to be able to make type 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:10.739
 Parkour is something very very good 

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:12.959
 I'll leave the IP iphes of my 

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:16.810
 favorite servers to enter and 

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:19.060
 well we play someday not and I'll leave you 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:22.360
 I'll leave the link of a video too 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.280
 which has a lot of codes codes 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.870
 of activation that will serve them for 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.850
 that you replace it in case you 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.740
 enter some server you get player 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.240
 kicked or something like that is an error that 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.310
 he also throws them for having the same 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.990
 another player's code so good 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.230
 I hope nothing has happened to them very well 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.250
 and what good has served them be careful 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.730
 until next time 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.730
 bye
