00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.510
 hey here squared by pocketpc.ch and 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.029
 Today I want you the kingdoms app 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.430
 of camelot battle for sinners show 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.900
 this is the app we have in front of us 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.250
 have it here on the ipad but there is 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.919
 also on the iphone 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.660
 and the special thing about the app is too 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.640
 still that there is the whole for android 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.770
 and your score is online 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.660
 as it is a mmo on all devices 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.000
 at the same time that means you can 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.530
 no matter where you are always playing on the go 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.539
 with the iphone 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.120
 in between then at home on the ipad 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.239
 I want a good thing here we 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 can see the ipad variant is exactly 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.510
 same as the iphone variant 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:55.320
 we can change this one time and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.329
 then 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.730
 so year and make the whole game 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 on the iphone once on now i had to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 once here that the app close and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.760
 Then sign up again if you look 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.380
 it logs in at the same time somehow 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 find that a bit but so you can 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.990
 always back and forth between with the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 equipment and I am here now in the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 app the whole is as I said a mmo her 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.229
 you have to build your kingdom and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.009
 You can go to the kingdom later 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.650
 attack enemy 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.280
 alliances close trade and operate 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.320
 so on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.940
 there is a castle here that is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 inner castle in the inner castle you can 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 all production sites, so to speak 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.160
 build a blanket so to speak flat 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.420
 build research facility barracks in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.690
 later on you will build soldiers 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.149
 Can camp watchtowers and so on then 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.780
 there is still the outer castle in outer 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.399
 Bockermann the whole raw material raw material 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.140
 plants for food stone and wood 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.990
 But there are gold gold in the castle 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.630
 to control the inhabitants through and with 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.170
 These raw materials could be later in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.739
 the castle, for example, to build soldiers again or 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.060
 you can explore new things and 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.230
 Although in the chemistry lab , for example 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.970
 research something I just show it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.140
 times, I can do this 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.360
 would like to rebuild an archer and saw 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.579
 can not build archer because 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.110
 I still miss them 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.920
 actually nothing but the red 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.660
 are here 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.850
 that means i can go to my chemistry lab 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.329
 Sound can go on technologies 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.720
 to scroll down to define it says 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.519
 me 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.519
 I still lack wood and level 4 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.569
 now I can go on technology 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.099
 Wood and research and now too 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.290
 you can see an hour 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.730
 wood for six minutes at level 4 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.170
 after that I can explore with many 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.250
 theoretically and then I can 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.569
 Build archer and that's how it works 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.890
 whole game always back and forth 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.330
 meanwhile you can always get his 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.950
 further expand production facilities 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.349
 to get raw materials faster if you can 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.090
 you can go outside again 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.500
 continue to go outside and see the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.080
 world map so to speak 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.599
 Once you see where you are, you see 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.390
 his neighbors are the same and you have 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.920
 you can then attack the neighbor 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.280
 your teacher or when I get up 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.540
 play click here below 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.930
 game is about to arrive 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.500
 Let's go back to my castle like that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.030
 one is in the castle one can or also 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 everywhere down here with maicons yet 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.349
 see what happens so is also on 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.549
 I have my fight here 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.829
 report or one 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.780
 Game report of which I just out 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.060
 have played and you see here has 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.799
 a few hundred of them is 100 of them 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.040
 Johann is still very inaccurate 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.359
 but that can be improved by 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.650
 eagle eye researches and so always come 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.769
 continue to improve and improve 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.090
 and improve what just a mmo game 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.100
 I like the gameplay pretty much 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.880
 well, there is also a quest here 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.170
 can do here and I have one 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.060
 completed and that is the bauer 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.450
 Chemistry lab if you ok click one 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.620
 Here are a few bonus resources allocated 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.670
 That's how I play the game 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.000
 act if you do not know what you are 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.760
 At the beginning we have to do here 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.530
 a chat there you can all people 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.910
 if you later in a chat 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.169
 Alliance is still our alliance 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 then you can chat with the alliance 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.720
 people chat 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.960
 We have different items 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:33.539
 we can use that one can win 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.520
 or which one also finds down alliance 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.139
 if you could have one now 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.300
 join alliance or to alliance clients 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.870
 then you can join with his 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.530
 play together in a group 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.970
 You can chance this if you kill 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.850
 if you have 1 degree per day, this is one 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.540
 then make a gamble 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.130
 train training troops is direct 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.350
 a shortcut to zune or research 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.910
 you can quickly research the lab and it 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.640
 you see a highscore and under 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.770
 Options we can do our karamay the 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.390
 that the manufacturer hire 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.600
 that means they could always be with him 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.310
 the same game is playing here on the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.140
 iphone or here on the ipad 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.300
 and otherwise here could be the sound and 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.950
 I always like switching off 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.740
 because I do not associate my people with it 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.060
 because we want to annoy infos we can 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.100
 a push constantly 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.900
 notification when something is ready 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.090
 put is a nice thing for me 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.400
 and you can choose the language here 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.400
 I have German the easiest for me 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.270
 if you liked the video 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.159
 subscribe to our channel or 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.960
 visited on www pocket pc works 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.039
 that of looking forward to even if you here 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.719
 thumb would make high 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.689
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:55.409
 Next time when you are in the castle 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:57.960
 Can you or anywhere down here with 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.400
 icons still see what happened 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.590
 By the way, on post click I have here 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.870
 my fight report education wise one 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.099
 Game report of which I just out 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.439
 played and you can see her here 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.210
 he has a few hundred of them 100 of them 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.840
 is johann that is still very much 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.080
 inaccurate 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.400
 but that can be improved by 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.659
 eagle eye researches and so always come 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.810
 continue to improve and improve 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.009
 and improve what just a mmo game 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.990
 I like the gameplay 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.439
 pretty good there is also a quest here 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.580
 you can do it 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.289
 Here I have one completed and 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.840
 although bauer the chemistry lab out if you 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.939
 ok clicking here a few bonus 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.199
 allocated resources so you can 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.740
 the game I am acting when you are 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.690
 do not know what to do in the beginning 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.909
 we have a chat here you can 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.289
 if all people can chat globally 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.669
 one is later in an alliance 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.050
 we still have allianz chat there you can 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.759
 then chat with the alliance people 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.000
 We have different items 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:56.580
 we can use that one can win 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.560
 or which one also finds under alliance 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.180
 if you could have one now 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.339
 join alliance or to alliance clients 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.920
 then you can join with his 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:08.580
 play together in a group 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.410
 this chance one can if you token 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.480
 you have 1 free gambling per day 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.650
 then you can do under training 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.150
 Training troops directly is a 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.160
 shortcut to do so only under research 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:24.030
 you can quickly go to the lab and research 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.480
 tolerated one sees a highscore and 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.820
 Under options we can do our karamay 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.440
 the which is the set manufacturer 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.650
 that means they could always be with him 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.330
 the same game is playing here on the 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:41.190
 iphone or here on the ipad 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.350
 and otherwise here could be the sound and 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.000
 I always like switching off 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.790
 I should not use my fellow human beings with it 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.110
 want to annoy the info we could 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.150
 Authority to push constantly 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.950
 notification when something is ready 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.140

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:59.450
 and you can choose the language here 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.450
 I have German the easiest for me 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.290
