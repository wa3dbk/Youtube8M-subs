00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.060
 here is the timing chain 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 here they are the yellow yellow principle labels and 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.430
 then it goes to watered like a till i still 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 time I see yellow gold 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:21.960
 yes yellow gold two camshaft us 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 that's probably kaleva also myself on 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.119
 channel has its mark on the camshafts 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:46.860
 worth put on one tag on 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:52.469
 gears here on 2 now installed 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.990
 gear in place here it is tag 1 all 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:04.440
 pour the master label 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:07.680
 here it is now stand on that yellow 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.810
 yes she is yellow not here 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.120
 pinned you showed right then he 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.410
 yellow and here we are now i am correcting 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.410
 pulling up means but boringly significant 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:38.570
 put marks 1 2 we breed points 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.760
 opposite one arc and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.050
 just stretched the chain 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.330
 since we have a slack side this 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.020
 it means exactly this we correct as 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.020
 it should be 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.729
 Now you have to set tags 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.069
 the label we have is not from here to me 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.879
 you can see here somewhere there is a risk 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.879
 did not give in to him 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 drawing here is some risk a visible place for 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.480
 we get 90 eyes and here's the vertical 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.680
 it is necessary here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.090
 there you can see there 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:52.489
 a little louder no no match risk or 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:03:04.810
 no black no behind the wheels 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:04.810
 105 wait wait 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.340
 yes yes yes yes exactly bees straight cut 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 yes yes yes all 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.790
 there was a rag inside 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.250
 we pulled the chain put a mark 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.340
 here it is the first first camshaft here 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:57.490
 tomorrow is the third down on the crankshaft 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:01.510
 need to see from here that is black black 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:07.000
 the link on the tag is closer from this side 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:10.210
 hand flashlight yes here's a black link 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.400
 just so supplies we made sure that they 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.390
 all stand in their places with us 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.870
 the tensioner is now free here it is 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:24.670
 hanging loose will stand 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.810
 hydraulic tensioner here he is it 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.810
 need to fix demand 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:41.690
 that it was free to shove 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:44.030
 This model will have a bit of problems 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.479
 forcibly even from which is fixed 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:52.280
 this is not fixed after what 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:54.830
 fixed on the tensioner here it is 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.870
 twisted it into place once again make sure 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.740
 that we have everything on the tags in their places and 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.740
 then below 3 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:15.889
 pliers and pliers such that 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:23.610
 we have a dozen three jobs and enough other 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:26.610
 which we fixed and just 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.639
 now we wiped them a little tight 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:34.020
 the load is large and they all cut off no 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.319
 enough to cut all of our chain 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.319
 stretched 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:45.030
 here's a wallet and due to oil pressure he 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.360
 also here bestows everything with us only for 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.300
 expense of oil pressure on his extrude 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:06:00.650
 either now we have it so cinch motorboat 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.650
 street clockwise you need
