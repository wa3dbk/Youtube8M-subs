00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.900
 It seems that attention is quite concentrated. 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 When I look up the watch from the reference book, it is almost 1 am. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 Tomorrow is also the morning to start the exam. 

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:20.403
 Let's end here, get ready to sleep... 

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:28.124
 To pull the curtains and walk into the window, there is a figure at the moment. 

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:32.288
 (window) 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.800
 The human image is as small as a child. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Looking up at my room... looks like that. 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.699
 But, so late, the children are outside alone... 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.700
 Maybe, my parents are in a place I can't see. 

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:08.295
 However, I care more about tomorrow's exam than that. 

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:11.803
 I didn't pay attention and pulled the curtains. 

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:19.765
 Because of the sound of knocking on the window, I woke up. 

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.475
 The room was dark. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 I watched the watch and it took me 2 hours before I fell asleep. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 What is the sound... 

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:40.560
 Will it be, big drops of rain hit the window... 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.700
 But even if you listen carefully, you can't hear the sound of rain. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.800
 Get up from the bed, try to open the curtains, and the road is completely wet. 

00:01:57.852 --> 00:01:59.990
 It seems that it is not raining. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.100
 What is the sound? 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 Thinking like that, when I was about to pull the curtains, something appeared in my eyes. 

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:22.610
 That is, a small handprint. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 Just like the handprint printed by a child, it appears on the window glass. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Look carefully. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 Here, here, here, here, here too. 

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:48.880
 Why is it in such a place... 

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:56.140
 I put my face close to me and found one thing. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.500
 That is, the fingerprint is not outside the window. 

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:06.080
 It is printed on it. 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.100
 In the dark window glass, my room was reflected. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.800
 There is the look of the girl who is staring at me from behind...
