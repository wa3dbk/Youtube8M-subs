00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.250

 not like that 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.159
 because he is by comparison 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.289
 we'll see each other the same way 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.509

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.009
 when adults 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:58.289
 and ultimately he and nothing interrupts Bernd Liebhardt at the Laber 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.149
 he continued to assert 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.149
 he cooks the radio runs for over a year 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.639
 uses the same 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.169
 which turns out to be a bathtub 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.659
 remember this 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.869
 then he could learn from something 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.869
 Exit of the winning road

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.969
 on a rather bleak for him 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.709

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.759

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.330
 gekraxelt 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
