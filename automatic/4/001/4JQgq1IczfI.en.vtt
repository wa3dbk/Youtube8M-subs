 in fact the mattress on the floor a bag of 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.840
 sleeping on the mattress that is not native to 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.470
 last of his normal 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.720
 It's very cool but not only there with little 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.140
 thing to go camping that always goes 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.580
 need have pliers scissors all this 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.110
 Then I already have it, I leave it there. 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.690
 in my bag 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.570
 I'll soon be buying a bag and several 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.880
 accessories then one more month from now 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.240
 Today, I mean to finish everything I 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.910
 I needed to camp and I'm going to do a 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.870
 video show for you okay 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.500
 the tension will be do not see these deals 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.800
 from the tv there guys to the campaign with 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.870
 little thing and this thing of the map so 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.140
 do is blame campfire is compact with 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.470
 wood 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.990
 these things do not do that because it's worse 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.860
 thing that is always good to have time to 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.860
 day off 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.689
 and by chance it's raining you're going 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.020
 to have to do a little of some 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.509
 It's cold, it's raining so do not 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:42.110
 so do not try to use the campfire type 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:44.270
 natural if you go there and pick up sticks 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.750
 business in which it was running quite 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.659
 yeah stay there spinning round to start 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.129
 to leave fire and so much of it will not come so has 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:07:05.419
 pick up and take the sound match us it was 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:17.240
 so good the compact bass does not let the 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:21.529
 high level of the UN 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.500
