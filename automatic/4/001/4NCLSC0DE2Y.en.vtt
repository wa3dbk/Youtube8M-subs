00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.380
 here is the thermometer for stoves and 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.210
 fireplaces that we propose on to 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.320
 dawn to the point like this is a 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.690
 device that allows you to manage the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.510
 temperature of your stove in any 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.689
 security and optimize returns 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.820
 this thermometer is usually shipped 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.300
 in cardboard packaging sometimes in 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.619
 plastic 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.840
 it's a very simple device 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.000
 of use at the back you see 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.379
 Leman here that allows to fix the device 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.089
 on the duct and then the filament all 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.949
 around dilates and drives the eel 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:46.639
 here rolled up that will indicate the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:49.539
 temperature on the back of the packaging 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:53.600
 instructions for use in French 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.979
 the apparatus and American manufacturing in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.959
 devices of very good quality compared 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:02.229
 to what we could find on the 

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.229
 market there we'll do a little test 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 we will put the device 30 cm above 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:25.090
 hair then we are finally burning 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 I do not know if the referee goes a lot 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.200
 evolve 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.880
 we see that it is missing a little bit 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.230
 risk of getting closer to the temperatures 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 of smoke around 100 ie to the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.729
 low limit below which the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.070
 combustion is not good we have 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.810
 energy losses and in product of 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.630
 black smoke from creosote including 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.979
 for ducts and air quality 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.340
 in optimal combustion zone is good 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.750
 in the right zone around 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 300 degrees we are overheating and there 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.330
 however, we are potentially 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 danger 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 the stove or the ducts what can 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.369
 sometimes generating chimney fires 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.400
 so in these cases we will reduce 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 the arrival of air for example rent 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.830
 fuel supply see here 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 the eil and at 100 Â° so we will either 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.620
 accelerated the arrival of air be put back 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.620
 fuel
