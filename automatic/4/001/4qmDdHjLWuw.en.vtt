00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.830 

when<00:06:06.610> i'm<00:06:06.699> afraid<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.120> finish<00:06:07.389> wasn't<00:06:07.690> up<00:06:07.810> to

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
when i'm afraid the finish wasn't up to

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.460 
when i'm afraid the finish wasn't up to
it<00:06:09.090> that's<00:06:10.090> your<00:06:10.419> didn't<00:06:10.840> really<00:06:11.139> deal<00:06:11.349> with

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
it that's your didn't really deal with

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.559 
it that's your didn't really deal with
the<00:06:11.620> wide<00:06:11.800> play<00:06:12.069> was<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.460> lovely<00:06:12.970> dribble<00:06:13.479> down

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
the wide play was a lovely dribble down

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:14.999 
the wide play was a lovely dribble down
the<00:06:13.750> flank<00:06:14.020> but<00:06:14.229> really<00:06:14.620> they've<00:06:14.770> got<00:06:14.979> a

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
the flank but really they've got a

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.770 
the flank but really they've got a
double<00:06:15.370> look<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.669> try<00:06:15.849> and<00:06:15.940> stop<00:06:16.210> that<00:06:16.449> and<00:06:16.630> I

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
double look to try and stop that and I

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.480 
double look to try and stop that and I
think<00:06:16.870> with<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:17.319> attempt<00:06:17.680> at<00:06:17.770> gold<00:06:18.009> to<00:06:18.250> they

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
