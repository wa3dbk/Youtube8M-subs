00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
it drives the air out which will lose
humidity<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.289> seeds<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:49.860> moist

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
pooping their poop but you know this is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.319 
pooping their poop but you know this is
how<00:02:04.950> nature<00:02:05.189> works<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.759> want<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> emulate

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
how nature works and we want to emulate

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.499 
how nature works and we want to emulate
nature<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:06.960> much<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> garden

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
nature as much as we can in the garden

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.080 
nature as much as we can in the garden
so<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.899> can<00:02:09.080> be<00:02:09.110> difficult<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.670> always

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
so that can be difficult so you always

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.660 
so that can be difficult so you always
want<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> read<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.629> back<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:13.069> package<00:02:13.519> if

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
want to read the back of the package if

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.280 
want to read the back of the package if
you're<00:02:13.790> buying<00:02:13.940> some<00:02:14.150> potting<00:02:14.480> soil<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.989> make

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
you're buying some potting soil and make

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.780 
you're buying some potting soil and make
sure<00:02:15.409> it<00:02:15.500> doesn't<00:02:15.680> have<00:02:15.769> any<00:02:15.799> manure<00:02:16.190> products

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
sure it doesn't have any manure products

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.890 
sure it doesn't have any manure products
and<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.120> mean<00:02:17.269> one<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> other<00:02:17.569> things

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and I mean one of the other things

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.690 
and I mean one of the other things
that's<00:02:17.959> very<00:02:18.349> important<00:02:19.010> critical<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.549> that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
that's very important critical is that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.089 
that's very important critical is that
it's<00:02:20.120> quite<00:02:20.510> unfortunate<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:21.440> don't<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.010> if

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
it's quite unfortunate I don't know if

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.559 
it's quite unfortunate I don't know if
this<00:02:22.220> would<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.430> considered<00:02:22.760> veganic<00:02:23.180> or<00:02:23.450> not

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
this would be considered veganic or not

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.930 
this would be considered veganic or not
like<00:02:23.780> human<00:02:24.200> manure<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.830> human<00:02:25.549> manure<00:02:25.790> is

a<00:02:42.950> very<00:02:43.160> good<00:02:43.310> question<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:44.329> that

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
a very good question that what that

a very good question that what that
brings<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.110> really<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.379> point<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:46.160> year

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
brings up a really good point this year

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.860 
brings up a really good point this year
maybe<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.030> do<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.359> I<00:02:47.450> start<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.720> nice

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
maybe what I do is I start a nice

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.710 
maybe what I do is I start a nice
compost<00:02:48.349> pile<00:02:48.620> leaves<00:02:49.340> banana<00:02:50.030> peel<00:02:50.269> all<00:02:50.510> that

stuff<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.079> my<00:02:51.230> organic<00:02:51.709> waste<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
stuff with my organic waste so that

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.240 
stuff with my organic waste so that
maybe<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:54.170> future<00:02:54.260> I'll<00:02:54.620> have<00:02:54.829> my<00:02:55.010> own

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
maybe in the future I'll have my own

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.220 
maybe in the future I'll have my own
soil<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.910> use<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.299> bring<00:02:56.420> inside<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.140> the

soil to use to bring inside in the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.599 
soil to use to bring inside in the
wintertime<00:02:57.500> let<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.190> know<00:02:58.280> keep<00:02:58.489> it

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
wintertime let it you know keep it

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.580 
wintertime let it you know keep it
thought-out<00:02:58.900> start<00:02:59.900> my<00:03:00.019> seeds<00:03:00.260> with<00:03:00.440> that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
thought-out start my seeds with that

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.500 
thought-out start my seeds with that
soil<00:03:00.890> but<00:03:01.190> it's<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.640> would<00:03:01.879> be<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.030> process

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
soil but it's a it would be a process

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
soil but it's a it would be a process
kind<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.840> thing<00:03:02.989> right<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> mean<00:03:03.440> making<00:03:04.010> your

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
kind of thing right I mean making your

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.039 
kind of thing right I mean making your
own<00:03:04.310> compost<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.060> definitely<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> process<00:03:05.660> to

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
own compost is definitely a process to

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.150 
own compost is definitely a process to
get<00:03:06.230> started<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:06.769> you're<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:07.010> starting

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
get started if you're just starting

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280 
get started if you're just starting
seeds<00:03:07.609> they<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.060> seed<00:03:08.420> starting<00:03:08.870> mixes

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
seeds they have seed starting mixes

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.020 
seeds they have seed starting mixes
which<00:03:09.470> actually<00:03:09.769> don't<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.069> any<00:03:10.250> compost<00:03:10.790> in

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
which actually don't have any compost in

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.940 
which actually don't have any compost in
there<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.840> they<00:03:11.959> would<00:03:12.170> be<00:03:12.349> vegan<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.829> know

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
there so they would be vegan you know

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.080 
there so they would be vegan you know
you<00:03:13.010> normally<00:03:13.549> they're<00:03:13.700> made<00:03:13.849> out<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.000> like

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
you normally they're made out of like

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.909 
you normally they're made out of like
something<00:03:14.359> like<00:03:14.569> peat<00:03:14.810> moss<00:03:14.989> or<00:03:15.260> coconut<00:03:15.319> coir

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
something like peat moss or coconut coir

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.920 
something like peat moss or coconut coir
which<00:03:16.099> is<00:03:16.220> basically<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.639> ground<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:17.090> coconut

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
which is basically the ground of coconut

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.960 
which is basically the ground of coconut
shell<00:03:18.230> yes<00:03:18.530> yep<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.190> that's<00:03:19.639> an<00:03:19.760> excellent

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
shell yes yep and that's an excellent

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.430 
shell yes yep and that's an excellent
medium<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.389> start<00:03:20.599> your<00:03:20.690> seeds<00:03:20.900> until<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
medium to start your seeds until you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.960 
medium to start your seeds until you
take<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.769> outside<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:22.430> start<00:03:22.700> planting

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
take it outside and then start planting

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.879 
take it outside and then start planting
it<00:03:23.120> out<00:03:23.239> right<00:03:23.870> right<00:03:24.169> I<00:03:24.290> mean<00:03:24.440> talking<00:03:24.769> about

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
it out right right I mean talking about

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.170 
it out right right I mean talking about
beginning<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.370> garden<00:03:25.639> we<00:03:25.730> could<00:03:25.849> go<00:03:25.940> into<00:03:26.090> a

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
beginning a garden we could go into a

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.420 
beginning a garden we could go into a
whole<00:03:26.359> other<00:03:26.480> subject<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.169> it<00:03:27.919> gets<00:03:28.160> you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
whole other subject because it gets you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.729 
whole other subject because it gets you
know<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.609> can't<00:03:28.970> use<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.540> manure<00:03:30.319> which<00:03:30.620> is

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
know you can't use the manure which is

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.020 
know you can't use the manure which is
what<00:03:30.889> most<00:03:31.040> people<00:03:31.160> use<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.700> they're<00:03:31.849> like

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
what most people use if they're like

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.370 
what most people use if they're like
organic<00:03:32.569> but<00:03:32.780> then<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.989> can't<00:03:33.230> use<00:03:33.260> a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
organic but then you can't use a

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.930 
organic but then you can't use a
chemical<00:03:33.859> so<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.099> there's<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.310> happy<00:03:34.639> medium

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
chemical so then there's a happy medium

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.819 
chemical so then there's a happy medium
and<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.120> really<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:36.079> important<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.620> get<00:03:36.709> it

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
and you really it's important to get it

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.920 
and you really it's important to get it
right<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.700> optimal<00:03:38.239> success<00:03:38.419> being<00:03:38.810> a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
right to have optimal success being a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.420 
right to have optimal success being a
beginner<00:03:39.079> gardener<00:03:39.590> I'd<00:03:39.709> see<00:03:39.859> many<00:03:40.010> people<00:03:40.160> do

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
beginner gardener I'd see many people do

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
beginner gardener I'd see many people do
it<00:03:40.579> some<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.180> my<00:03:41.269> friends<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.930> are<00:03:42.079> vegans

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it some of my friends that are vegans

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.409 
it some of my friends that are vegans
have<00:03:42.859> done<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.190> maybe<00:03:43.579> not<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.000> well<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.299> my

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
have done it maybe not so well in my

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.240 
have done it maybe not so well in my
opinion<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.989> I'll<00:03:45.349> compare<00:03:45.709> their<00:03:45.889> garden

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
opinion and I'll compare their garden

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.740 
opinion and I'll compare their garden
with<00:03:46.370> my<00:03:46.400> garden<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.180> their<00:03:47.329> garden<00:03:47.660> is

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
with my garden and like their garden is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.559 
with my garden and like their garden is
like<00:03:47.959> not<00:03:48.889> as<00:03:49.220> productive<00:03:49.819> like<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:50.419> I<00:03:50.510> mean

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
like not as productive like so I mean

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.300 
like not as productive like so I mean
that's<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.989> big<00:03:51.169> challenge<00:03:51.410> with<00:03:51.829> not<00:03:52.010> getting

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
that's a big challenge with not getting

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.949 
that's a big challenge with not getting
enough<00:03:52.549> nutrients<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.450> soil<00:03:53.629> if<00:03:53.840> you're

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
enough nutrients in the soil if you're

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.360 
enough nutrients in the soil if you're
trying<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.230> do<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.440> began<00:03:54.680> eclis<00:03:54.980> because<00:03:55.160> a

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
trying to do it began eclis because a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.979 
trying to do it began eclis because a
lot<00:03:55.879> of<00:03:55.910> times<00:03:56.209> most<00:03:56.450> people<00:03:56.750> are<00:03:56.840> putting

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
lot of times most people are putting

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.479 
you use if you want to do Vantage begin
a<00:04:11.510> garden<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:11.930> be<00:04:12.049> successful<00:04:12.709> it's<00:04:13.220> actually

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
a garden and be successful it's actually

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.879 
a garden and be successful it's actually
called<00:04:13.609> rock<00:04:13.940> dust<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:15.079> rock<00:04:15.290> dust<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.680> just

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
called rock dust so rock dust is just

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.699 
called rock dust so rock dust is just
ground<00:04:16.130> up<00:04:16.459> rocks<00:04:16.840> mostly<00:04:17.840> like<00:04:18.019> volcanic<00:04:18.409> or

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
ground up rocks mostly like volcanic or

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.950 
ground up rocks mostly like volcanic or
basalt<00:04:19.159> rocks

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
basalt rocks

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.020 
basalt rocks
that<00:04:20.960> adds<00:04:21.260> trace<00:04:21.710> minerals<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.400> 70<00:04:22.790> plus

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
that adds trace minerals so like 70 plus

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.420 
that adds trace minerals so like 70 plus
trace<00:04:23.360> minerals<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:24.350> your<00:04:24.440> garden<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.400> that

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
trace minerals to your garden so that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.010 
trace minerals to your garden so that
your<00:04:25.670> plants<00:04:25.820> will<00:04:26.090> have<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> nutrition<00:04:26.810> in

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
your plants will have the nutrition in
