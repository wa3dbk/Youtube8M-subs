00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120
 hey people today is finally back 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.070
 really cool weather in berlin the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 Sun seems all is reasonably 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.070
 dry is still very cold 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 but I decided anyway 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 finally some cult again today 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.440
 tutorial for you to turn I'll 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.060
 today one of the basic exercises in the parcours 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.060
 show the safety board 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.990
 The boards are generally cracks with 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.690
 which passes over small obstacles 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.879
 such as walls or fences whatever you can so 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.780
 in the way is hoods of cars or 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.399
 small trash cans or what I know yes 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.059
 you will pass soon find what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.269
 also knows word belong eg the tash the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.039
 cat the speed word yes the safety board 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.079
 The safety volt is also a very good one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.489
 practice for the speed word I do it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 then later in another tutorial 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.260
 again will show basically 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.850
 should you the basics of all parcours so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.469
 good that you can do it on both 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.149
 You can do everything on your own and always spontaneously 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.979
 decide out of the situation 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.299
 you can not or not at all 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.450
 really have to decide but that 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.100
 instinctively correct therefore if 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.649
 you prefer the left side 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 Do it the way I trained it first 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.590
 times bit on the left side 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.110
 but you can do it really well as soon as you get it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 then on one side you can switch well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 the pages and try him on the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.600
 the other side just as well 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.939
 so that he really instinctively sits 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.070
 and someday just like that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.359
 No matter what 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 which side you are right now or 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.869
 which hand is right in front that you are there 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.789
 would not have to stop and go big 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.259
 I declare the safety board now 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.020
 first so that her left hand 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 If you prefer him with the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.049
 right hand then you have to do 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.939
 of course, do everything wrong 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.740
 So if you left-handed on 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.140
 set you also at the same time 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.310
 the right foot on the wall on the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.929
 If he says it with the right hand 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.670
 of course, put with the left 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.350
 foot on the wall when you at / t 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.299
 gold with his left hand on the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.700
 obstacle you also jumps with the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.130
 left foot from her pulls the right leg 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.039
 sideways up 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.409
 Out of the movement, the hand sets 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.500
 on the obstacle and push with the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.349
 right foot goes a short way away with the left 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 walk under your leg and I show 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.130
 just take it easy 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.430
 in the beginning made the safety board first 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.810
 very slow and stand out of it 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 out puts the wall makes 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.769
 a hand to the wall and a swinging 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.660
 Stay on the wall and stay first 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.090
 up there on the leg like that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.570
 Now you go slowly with the foot under 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 right down the leg 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.270
 Above all, pay attention to them 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 enough distance between hand and foot 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.260
 on the obstacle load so you with 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.800
 still knows your inner foot through and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.800
 does not get stuck 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.910
 I hope I could help you 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.660

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.280
 thumbs up

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
