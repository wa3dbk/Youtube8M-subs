what's critical to the feel of a guitar

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.510 
what's critical to the feel of a guitar
of<00:00:19.460> course<00:00:19.850> is<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:21.050> neck<00:00:21.260> but<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:21.830> know<00:00:22.340> it's

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
of course is the neck but you know it's

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.609 
of course is the neck but you know it's
even<00:00:22.760> more<00:00:22.910> critical<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.720> sound<00:00:24.200> and<00:00:24.530> the

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
even more critical to the sound and the

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.300 
even more critical to the sound and the
tone<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.340> how<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:26.150> connect<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.770> neck<00:00:28.010> to<00:00:28.279> the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
tone is how you connect the neck to the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.599 
tone is how you connect the neck to the
body<00:00:28.630> Martin<00:00:29.630> guitar<00:00:29.930> has<00:00:30.020> never<00:00:30.230> just<00:00:31.160> bolted

on the neck it never could produce the
kind<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:34.550> vibrational<00:00:35.420> interaction<00:00:36.350> between

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
kind of vibrational interaction between

now I have to tell you the dovetail

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.410 
now I have to tell you the dovetail
joint<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:20.430> probably<00:01:21.430> most<00:01:21.460> prohibitively

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
joint is the probably most prohibitively

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.870 
joint is the probably most prohibitively
expensive<00:01:22.799> aspect<00:01:23.799> of<00:01:24.039> a<00:01:24.220> standard<00:01:24.640> Martin

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
expensive aspect of a standard Martin

expensive aspect of a standard Martin
guitar<00:01:25.149> do<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.360> know<00:01:25.450> why<00:01:25.659> it<00:01:26.439> takes<00:01:26.740> us<00:01:26.950> so

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
guitar do you know why it takes us so

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.370 
guitar do you know why it takes us so
long<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.670> make<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.060> Martin<00:01:28.450> guitar<00:01:28.479> but<00:01:28.990> early
