I<00:00:49.010> guess<00:00:49.519> generally<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.059> way<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.300> children

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
I guess generally the way the children

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.180 
I guess generally the way the children
get<00:00:50.929> attention<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.829> by<00:00:53.499> making<00:00:54.499> a<00:00:54.769> nuisance<00:00:54.920> of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
get attention is by making a nuisance of

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.549 
get attention is by making a nuisance of
themselves<00:00:55.249> and<00:00:55.909> causing<00:00:56.899> trouble<00:00:56.929> and

themselves and causing trouble and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.750 
themselves and causing trouble and
stirring<00:00:58.489> things<00:00:58.640> up<00:00:58.909> and<00:01:00.609> there's<00:01:01.609> been<00:01:01.730> a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
stirring things up and there's been a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.840 
stirring things up and there's been a
lot<00:01:01.969> of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
lot of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420 
lot of

questions made by these people over the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.590

years<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:09.220> mostly<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.820> questions<00:01:10.180> relate

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
years but mostly the questions relate

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.870

any real questions about Who I am or

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.230 
any real questions about Who I am or
what<00:01:17.320> I'm<00:01:17.500> doing<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:21.000> most<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.150> time

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
what I'm doing it's most of the time

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.690 
what I'm doing it's most of the time
what<00:01:22.600> we<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:23.020> these<00:01:23.290> people<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.220> we<00:01:24.340> ignore

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
what we do is these people as we ignore

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.390 
what we do is these people as we ignore
them<00:01:24.970> because<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.890> they're<00:01:27.040> saying<00:01:27.070> is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
them because what they're saying is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.180 
them because what they're saying is
really<00:01:27.700> insignificant<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:29.080> most<00:01:29.710> people<00:01:30.010> can

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
really insignificant and most people can

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.860 
really insignificant and most people can
see<00:01:30.400> through<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.670> fairly<00:01:31.380> easily<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.870> they

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
see through it fairly easily and so they

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.490 
see through it fairly easily and so they
only<00:01:35.020> make<00:01:35.260> themselves<00:01:35.680> look<00:01:36.690> silly<00:01:37.690> when

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
only make themselves look silly when

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.490 
only make themselves look silly when
they<00:01:38.710> when<00:01:38.979> they<00:01:39.130> engage<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.900> politics<00:01:41.320> of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
they when they engage in the politics of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.109 
they when they engage in the politics of
personal<00:01:41.710> destruction<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:45.119> people

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
personal destruction because that people
