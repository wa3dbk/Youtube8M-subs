00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.259
 hello everybody today I'm going to show a product 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.849
 For you what is an epic leprosy memory is 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.119
 a heatsink 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.630
 ram memory is like this and if this product 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.050
 It's very good because you're going to 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.119
 temperature of your memory and goes well 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.730
 cheaper than you buy the 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.910
 memories like platinum concerts 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.110
 dominator dominator and and several others 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.350
 models 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.870
 this way you will cool memory 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.020
 even making that memory has a 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.329
 performance in years x mp, which is a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.360
 kind of overclocking in memory 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.950
 I recently had a stretcher with her 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.840
 sea memories that aims to 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.800
 I particularly have nothing to 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.700
 complain 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.890
 It's not like a pinga stone that's a 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.009
 color series out there but it is a memory that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.780
 I never had a problem with her and her. 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:14.659
 had xm before a ddr3 memory of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.460
 1333mhz rex and mp thighs for her 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.200
 worked at 600 cool time you me 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.680
 in this case recommends this pattern of 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.850
 memory that will increase or 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.960
 automatically the memory goes this goes 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.299
 end up warming up more audience than this 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.760
 same pattern you did with the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.799
 Past is the past will heat up more 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.500
 clock common to see you enter the 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.119
 water cooling to balance this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.010
 it's not that temperature 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.010
 Ok show you now 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.119
 the memory is already with the mounted heatsink 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.090
 It's true that I got a single memory. 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:04.700
 I showed it I took it now I'll show it to 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 How do you dissipate the cooler? 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:14.840
 here folks it comes with 2 clips 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.269
 chrome plating does not oxidize here which is where 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.129
 You'll catch the memory, I'll even like it. 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.030
 to tighten and a little bit before 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.810
 put it in the memory 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.870
 two 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.299
 and here the sink hears that here in it 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.930
 he has a ribbon 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.500
 in which it is a double-sided sink 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.040
 heat is kind of like a tape and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.400
 thermal paste at the same time here until 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 pull ac milan had to show for 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.900
 What are you from underneath? 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.130
 here is right 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:02.540
 remembering 3m staff has no brand 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.060
 better than that right here 3m she's the one 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.090
 largest company is neither insulation tape nor I 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 particularly only use 3m that anticharm 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.200
 the logistics very well do not let go 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.359
 A good time here he comes with this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.810
 known for the easy here he goes 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.530
 get the heat from the memory chips of the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.540
 chips that are in your ram and will 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:32.440
 transfer heat from the chips to the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 aluminum and it comes with only two parts 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.970
 how it works you fit into the other 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:47.930
 so come with memory puts her here 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:52.910
 strip or obviously this is the role of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:58.670
 centered memory goes down and 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 comes with two clips and locks here I 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.810
 lower the new queen 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.499
 This is a very good equipment, and I 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.530
 usually every machine that I listen to 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.060
 I posted my clients and it's worse. 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 important 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 I think the ideal is you are the main 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.919
 you build a computer is you keep 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.650
 is the quality of this equipment 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.900
 It's no use, you just have to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.669
 power but in a short time the 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.979
 problem computers can 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.729
 overheat which is more so on 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.250
 then the reliability of the equipment is 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.620
 more important than performance 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330
 good you have performance time of tea 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.470
 leave in hand 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:53.710
 these are these factors here. 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:57.710
 I have lots of them in stock and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.050
 today I bought a stock of duty 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.389
 many units of it and I'm getting 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.720
 nor at 10 reais each 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.430
 who has the interest is just to enter 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.190
 in touch 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.460
 a big personal hug until the next 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.460
 video
