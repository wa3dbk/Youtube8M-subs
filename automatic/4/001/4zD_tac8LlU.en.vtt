00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.090
 it was the dress rehearsal for Werder Bremen before the dfb cup match Bad 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.150
 Hersfeld she Heidenheim opponent beds for Olympiakos Piraeus record champions 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 record cup winner current title holder in Greece and in the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.240
 Moment everywhere Below in the second training camp therefore also some 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.290
 Olympiakos cases between beds in the BAB a Winner four and a half thousand 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.960
 Spectators do not want to miss this game Rudy was at the beginning 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.169
 not disappointed either 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.019
 it's just the third minute 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.390
 lays down for Marko Baacke 7 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.039
 a first warning shot for Franco Costanzo 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.239
 the new goalkeeper 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.389
 at Olympiakos Piraeus Bergkamen from 11 SID 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.450
 Little to see before the poster in the initial phase the better chances 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.739
 definitely owned 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 the green example the advertising advice on the expectation of Mary 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.720
 13 minutes 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 Variant a blade over 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.770
 rather, a real yardstick should be on victory 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.080
 Quote the daily as already played in the pre-season in Seefeld in 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.980
 Austria against Polonia Warsaw won with 2 to 1 do so should et al 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.590
 the low 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 the next step Follow for Olympiacos Piraeus 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.810
 however, they needed Werder to be dangerous for the first time 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.250
 Tim Wiese's goal to come this was an attempt by Albert like everyone else 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.759
 20 minutes were played in the offensive put Thomas Schaaf again 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.979
 on Markus Rosenberg and Laverty 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.200
 be there always 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.220
 HCL attracted attention with his achievements and Thomas Schaaf 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.229
 still trusted him against videos and that 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.720
 should be at Baur 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.050
 again pay off as already against Freiburg the long ball by Andreas Wolf 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.829
 on 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.109
 Laverty enter the train ticket or carport Pettyfer Real 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.860
 Below, the ball Laverty rolls over the slipper a bit 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 Dream gate became 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.730
 when Athens went in b 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.030
 only three minutes later on the other side free kick 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.690
 For Olympiacos Piraeus, this woman was already hoping Abu Dhabi he has 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 every wrong parker one of four 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.120
 in the starting lineup 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120
 These are Susanne Bauer Walter's stands 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.259
 Alberto Giacometti Barclays Haiti at this opens 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.529
 neither 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.670
 also there was not much missing like me 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
 in the third minute of the CEOs Marko Marin the first really good 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.880
 opportunity 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.309
 for the critical 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.959
 seven minutes before the break then again 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.709
 Werder Bremen via Marko Marin 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.939
 the sign penetrates also frees hand and in the end waits 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.269
 Markus Rosenberg would have too 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.019
 was decisively disturbed Baumbach have ears 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.219
 he wanted to put on the fall-back on that were also the 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.359
 most spectacular action even if not 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.669
 but finished nice feed by Marin and further directed by Aron 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:55.379
 hand 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.729
 Unfortunately, it does not work out only for the pause Thomas Schaaf 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.210
 which was certainly not completely satisfied with what 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.500
 that was the vote on the defensive especially Sokratis Papastathopoulos 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.589
 she praises him well 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:12.739
 together 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.739
 with Andreas Wolf 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.719
 very consistently hear that and expected CMO from him but a total of 0 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.169
 at the foot the two ears over to a very good 500 m 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.540
 20 years the tour then she certainly will not know and percent 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.889
 for that we are looking for the time to play together - 05 of dementia 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.160
 Edith positively expressed the Greek 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.919
 6 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.919
 Nadal or the offender his mother and a goal 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.379
 i like that it was important game i am quite satisfied with it anyway 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.200
 second use with this team for it was actually quite good 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.629
 I think I can be completely satisfied 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.989
 like on monday and on the 2nd 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.779
 Surprisingly, Ernesto Valverde was also the coach of Olympiacos 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.870
 Satisfied with what he had offered 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.860
 actually he wanted to change completely during the break but left it at 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.879
 the team that had been in the field for the first 45 minutes 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.200
 and that also has a good opportunity Albert si Rostek so 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.629
 Fiftieth threatened 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:21.150
 David Südkurier had involuntarily read the Wiener Zeitung 

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.090
 and then forgives 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.110
 Alberts like her hair 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.360
 Olympiakos wanted to put pressure on advertising recruiters to make mistakes 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.759
 But by doing so, Berger had also felt good in ways 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.789
 the offensive Laverty 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.009
 Lukas Schmitz 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.900
 and Philipp Bargfrede air the engine in the 58 minute nice pass 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.569
 Laverty 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.339
 It tries all first and there was a short time before on mountain huts 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.039
 however, will also be back on Philipp Bargfrede appeal 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.819
 scoring for it was also restarted 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.610
 Brad Pitt was bitching she made this a good idea but in the end everything went 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.050
 good the lead for Werder Bremen 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.870
 not or before that had to 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.090
 Ernesto Valverde, of course, changed hands several times before, though 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.550
 is dead and 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.660
 Las again before him played Apel, CTO was also the glazed 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.919
 loses the ball 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.810
 to Marko Marin 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.060
 or is that lightning fast? Lena also took her over to Markus Rosenberg 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.220
 The band was clear was soon Markus Rosenberg but it will be worthwhile 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.849
 who there at Frankfurt Costanzo 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.570
 because he is so because Werder had seen enough he changed again 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.230
 Among other things, year is something draws 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.620
 one of the biggest critical talents 20 years young still play 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.689
 peaceful land scored three goals he came 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.400
 For Alberto everyone in the game but first of all a small one 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.309
 Dread moment for Thomas Schaaf if the Werra drives with suddenly active 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:03.979
 Shakers had to be treated for a long time you knew milk what is missing them 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.360
 because it was or the influence of the opponent in the short moment 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.139
 Air bookings and percent will land onshore and percent Barcelona em-gold 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.589
 but dog owners are also renamed from China and India 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:19.849
 Ulm currently caught in the conscience 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.759
 not quite so well but run against the Schloßstraße of this lot 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.390
 already 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.910
 the last seconds Holebas formerly at 1860 Munich under contract to something 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.670
 she is forgiving is the shocked powerplay was spotted at the party 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.150
 for the first to second floor it still had to clear the line 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.999
 but the situation is cleaned up by the exit 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.809
 Galifi from waiting in the middle Alexander Klopp saw I wait for her mourning card 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:48.059
 Way Felix Incidents 4 4 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.839
 Protest Euro 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:57.059
 Additional time 1 2 1 but Kurth article presale Barbie Peter it'll be 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:58.690
 a nice success 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.450
 This dress rehearsal before the dfb cup match has worked so well 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.960
 meanwhile again 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.009
 the guests from Essen watch the videos 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:13.210
 of course he applies this result also Thomas Schaaf I have to and so on
