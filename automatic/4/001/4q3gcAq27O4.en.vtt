00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello all youtube people like this one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 He speaks to Jonathan and I bring them good 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.030
 finally people had asked for a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.889
 white gameplay 2 I know that people who 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.220
 subscribed to my channel was because I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.390
 carlos game useful more than anything else 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.070
 bothered film treatment or that I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.480
 rise much I've done 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:30.410
 or infinite as it is pronounced but 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:34.190
 if we went up often it was because it was a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.560
 Raven and I had thought to come up from the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.100
 moments that the captor buys 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.590
 and upload that game then I did not want it 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.629
 leave as well as an as an idea be it 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.600
 I did and had to upload all the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.460
 they asked to continue like this does not lead him to leave 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.199
 half as some games that I've already 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.920
 uploaded and left them to me then not 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.920
 I want it to happen 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
 and 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:05.159
 the goal of this gameplay 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.420
 apart from what was the last one that is 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.270
 the last game I had to do 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.409
 so I can take out the golden camouflage 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.930
 of the m-12 16 and also take out the last 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.850
 golden camouflage I needed for myself 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.580
 to be able to take out the diamond camouflages 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.600
 of the shotguns so now I have the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.280
 like kite diamond flashes 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 of the rifles 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 so the other weapons what gun 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.110
 sanctioners 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 the subject that deals with the title is because 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.990
 He was explaining a bit of my 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.759
 experiences I had or experiences that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.880
 I had to remove the camouflage from tablecloths 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.740
 leather 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 my head is not easy with kites 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.009
 they are not that difficult either but they will have 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.010
 the easy ones but for me it was difficult in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.260
 the sense of the repercussions or 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.440
 the consequences that brought me play with 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 the shotguns 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.319
 and I'm not talking about consequences at the level of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.650
 the way to play and things like that yes no 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.819
 about the sense that they insulted me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.680
 they tried cloud and came messages from 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 when roasting my facebook account 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.400
 network arrived released me from the game 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.500
 a voice chat of the game because I do not 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.750
 meant because according to me I was a bad guy 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.239
 shit 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.740
 a bad rookie culmed millions too 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.640
 I played with a shotgun 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.490
 I do not know if people hate both more 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.069
 Young people who hate them 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.189
 competan osses hates them 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.620
 and classify them as if they were like 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.110
 they were bad 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.239
 I do not know I do not know what's wrong with that one 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.190
 can play by the shotgun is a weapon 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.769
 what is at stake is a kind of weapon 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.700
 that we have nobody nobody forbids you 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 use it unless it's a type of game 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.310
 well personalized but people anticipate 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.950
 he had after playing the shotgun and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.200
 the shotgun is not easy to use 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.819
 game mode than the default mode as 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.920
 the way one plays with the shotguns 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.500
 and with the shotgun is different from playing 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.519
 with a shotgun rifle is a weapon of 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 very short range what of what this one 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.110
 it flows to that you have to have to go 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.940
 towards the clash with the enemies 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.090
 and I hired the defects and the only 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.070
 way to be able to fight effectively with 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.010
 the shotgun I am I had to learn 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.420
 almost after a long time of many 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.370
 games the shotgun 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.740
 get the idea and I said I have to play 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.650
 well but play as a game with some eyes 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.360
 sky with a rifle and just in 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.140
 when 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.250
 so I do not know I do not understand that mentality 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.320
 that discriminate and one that is game to the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.320
 shotgun and people be from the game 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400
 I do not understand, I do not know if people have 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.510
 past I do not know what in which they think a thousand 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.640
 subscribers 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.920
 I read from people that this video if so 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.230
 it has happened to you that you do not occupy 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.480
 shotgun or bojan to the people who occupies 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.800
 shotgun on my part I do not have any 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.810
 problem that flirty people 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.340
 there are ways to affect people that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.930
 has the comet and the people you have 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.729
 completed is complete also has its 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.740
 difficulty against other types of weapons 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.110
 like the sniper who has never 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.110
 to gain the rank by distance 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.780
 and good one of the themes and the other 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.949
 has not gone up black ops 2 is one of the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.300
 most played games in this time like this 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.330
 that I think I 'm going to have enough 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.069
 gameplay re-recorded nothing like that is I think 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.580
 was this the first record that a 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:21.909
 game that I recorded after I stopped 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.909
 go up for that and good ended 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.169
 writing why that level is so 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.720
 important the idea of ​​being prevented 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.700
 that they take the like people and good 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.120
 I wish you liked it and we'll be 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.380
 watching in another call of duty video 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.990
 black ops' or another video that your 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.260
 altering so this was jonathan and 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.260
 goodbye
