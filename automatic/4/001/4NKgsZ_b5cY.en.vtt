00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 many competitors do not imagine how 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.330
 Your lives may change. 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.389
 following a career within a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.120
 rodrigo's institution has joined the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.850
 economic development as a clerk and in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.029
 only four years went through several 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.119
 internal selective processes until 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 the manager this achievement was responsible 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 for providing the stability and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.660
 comfort for your family 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 something that led me to study for 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.290
 competition is the very market 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 work then I had important 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 work in a private area and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 that 's one thing I realized that you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 work is dedicated to the return to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.270
 Sometimes you do not have the security you can 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.070
 vacation and when a return has not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 that security and I'm a person without 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 that I liked the feeling of having a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.850
 security stability for 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 family until you have a plan in the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 future and the public tender came 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.739
 The meeting was then able to realize that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 at least and meet the needs with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
 relation to this could be programmed 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.939
 plan for a year from now , two , three 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.439
 years 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.860
 I always gave from there always 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.409
 I studied and passed in peace and in some 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.049
 contests and I rode a lot too 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 I started there to see the things that 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 I was failing where I was. 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.909
 missing right and I was there at that point I 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 I remember that at the time I had a great 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.829
 and banking knowledge difficulty 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.710
 I thought about stopping this one in mine. 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.770
 face and difficult and I have drawn a goal yes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.030
 I 'm not going to sleep without studying two hours. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 thirty and banking knowledge I 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have to learn and of course much goes. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 of discipline of you if cops there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 looking at the name lying down without having studied 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.759
 So often we cross paths 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 and drop your hand and start studying alone 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.890
 then when a time comes that starts 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.320
 to have the results that happen in the year 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.509
 past another one passes there begins to reap 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.149
 the fruits of your effort then to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.490
 the attendee passes by when he 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.079
 dedicates to need when he is there that he 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 that makes the difference here he will have 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.459
 time to finish his approval so 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.780
 I like the finance area and I started to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.340
 search for financial 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.920
 and I had the opportunity to pass 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.450
 I passed several bank contests, right? 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360
 and now in the institution that I am 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.190
 now it's been a long time and another point 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.459
 important collection as I talked to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.650
 salary of people think that the salary is 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.900
 both right but welcomed the salary 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.069
 has financial institutions that 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 You have the opportunity to grow. 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.190
 within which was my case and the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.770
 It's too fast too fast so it starts 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.380
 gaining the detected amount there in 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.530
 45- year issue earning more than ten 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.350
 Sometimes it is not the value of a starting salary 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 an interesting thing in my 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.239
 career within this institution is 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.400
 inside is that I do not remember what my 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 wife was winning and I won 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.050
 other promotion 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.819
 so it was good for was really cool for us 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.650
 like family at a time that was 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.200
 pointing out that the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.000
 Expenses like this but then it went well 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.709
 gratifying for us as a family. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.160
 fact that it is increasing our 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 family and I managed to get this 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.200
 which has helped us a great deal and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.940
 people managed to play and managed to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.250
 a much better future for my family 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.200
 with my son than my parents 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.790
 they managed to make it clear not because of me 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.950
 of my parents I know they did the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.290
 maximum they could not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.269
 but I 'm having the opportunity to give 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.519
 something better in the family something better for 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.519
 the daughter what in her time I could not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.890
 a dust 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:40.680
 going to meet b is an idea of ​​opposition 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 an idea of ​​direct confrontation and go to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.949
 meeting air is a favorable idea of 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.789
 something positive, cool, people know 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.550
 then that if esplanation is perfect is 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:57.539
 with which I think my idea 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.250
 meets the idea of ​​the word 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.250
 staff is talking and not
