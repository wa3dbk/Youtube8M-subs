00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hi, people, I'm going to take these laps today. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.700
 decorated for you to keep material 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.700
 school pretty good 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.050
 The materials are ordinary black pencil in 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.160
 enamels of the things that you want 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.460
 a base of enamel also pinch of 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.980
 wood and Styrofoam paint or the clinic 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.680
 of the colors you want and a brush 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.890
 first try the pencils then with 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.140
 a soft brush but it will pass two 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.890
 and expects to hit on what 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.890
 one coat and the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 I got this for her here just to power 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 stay 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.519
 the pencil here to expect to dry in a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.519
 keep running around 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.910
 the viking 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330
 china is 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 the church 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.560
 after the pencils have already dried you 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.290
 take some of the glaze 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.540
 the school with a little penguin here and goes 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 doing the pencil drawing that you 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.150
 to prefer 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 with the dot quality inn 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.860
 so in that one of those polka dots 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.580
 This is what I'm going to do. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 so I got it right near here doing 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 little shoes 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.730
 the enamel erodes its people 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.870
 after I already had how you come with 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.480
 a bright base or a normal base 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.080
 to pass up as if it were a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.080
 kiss 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.910
 So, we were like this. 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.120
 pencil 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.730
 they look great they'll never be 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.650
 same as the other because a node is 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.950
 cute head 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.510
 these two here I just had some new ones 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 with glitter and that's what I had 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.800
 already painted josÃ© grape served and the almost one 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.440
 glitter glaze is silver and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.020
 This one I have not tried, I have not left anything. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.800
 in the same green and ride enamels with 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.400
 very thick glitter is golden 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.980
 It stayed there so I hope that you 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.350

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.930
 easy but leaving school supplies 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.060
 much more fun and with your face 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.980
