00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.770 
hello everybody toast mommy you're
bringing<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:01.979> another<00:00:02.100> halo<00:00:02.669> 4<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.419> today

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
bringing you another halo 4 video today

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.960 
bringing you another halo 4 video today
we're<00:00:03.959> taking<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.529> look<00:00:04.560> at<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.190> bolt<00:00:05.580> shot

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
we're taking a look at the bolt shot

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.210 
we're taking a look at the bolt shot
because<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:07.140> don't<00:00:07.470> know<00:00:07.529> about<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.799> but<00:00:07.980> I

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
because I don't know about you but I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.919 
because I don't know about you but I
think<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:08.670> pretty<00:00:09.090> freaking<00:00:09.750> ridiculous

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
think it's pretty freaking ridiculous

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.610 
think it's pretty freaking ridiculous
and<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:11.040> little<00:00:11.370> too<00:00:11.610> overpowered<00:00:12.450> now<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.230> went

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and a little too overpowered now I went

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.470 
and a little too overpowered now I went
in<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.250> custom<00:00:14.639> games<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.059> tessa's<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
in to some custom games and tessa's it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.890 
in to some custom games and tessa's it
out<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.440> exactly<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.789> overpowered<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
out to see exactly how overpowered it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
out to see exactly how overpowered it
actually<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.100> look<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.029> frickin

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
actually is and just look at the frickin

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.170 
actually is and just look at the frickin
range<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.619> thing<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.100> mean<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.910> guy's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
range on that thing I mean that guy's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.650 
range on that thing I mean that guy's
getting<00:00:24.600> shot<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.320> mile<00:00:25.619> away<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.789> let's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
getting shot from a mile away now let's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
getting shot from a mile away now let's
test<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> shotgun<00:00:28.949> let's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
test that out with the shotgun let's

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759 
test that out with the shotgun let's
let's<00:00:29.609> compare<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> ranges<00:00:30.390> look<00:00:30.840> at<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.050> he

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
let's compare the ranges look at that he

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
let's compare the ranges look at that he
doesn't<00:00:32.070> even<00:00:32.130> die<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> shotgun<00:00:33.300> now

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
doesn't even die from the shotgun now

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.380 
doesn't even die from the shotgun now
granted<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:35.850> bit<00:00:36.030> harder<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
granted it is a little bit harder to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
granted it is a little bit harder to
shoot<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.110> has<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.590> charge<00:00:38.010> time

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
shoot because it has that charge time

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
shoot because it has that charge time
that<00:00:39.000> rigid<00:00:39.570> charge<00:00:39.930> time<00:00:40.230> were<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> pass<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that rigid charge time were a pass to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.779 
that rigid charge time were a pass to
fire<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.020> secondary<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.399> even

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
fire but it's a secondary it's not even

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
fire but it's a secondary it's not even
a<00:00:44.910> power<00:00:45.180> weapon<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.899> book<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.739> should<00:00:46.980> be

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
a power weapon in my book this should be

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
a power weapon in my book this should be
a<00:00:47.129> power<00:00:47.399> weapon<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.600> stay<00:00:48.989> as

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a power weapon and if it's gonna stay as

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
a power weapon and if it's gonna stay as
a<00:00:49.170> secondary<00:00:49.649> weapon<00:00:50.129> that's<00:00:50.280> equippable<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a secondary weapon that's equippable I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.680 
a secondary weapon that's equippable I
think<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> should<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> rain<00:00:54.329> should

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
think that it should be the rain should

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.799 
think that it should be the rain should
be<00:00:54.870> reduced<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.160> least<00:00:56.460> under<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> shotgun

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
be reduced to at least under the shotgun

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
be reduced to at least under the shotgun
and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.590> even<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> same<00:00:58.980> range<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and it's not even the same range as the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.740 
and it's not even the same range as the
scattershot<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> thing<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> ridiculous<00:01:03.059> I'm

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
scattershot this thing is ridiculous I'm

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.890 
scattershot this thing is ridiculous I'm
not<00:01:04.229> sure<00:01:04.290> why<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.129> secondary<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.450> what

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
not sure why it's a secondary but what

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
not sure why it's a secondary but what
do<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> guys<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
do you guys think put that down in the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969 
do you guys think put that down in the
comments<00:01:09.180> let<00:01:09.720> me<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> guys<00:01:10.920> think

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
comments let me know if you guys think

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
comments let me know if you guys think
the<00:01:11.700> bolt<00:01:12.060> shots<00:01:12.360> overpower<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> think

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the bolt shots overpower do you think

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
the bolt shots overpower do you think
they<00:01:13.530> should<00:01:13.710> nerf<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> how<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.820> think

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
they should nerf it how do you think

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
they should nerf it how do you think
they<00:01:15.180> should<00:01:15.360> nerf<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.140> could

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
they should nerf it maybe they could

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.039 
they should nerf it maybe they could
increase<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> charge<00:01:17.430> time<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.659> think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
increase the charge time I also think

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
increase the charge time I also think
maybe<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:19.950> too<00:01:20.250> quiet<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.850> feel

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
maybe it's a little too quiet I feel

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300 
maybe it's a little too quiet I feel
like<00:01:21.180> sometimes<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.900> game<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:23.070> even

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
like sometimes in game I don't even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
like sometimes in game I don't even
realize<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.420> someone's<00:01:25.259> charging<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> up

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
realize that someone's charging it up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
realize that someone's charging it up
maybe<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.729> make<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> sound<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> little

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
maybe they can make the sound a little

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.090 
maybe they can make the sound a little
louder<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.799> more<00:01:28.890> obvious

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
louder so it's a little more obvious

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
louder so it's a little more obvious
that<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.270> shot<00:01:30.540> by

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that you're actually gonna get shot by

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
that you're actually gonna get shot by
it<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.110> could<00:01:31.290> help<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.740> bit<00:01:31.890> too<00:01:32.130> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it that could help a little bit too but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
it that could help a little bit too but
I<00:01:32.729> definitely<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> best<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I definitely think the best way to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
I definitely think the best way to
balance<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> decrease<00:01:35.820> its

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
balance it would just be to decrease its

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899 
balance it would just be to decrease its
range<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.979> absolutely

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
range because right now it's absolutely

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
range because right now it's absolutely
insane<00:01:39.140> anyways<00:01:40.140> that'll<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
insane anyways that'll be it for this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.800 
insane anyways that'll be it for this
video<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> liked<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> video<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.630> can

video if you liked the video you can
