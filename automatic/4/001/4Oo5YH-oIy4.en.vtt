00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.570
 leaving people as they are then the day of 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.840
 Today I'm going to teach you some tips so that 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.449
 your photos look professional because what 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.609
 is what we need for a photo 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.279
 look professional first of all 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.039
 lighting a good lighting you should 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.250
 to take the photo where there is a focus 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.350
 who are you directly that is a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.300
 some distance not so close so that 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.510
 they are not due to shiny face but that 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.579
 be close that your face is very good 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.610
 illuminated or if not in front of a 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.129
 window is the other thing that we're going to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.350
 need either an editing program 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.800
 that shine on your face 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.550
 like the propeller and I for that took 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.940
 the perfect 365 that if you want to know how 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 edit with the perfect here I'm going to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.130
 leave the link and then let's start 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.500
 first of all we go to the skype boat 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.180
 and we choose the photo that you want to edit and 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 as here you can see what I mentioned 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.530
 of lighting is paramount here 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.020
 this photo looks that is illuminated me the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.720
 I took in front of a bulb but it's not so 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.940
 powerful and another very important thing that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.570
 the focus is not preferably yellow 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.270
 that is white and here is the picture that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.940
 same photo but edited with perfect 65 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.729
 where we see that he no longer has dark circles and that 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.330
 the face looks smooth that's very important 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.690
 because it is another thing that characterizes 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.690
 the professional cameras to one more photo 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.560
 professional that is it is seen that your skin 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.490
 it's as lawful as that so very pretty 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.730
 how perfect could you say and that's what 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.820
 what does this program do 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.860
 once we have the photo edited 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 that we already removed the watermark that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.190
 it is done when we are with perfect if 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.040
 you do not know how to do it here also you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.210
 I'm going to leave the tutorial on how to do it 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.080
 once we have it ready we are going 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.260
 mainly and what is more 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.450
 important the filters we choose the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.820
 filters that focus lighting on 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.800
 our face and that our hair 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.530
 make darker or give them 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.980
 depth and what is this filter is the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.170
 portal once we choose it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 make sure it's not the stop in the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.820
 If your photo is already illuminated, 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.160
 put it on high because it looks like very 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.560
 very loaded then I always try 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.010
 put the bass or the middle no more 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.560
 once we have selected this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.900
 filter we go again to the filters and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.370
 now if you can choose the one you want 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.849
 the one that suits you -more the one you like 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 plus 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.330
 I always choose the water after 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.090
 always the portal and then the letter that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.819
 It looks like that makes it stand out 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.860
 more points on your face that tend to 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.560
 get lost when you give enlightenment and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.220
 then very very important for you 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.140
 photo is more professional is to return 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.470
 the color that we took away by putting the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.640
 shine to the photo and that is done 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.330
 selecting the part of the brightness and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.489
 color in the saturation curves what 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.849
 you're going to do is in the middle part 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.370
 raise the curve a little so that it enhances 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.880
 all the color that was lost and remains 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.250
 perfect 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.650
 If we want to do something else they do 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.620
 the professional cameras that is erase 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.630
 the part of the fund that is like 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.200
 erased alone back nothing else we 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.540
 we are focused because we can do it 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 with the effect we can do is erase the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.680
 back leaving us to tools or 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.710
 tools and then effects and we select 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.850
 blur high or medium any of the 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.490
 two 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.250
 and with the brush we simply go 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.070
 painting the things we do not like 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.900
 and we can garzon and spaces 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.109
 small ones that do not reach because the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.020
 brush is very large very carefully 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.320
 we are blurring the parts 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.000
 let's see what they need and we can 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550
 change the size of the brush if we see 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
 that is very large and that will cover a 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.160
 little of our hair or any 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.290
 part that looks noticeable that we edit 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.900
 we change the size to the smallest and 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.180
 we give you a lot of zoom that's the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.410
 way easier and more practical because 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.390
 if we do it fast so that we do not 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.280
 remove so much time they will not stay 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.520
 results so parents as if what 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.460
 we did with a lot of sun and slowly that 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.160
 yes I assure you what is also very 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.460
 important to highlight is the eyes and how 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.060
 we do it with the same effect but with 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.540
 the depth point 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.010
 it's like that only one pass does not have to 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.050
 be perfect because you will not notice 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.910
 because the white classes of the eyes do not 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.800
 they matter but if you see the difference is 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.900
 marked and if you see that the hair is very 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.300
 opaque you do not like what we can also 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.280
 to do is highlight highlight the colors and 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.050
 the depth that's there so with 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.830
 the same one that we put in his eyes and what 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.300
 we put on the hair and on the clothes myself 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.460
 this case I wanted my hair to go up 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.430
 as brighter then first you 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.030
 I put the shine with the same brush on the 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.460
 same area and then I put the 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.580
 depth is also very helpful 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:55.070
 but a very important fact is not to touch 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:58.430
 the skin because there it looks very noticeable 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.650
 what is a is edited by that why 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.530
 was that at the beginning we put the filter 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.580
 of the back once we finished with 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.340
 all effects and filters to 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 come the time to see the difference 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.159
 we keep the photograph and ready 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.150
 and here we have a photograph of the 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.150
 before and after 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.450
 and we see how all the colors stand out 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.280
 the hair is very shiny clothing 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.080
 also and the back 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.370
 has been like blurry out of focus and 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.620
 so easy it is to have a photo 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.810
 professional without taking cloth with a 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.090
 professional camera 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.639
 and although you can not believe it, this picture was 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.330
 taken with my cell phone which is a samsung 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:54.270
 fein so it's not a very good camera 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.310
 but with the indicated effects it is very 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.169
 easy to make your photo look professional 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.570
 this was all for today's video if you 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.550
 liked to give him a little hand up shares 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.310
 the video and subscribe I'll be you 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.389
 watching the next tutorial Thursday we 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.840
 we see the next 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:08.840
 goodbye
