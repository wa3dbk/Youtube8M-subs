00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.040
 this year what is proposed also 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.110
 what are the innovations you present 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 this fair 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 first of all a complete review 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.720
 of our entire range and for two years 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 we returned firmly in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 important way in the world of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 competitions by sponsoring three teams 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.470
 and on the road among professionals is one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.800
 malta bike team that includes i 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.360
 best young people of Europe and the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 collaboration with the teams is there 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 giving a big hand in research e 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 development that is another area in the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.090
 which we are investing so much e 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 this year we are reaping the benefits 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 of all this work combined between 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.219
 research and development teams and we are 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.850
 presenting some bicycles of the gods 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.719
 updates of our models that 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 in the last year they gave us in 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.050
 great commercial satisfactions and that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 from what we are seeing in these first 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.710
 hours are giving us reason on the choices 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.180
 let's make these friends for example 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.810
 that we have done behind and can do it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.729
 maybe even describe it in his own 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 more competitive features 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.950
 very well we have fished well because it is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.010
 just the top of the range and this is the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.320
 bicycle that 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.970
 is used this year has been 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.120
 used by our two teams 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.860
 professional vacansoleil dcm e 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.690
 among other things with a frame equal to 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 this becomes a stage won on 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 stelvio and pellizotti won the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.860
 Italian professional league for 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.230
 a bicycle that we have in the range already 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.540
 this year and has been updated as 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.150
 we have entered e 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 within some areas of the frames from 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.680
 frame is a brand new fiber optic 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.300
 very high modulus is a fiber that for the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.870
 first time it is used in the world 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.400
 of cycling is called ums 60 and this 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.190
 allowed us to have a bicycle 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.890
 which was already very powerful and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.790
 today allows us I think I have the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.980
 absolute bicycle with weight ratio 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.380
 absolute best rigidity is one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.690
 high performance bicycle and a bike 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.150
 kata obviously very high value but 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.340
 which contains all the technologies I think 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.600
 available today in the world of 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.600
 carbon bicycle
