menu where you can tweak if all the

menu where you can tweak if all the
settings<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:14.880> um<00:00:16.670> we've<00:00:17.670> put<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
settings you want um we've put in this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529 
settings you want um we've put in this
character<00:00:18.840> creation<00:00:19.320> system<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:21.270> very

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
character creation system so it's very

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.890 
character creation system so it's very
very<00:00:21.720> basic<00:00:22.439> right<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:24.420> function

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
very basic right now but the function

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.759 
very basic right now but the function
works<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.980> after<00:00:27.349> after<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> sort<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.650> get

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
works so after after I sort of get

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.050 
works so after after I sort of get
everything<00:00:29.160> plugged<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> game<00:00:29.910> I'm

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
everything plugged into the game I'm

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.339 
everything plugged into the game I'm
going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> come<00:00:30.390> back<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> fill<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
going to come back and fill it all in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
going to come back and fill it all in
that's<00:00:31.650> that's<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> idea<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.820> everything

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that's that's the idea with everything

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
that's that's the idea with everything
basically<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.700> sort<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
basically is get the very first sort of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.119 
basically is get the very first sort of
version<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.399> done<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.809> back

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
version of it done and then go back

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
version of it done and then go back
towards<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> end<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> fill<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.660> more

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
towards the end and fill it in with more

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.400 
towards the end and fill it in with more
stuff<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.469> you'll<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:44.610> options<00:00:44.879> of

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
stuff so you'll have more options of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.299 
stuff so you'll have more options of
clothing<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> choose<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.890> you'll<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> able

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
clothing to choose from you'll be able

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.810 
clothing to choose from you'll be able
to<00:00:47.399> change<00:00:47.489> skin<00:00:47.820> color<00:00:48.200> gender<00:00:49.520> this<00:00:50.520> left

to change skin color gender this left

character loops this right side will
have<00:00:57.539> an<00:00:57.690> impact<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> game<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.239> your

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have an impact on the game so your

world um my load into this dev world and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
world um my load into this dev world and
one<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> first<00:01:16.020> things<00:01:16.080> i<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.470> show

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
one of the first things i want to show

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.310 
one of the first things i want to show
up<00:01:16.620> is<00:01:17.870> this<00:01:18.980> build<00:01:19.980> bar<00:01:20.220> has<00:01:20.430> changed<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.990> no

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
up is this build bar has changed it's no

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320 
up is this build bar has changed it's no
longer<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.040> hot<00:01:23.250> bar<00:01:23.550> that<00:01:23.910> we<00:01:24.000> saw<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
longer the hot bar that we saw in the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.620 
longer the hot bar that we saw in the
last<00:01:24.480> videos<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> reason<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.450> not

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
last videos the reason for that it's not

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.730 
last videos the reason for that it's not
there<00:01:27.840> anymore<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> reason<00:01:28.440> for<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.620> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
there anymore the reason for that is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.150 
there anymore the reason for that is
because<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.870> going<00:01:31.200> even<00:01:31.710> even

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
because it just got it going even even

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.040 
because it just got it going even even
as<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.850> making<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.450> gaming<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.960> was

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
as I'm making the gaming think it was

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.290 
as I'm making the gaming think it was
getting<00:01:34.410> annoying<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> set<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.270> my

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
getting annoying to have to set up my

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.450 
getting annoying to have to set up my
hotbar<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.050> time<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.530> sort<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
hotbar all the time and sort of do that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
hotbar all the time and sort of do that
so<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:39.000> we've<00:01:39.210> done<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.930> thrown<00:01:40.710> all

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so what we've done is just thrown all

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
so what we've done is just thrown all
the<00:01:41.010> blueprints<00:01:41.190> down<00:01:41.550> here<00:01:41.760> you'll<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.540> able

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the blueprints down here you'll be able

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.580 
the blueprints down here you'll be able
to<00:01:42.780> cycle<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.800> categories<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:46.350> most

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to cycle through the categories but most

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.980 
to cycle through the categories but most
likely<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.400> categories<00:01:48.000> once<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
likely will be more categories once the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
likely will be more categories once the
game<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.620> know<00:01:49.740> once<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.070> start<00:01:50.280> populating

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
game you know once I start populating

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.240 
game you know once I start populating
this<00:01:50.910> list<00:01:51.150> full<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.900> more

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
this list full of more and more

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250 
this list full of more and more
structures<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.570> idea<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.870> you<00:01:55.050> have

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
structures but the idea is that you have

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.370 
structures but the idea is that you have
them<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.650> down<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.700> ready<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.120> build<00:01:57.720> when

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
them all down here ready to build when

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.310 
them all down here ready to build when
you<00:01:58.530> need<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.750> all<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.110> things<00:02:01.260> I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you need to so all the first things I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.720 
you need to so all the first things I
want<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.470> show<00:02:01.620> off<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> campfire<00:02:02.460> since

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
want to show off is the campfire since

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.790 
want to show off is the campfire since
it's<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> most<00:02:03.270> primitive<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.110> most<00:02:04.260> basic

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
it's the most primitive and most basic

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.910 
it's the most primitive and most basic
of<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.340> buildings<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.530> very<00:02:07.680> first

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of the buildings this is the very first

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.950 
of the buildings this is the very first
version<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> campfire<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.240> again<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.780> UI

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
version of the campfire and again the UI

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.050 
version of the campfire and again the UI
and<00:02:10.320> everything<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.710> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> change<00:02:11.060> but

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and everything is going to change but

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.300 
and everything is going to change but
this<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.290> function<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.040> want

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
this is all just for function just want

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.070 
this is all just for function just want
it<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.520> work<00:02:14.730> before<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.240> go<00:02:15.450> back<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.840> sort<00:02:16.020> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it to work before I go back and sort of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.270 
it to work before I go back and sort of
make<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> pretty<00:02:16.620> but

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
make it pretty but

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.260 
make it pretty but
thrown<00:02:19.150> some<00:02:19.330> wood<00:02:19.480> into<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> start<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> fire

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
thrown some wood into it start the fire

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.650 
thrown some wood into it start the fire
starts<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.640> thread<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:24.940> another<00:02:25.120> fire<00:02:25.390> so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
starts up the thread on another fire so

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.470 
starts up the thread on another fire so
I<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.870> demonstrate<00:02:26.020> something<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:28.330> we've

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
I can demonstrate something but we've

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.890 
I can demonstrate something but we've
also<00:02:28.660> got<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.970> water<00:02:30.970> collector<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.660> this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
also got the water collector so this

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.710 
also got the water collector so this
will<00:02:32.050> collect<00:02:32.319> water<00:02:32.560> when<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.980> rains<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
will collect water when it rains and to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.199 
will collect water when it rains and to
demonstrate<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.500> I'm<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.610> make<00:02:37.000> it

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
demonstrate this I'm going to make it

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.520 
demonstrate this I'm going to make it
rain

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.020 

it's<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> start<00:02:41.280> raining<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.819> any

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's going to start raining here any

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.059 
it's going to start raining here any
minute

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.089 

there<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.489> goes<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.200> rains<00:02:50.469> whenever<00:02:51.010> it

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
there it goes so as it rains whenever it

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.670 
there it goes so as it rains whenever it
rains<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.640> requires<00:02:51.969> are<00:02:52.239> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> go<00:02:52.599> out

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
rains your requires are going to go out

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.190 
rains your requires are going to go out
just<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.730> rain<00:02:54.939> and<00:02:55.870> this

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
just because it is in the rain and this

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.860 
just because it is in the rain and this
will<00:02:56.379> fill<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.450> don't<00:02:58.599> want<00:02:58.780> your

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
will fill up so if you don't want your

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.479 
will fill up so if you don't want your
fire<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.349> go<00:02:59.469> out<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.950> rain<00:02:59.980> you're<00:03:00.370> gonna

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
fire to go out in the rain you're gonna

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.119 
fire to go out in the rain you're gonna
have<00:03:00.639> to<00:03:00.760> build<00:03:00.939> it<00:03:01.060> under<00:03:01.299> something<00:03:02.129> could

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
have to build it under something could

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.589 
have to build it under something could
be<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.519> edge<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.849> building<00:03:03.999> it<00:03:04.329> could<00:03:04.450> be

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
be the edge of a building it could be

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.550 
be the edge of a building it could be
your<00:03:05.019> own<00:03:05.049> structure<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.959> one<00:03:08.170> will

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
your own structure but this one will

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.619 
your own structure but this one will
start<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.400> one's<00:03:09.670> trying<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.299> start<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
start this one's trying to start it

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.569 
start this one's trying to start it
won't<00:03:10.750> start<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:12.010> idea<00:03:12.250> behind<00:03:12.340> this

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
won't start and the idea behind this

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.059 
won't start and the idea behind this
checkbox<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.480> when<00:03:13.659> it's<00:03:13.810> checked<00:03:14.169> this

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
checkbox is that when it's checked this

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.909 
checkbox is that when it's checked this
fire<00:03:15.489> will<00:03:16.109> turn<00:03:17.109> itself<00:03:17.349> back<00:03:17.469> on<00:03:17.739> just

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
fire will turn itself back on just

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.129 
fire will turn itself back on just
because<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.239> be<00:03:19.359> annoying<00:03:19.569> if<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.989> have

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
because it can be annoying if you have

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.470 
because it can be annoying if you have
multiple<00:03:20.349> fires<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.849> want<00:03:22.090> them<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.359> be

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
multiple fires and you want them to be

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.949 
multiple fires and you want them to be
running<00:03:24.090> whenever<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.239> rains<00:03:25.510> they're<00:03:25.840> all

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
running whenever it rains they're all

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.479 
running whenever it rains they're all
going<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.169> go<00:03:26.349> out<00:03:26.379> so<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.889> don't<00:03:27.040> want<00:03:27.340> that

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
going to go out so you don't want that

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.089 
going to go out so you don't want that
to<00:03:27.609> happen<00:03:27.639> you<00:03:28.000> want<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:30.010> a

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
to happen you want it's just a

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.179 
to happen you want it's just a
convenient<00:03:30.579> sort<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.849> thing<00:03:31.980> yeah<00:03:32.980> this

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
convenient sort of thing yeah this

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.439 
convenient sort of thing yeah this
automatically<00:03:33.699> start<00:03:33.939> up<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.209> sups

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
automatically start up on the sups

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.300 
automatically start up on the sups
raining<00:03:34.989> or<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:35.409> can<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.560> cover<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.889> up<00:03:36.040> and

we'll work so if you've noticed these

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.539 
we'll work so if you've noticed these
wood<00:03:39.669> planks<00:03:40.030> are<00:03:40.739> being<00:03:41.739> burned<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.250> they're

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
wood planks are being burned and they're

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.009 
wood planks are being burned and they're
generating<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:43.120> down<00:03:43.359> here<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.750> don't<00:03:43.959> have

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
generating this down here I don't have

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.839 
generating this down here I don't have
an<00:03:44.139> icon<00:03:44.409> for<00:03:44.439> it<00:03:44.680> yet<00:03:44.919> but<00:03:45.099> this<00:03:45.250> represents

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
an icon for it yet but this represents

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.089 
an icon for it yet but this represents
cold<00:03:46.180> you're<00:03:47.109> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.290> use<00:03:47.409> coal<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.799> filter

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
cold you're going to use coal to filter

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.009 
cold you're going to use coal to filter
your<00:03:48.129> water<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.389> would<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.659> to<00:03:49.810> filter

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
your water and you would have to filter

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.789 
your water and you would have to filter
this<00:03:50.290> water<00:03:50.590> right<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:52.090> mean

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this water right here and I mean

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.649 
this water right here and I mean
typically<00:03:53.799> rain<00:03:54.129> water<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.549> drinkable<00:03:54.819> but

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
typically rain water is drinkable but

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.050 
typically rain water is drinkable but
we're<00:03:56.409> in<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.560> apocalypse<00:03:57.099> and

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
we're in the apocalypse and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.300 
we're in the apocalypse and
there<00:03:58.660> could<00:03:58.780> be<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:59.170> lot<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.500> pathogens<00:04:00.160> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
there could be a lot of pathogens and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.100 
there could be a lot of pathogens and
stuff<00:04:00.610> in<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.819> air<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.360> you're<00:04:01.780> going<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.959> want

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
stuff in the air so you're going to want

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.660 
stuff in the air so you're going to want
to<00:04:02.200> filter<00:04:02.440> your<00:04:02.590> water<00:04:02.709> before<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.250> drink<00:04:03.489> it

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
to filter your water before you drink it

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.300 
to filter your water before you drink it
you<00:04:03.910> can<00:04:04.450> drink<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.590> need<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.950> but

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
you can drink this if you need to but

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.800 
you can drink this if you need to but
you<00:04:06.610> have<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.790> high<00:04:06.970> chance<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.420> sort<00:04:07.720> of

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
you have a high chance of sort of

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.830 
you have a high chance of sort of
getting<00:04:08.020> sick<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.560> stuff<00:04:08.770> like<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.150> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
getting sick and stuff like that and the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.080 
getting sick and stuff like that and the
way<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.170> do<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.860> would<00:04:12.430> get<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
way that you do that is you would get a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.610 
way that you do that is you would get a
container<00:04:13.450> fill<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.080> up

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
container fill it up

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.280 
container fill it up
and<00:04:15.950> then<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.340> need<00:04:16.579> some<00:04:16.880> way<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.229> filter<00:04:18.229> it

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and then you need some way to filter it

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.750 
and then you need some way to filter it
so<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.530> either<00:04:18.769> have<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.070> build<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.370> filter

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so you either have to build a filter

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.540 
so you either have to build a filter
structure<00:04:20.449> or<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:21.500> could<00:04:21.680> boil<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.220> by

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
structure or you could boil it by

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.590 
structure or you could boil it by
upgrading<00:04:22.910> your<00:04:23.030> fire<00:04:23.300> with<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.750> sort<00:04:24.620> of

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
upgrading your fire with a sort of

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.110 
upgrading your fire with a sort of
cooktop<00:04:26.600> on<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:28.130> then<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.400> conduct<00:04:28.760> also

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
cooktop on it and then this conduct also

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.430 
cooktop on it and then this conduct also
be<00:04:29.240> used<00:04:29.449> for<00:04:29.600> food<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.650> stuff<00:04:30.860> like<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.240> so

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
be used for food and stuff like that so

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.390 
be used for food and stuff like that so
yeah<00:04:34.570> we've<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.900> guess<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.860> guess<00:04:37.100> that's<00:04:37.280> about

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
yeah we've I guess I guess that's about

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.050 
yeah we've I guess I guess that's about
it<00:04:38.680> I'm<00:04:39.680> just<00:04:40.130> going<00:04:40.370> through<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.850> sort<00:04:41.000> of

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it I'm just going through and sort of

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.640 
it I'm just going through and sort of
adding<00:04:41.419> in<00:04:41.540> all<00:04:41.690> these<00:04:41.930> buildings<00:04:42.229> i'm

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
adding in all these buildings i'm

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.680 
adding in all these buildings i'm

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
working on the base economy right now

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.620 
working on the base economy right now
and<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.760> other<00:04:46.790> things<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.360> we're<00:04:47.510> working
