 hello everyone with you evgeha today i would 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.490
 I wanted to hold a short video for you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
 guide on how to make yourself a creative mod 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.960
 in the game seven days tude yes yes yes it is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.330
 really possible and thanks here 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 this video clip you can fly in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 creative and do whatever you want in this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 the game for starters I want you 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 We looked at a short guide how to install 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 this creative mod is therefore browsing for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
 installation we need only here 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:38.910
 this archive file here you are in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.680
 him and now we need to open special 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.059
 there and open the folder 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.410
 the value of this date folder is - and here it is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 So you see this one here they file 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 almost similar but the amount they 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.930
 a little bit different so here it is that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.879
 file just just throws here a 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.609
 move replacements I pre 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 I recommend to save the file for everyone 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.850
 case you never know what can happen 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 therefore take into account save 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 fit perfectly and now it can 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
 close it we go became really speaking 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.340
 basic service settings which i 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.040
 I will not indulge because roes are not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.160
 I know what they mean to guys, but I tell you 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.400
 Showed in general how to customize 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.739
 whole thing i think you guys do yourself 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.720

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 information fresh shoes game so to speak 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.650
 Well, by the example of the things you can 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.470
 here to do 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.239
 I think what to use so to speak 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.329
 cheats to condemn the game itself 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.010
 it is not reasonable and I do this 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.590
 you do not recommend to friends because 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.170
 it's very very stupid and it's just not 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.879
