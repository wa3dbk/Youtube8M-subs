00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.470 

and<00:05:28.730> let's<00:05:29.540> end<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.810> turn

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:52.239 

you

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.929 

here's<00:05:53.249> my<00:05:53.369> first<00:05:53.580> look<00:05:53.849> at<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.089> factory<00:05:55.939> ads

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
here's my first look at the factory ads

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.929 
here's my first look at the factory ads
502<00:05:57.689> region<00:05:57.929> wealth<00:05:58.189> minus<00:05:59.189> 6<00:05:59.369> the<00:05:59.519> cost<00:05:59.729> of

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 
502 region wealth minus 6 the cost of

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:14.910 
502 region wealth minus 6 the cost of
artillery<00:06:00.239> and<00:06:00.479> minus<00:06:00.719> 22<00:06:00.929> half<00:06:01.079> hands

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.280 

so<00:06:15.550> here<00:06:15.820> i<00:06:15.850> can<00:06:16.120> start<00:06:16.330> taxing<00:06:16.600> and<00:06:17.050> they

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
so here i can start taxing and they

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.110 
so here i can start taxing and they
won't<00:06:17.470> write<00:06:17.680> up<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.460> let's<00:06:18.670> see<00:06:18.850> what<00:06:18.970> we<00:06:19.090> can

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
won't write up and let's see what we can

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.680 
won't write up and let's see what we can
do<00:06:19.360> over<00:06:19.450> here<00:06:19.600> also<00:06:20.110> over<00:06:20.530> here<00:06:22.380> and

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
do over here also over here and

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.410 
do over here also over here and
alexandria<00:06:25.690> also<00:06:26.350> i<00:06:26.380> could<00:06:26.650> do<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:27.240> so<00:06:28.240> now

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
alexandria also i could do that so now

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:42.240 
alexandria also i could do that so now
