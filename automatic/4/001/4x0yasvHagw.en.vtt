00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.900 
favourites to lift the trophy for a
fourth<00:02:06.549> time<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.990> other<00:02:08.110> mall<00:02:08.380> store<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
fourth time the other mall store I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.520 
fourth time the other mall store I
thought<00:02:10.119> initially<00:02:10.329> China<00:02:10.899> had<00:02:11.110> more<00:02:11.319> chances

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
thought initially China had more chances

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.140 
thought initially China had more chances
to<00:02:11.739> be<00:02:11.950> Spain<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.549> they<00:02:12.760> were<00:02:12.819> at<00:02:12.970> home

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
to be Spain because they were at home

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.390 
to be Spain because they were at home
and<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.690> hard<00:02:13.989> court<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.160> team

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and on a hard court but it's a team

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.009 
and on a hard court but it's a team
competition<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.269> lot<00:02:16.420> comes<00:02:16.660> down<00:02:16.870> to

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
competition and a lot comes down to

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.259 
competition and a lot comes down to
Varitek<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.920> tape<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.030> who<00:02:19.120> will

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
win between cousins pain I think our

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.910
