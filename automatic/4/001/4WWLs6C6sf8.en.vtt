Ultimate Team the live draw is basically

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020 
Ultimate Team the live draw is basically

on<00:02:58.209> two<00:02:58.390> teams<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.959> then<00:02:59.200> they'll<00:02:59.950> play<00:03:00.310> out

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
on two teams and then they'll play out

the<00:03:00.610> group<00:03:00.820> sort<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.180> normally<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.500> i<00:03:02.740> think

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
the group sort of normally but i think

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.060 
the group sort of normally but i think
this<00:03:03.520> tournament<00:03:03.970> will<00:03:04.080> rely<00:03:05.080> not<00:03:05.380> not<00:03:05.890> on

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
this tournament will rely not not on

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.930 
this tournament will rely not not on
skill<00:03:06.490> but<00:03:07.090> will<00:03:07.330> rely<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:08.130> luck<00:03:09.130> basically

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
skill but will rely on luck basically

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.750 
skill but will rely on luck basically
and<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:11.320> will<00:03:11.560> rely<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.100> whether<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.610> get

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.640 
and it will rely on whether you get
assigned<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.390> good<00:03:13.540> team<00:03:13.750> or<00:03:13.870> bad<00:03:14.080> team<00:03:14.350> i<00:03:14.470> mean
