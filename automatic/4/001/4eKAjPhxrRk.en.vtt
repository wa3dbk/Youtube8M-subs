 welcome to switzerland 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.970
 breathtaking views 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.010
 plenty of work and low taxes not 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.440
 it is surprising that the streets of cities flood 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.230
 more and more people every year in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.830
 about 80 thousand new come to the country 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.599
 residents 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.230
 impressive number for country with 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.210
 population of only 8 million people 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 our industry our economy is up 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 a certain degree needs 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 expats but many underestimate this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.380
 the situation 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 swiss arrives much more 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.289
 foreigners than to any other country 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 elsi dual 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 Ansar Beit your 9 February Swiss 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.219
 decide whether to reintroduce quotas on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.930
 foreigners entering the country 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.480
 including residents of the European Union 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 although switzerland is not part of it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 signed an agreement with him on freedom 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 movement if the initiative is 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 taken the swiss to face the wave 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 resentment from brussels 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.199
 but supporters of the bill this is not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.000
 care a decade ago 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 swiss party representatives 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.800
 political elite enthusiastically 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.290
 perceived the idea of ​​joining the EU but 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 people have changed they saw flaws 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 saw how much the flow increased 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.479
 emigrants turned out to be much more 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.040
 than we expected 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.960
 therefore , Swiss relations have changed 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.530
 anti immigration 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.630
 slogans 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 At first, the initiative was supported only 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 a third of voters now more than 40 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.869
 percent so what is behind 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 the desire to limit the entry of foreigners 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.100
 Switzerland according to some experts 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.850
 Not the last role in this issue played 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.610
 emotions they create competition in the market 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.829
 housing at the labor exchange and even on the roads 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 so citizens are experiencing some 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.229
 grievances on which politicians play 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.350
 holding populist views 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.810
 politics 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.549
 but as in all of europe in switzerland 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.520
 anti migration measures appear 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.110
 resonate among the population and just 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 show that even voters without 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 specific political views can 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 to vent your grievances among them 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 and this swiss businessman owner 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.899
 cosmetics factory as a manufacturer 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.700
 I benefit from it the more 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.129
 number of people i will sell my products 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.319
 so much the better but besides that I still 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.150
 Swiss citizen and I do not want to live 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.260
 his country as a herring in a barrel 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.909
 Switzerland 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.370
 small country and we just can't 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.549
 to accommodate all the emigrants here so more 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.319
 proposed measures cannot continue 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.989
 touch and highly skilled 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.280
 workers and the basis without foreign 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.670
 labor force will not be able to function 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.530
 health education systems we 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 We will not be able to conduct modern business in 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.040
 features it concerns the scope 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.319
 financial services in particular 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 banks without foreign 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.430
 waiters and cooks will suffer our 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.030
 the tourist sector of switzerland is very 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.129
 depends on these people four out of ten 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.590
 Swiss companies including 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.629
 founded by foreigners last year they 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.139
 created about thirty thousand workers 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.269
 places 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.739
 learn from the battle and for us a little bit 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.930
 strange that now they are against 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.819
 foreigners because they don't need us 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.620
 stealing their jobs we just do 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.690
 the work that they will not do 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.260
 yourself so honestly i'm not really 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 understand the law there deliver probably 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 referendum will negatively affect 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.109
 Switzerland's relationship with but exists 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.459
 fear that the country might face 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.280
 much more serious economic 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.299
 the consequences of what she expects Lucy
