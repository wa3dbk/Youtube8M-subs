 the division of xbox during its first

 during his first eight months in the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.380

 xbox platform were increased by 1700 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.300
 million dollars 34 percent 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.870
 mainly due to sales of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.079
 xbox one during fiscal year 2014 it 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.860
 they have sold 11 million 700 thousand consoles 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.590

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.799
 consoles sold the previous fiscal year 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.180
 however the costs of the platform 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.630
 xbox they increased a 72 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.000
 two million one hundred thousand dollars then 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 because especially the increase in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.260
 manufacture of consoles and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.620
 big costs associated with the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 launch of xbox one advertising 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.280
 marketing and so on, yes, at 22 thousand 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.830
 100 million costs we subtract the thousand 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.960
 700 million income we have a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.810
 difference of 400 million dollars 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 launch of xbox one to the company to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 the division of xbox so let's wait 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.630

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.420
 xbox division does not generate losses and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.720
 final at the end of the day then at least 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.960
 begin to generate benefits for the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.630
 division of xbox and everything flows from a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
