00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.870
 Arseny from Arseny Yatsenyuk likes 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.270
 talk but it can go sideways to him 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.350
 as we are to you now 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.730
 demonstrate it is inconstant 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 in almost all matters 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.840
 they created such a financial pyramid 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.730
 starting with the bretton woods agreement 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.130
 only brilliant people can do it 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.850
 put the whole world on a single injection 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.180
 us dollars and print them yes they are great 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.770
 financial pyramid he decides interesting 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.109
 did he share these thoughts with 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.579
 US president barrack Obama when 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.679
 talked to him in the white house 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.170
 but more interestingly, Yatsenyuk stated that 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:42.339
 America has made Russia its victim 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.960
 financial fraud I remember you 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.749
 He said that Russia has earned a lot 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.940
 money but also where they they were lowered for 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.859
 year the central bank of Russia spent 300 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.589
 billion dollars i will tell you that 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.600
 happened Russia developed it again like 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.199
 how allowed to earn and then all 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.089
 taken away 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.129
 she was simply not allowed to use 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.969
 the money she received from the sale 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.739
 oil and gas 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.280
 all the money went to maintain the course 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.500
 the ruble and now this money is not there but 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.920
 According to Yatsenyuk, Russia has a very good 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 the president is passing there still Putin his 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.790
 changes the way he performed his 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.040
 historical mission to save Russia 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.840
 where was the big gap between the classes 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.240
 and clans between the common people and 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.040
 oligarchs as in Ukraine in Russia 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.350
 there were five oligarchs who were tearing 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.720
 country apart with loyal to them 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.310
 MPs, we see that Putin chose 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.810
 certain way and i can't 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.730
 compete with him by quantity 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 great decisions that he made 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.810
 Yesterday I realized that it is not known that I 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.100
 did i lead so big and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.280
 unmanaged country 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.500
 I will share with you my faithful 9 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.030
 poems 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.130
 Sorry that Arseniy Yatsenyuk does not want 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.350
 collaborate with the person he is about 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.540
 such a high opinion in certain 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 moment kiev hotel partnership with nato but 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.820
 Oddly enough , Yatsenyuk has his own 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.270
 bills from the alliance she does not know and the plague 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.650
 know why they buy over our 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.750
 military transport aircraft to me here 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
 most interesting is supposed the same as 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.690
 we are partners 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.179
 I would like us to sell ours 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.720
 airplanes on to nato countries but they 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.820
 buy airbus boeing and embraer 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.740
 p but nato will not use their 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.930
 helicopters and you enjoy our 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.590
 Of course much more profitable to send in 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.740
 Darfur Ukrainian helicopters 5 some 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 modernization oles action so Yatsenyuk 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.970
 changed my decision about membership 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 in nato but what about his favorite European Union 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 because of which all this chaos began 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.570
 in Ukraine we will become part of the great 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.790
 Europe because we are Europeans and I 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.460
 I put it our first priority 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.680
 so that we become part of Europe and our tsen 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.360
 task great honor to be part of 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 which he has been singing for many years 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.990
 making another move on the chessboard and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.120
 I declare that this is the only way to 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.709
 his countries and all this in order to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
 finally admit that this is never 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.570
 there will be a tonic no one is going there 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.880
 no one else take it we already 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.370
 understood and moreover nobody will accept 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.080
 Ukraine in which 46 million inhabitants and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.030
 which is approximately equal in area 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.670
 France Ukraine acts as 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.709
 a kind of border area big 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.980
 border strip between the European Union and 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.810
 Russia between democracy and the axis of evil from 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.620
 went the way of forming a belt 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.840
 security and again impartial 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.489
 remarks about russia but it's not about 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.830
 these statements and not even anyone 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.019
 whether or not Yatsenyuk supports the case 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.000
 the presence of a plan is his lack of concern 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.140
 many including even those who supported 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.750
 Yatsenyuk during the state 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.730
 coup why because they are bigger 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.140
 don't know what exactly they support 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.140
 Marina Kosarev rt 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.630
 itself proclaimed and the government in 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.300
 Kiev, came to power in the wake of the people 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.430
 discontent due to the refusal of the president 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.480
 Yanukovych to sign an agreement on 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.480
 association with the EU 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.200
 I will not be if the agreement with the European Union 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.050
 who will not be signed according to the article 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.300
 111 of the Criminal Code, the president will receive 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.730
 from 10 to 15 years in prison 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:21.600
 hands at the prison however later yatsenyuk 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.610
 had to back down we put off 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.160
 while signing the economic section 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.190
 of this document taking into account 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.410
 experiencing concerns will not zone 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 free trade to negative 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.750
 implications for industrialized regions 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.330
 because when you analyze the pros and cons 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.370
 realizing that it is easier said than done 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.620
 contradiction is getting bigger and by 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.150
 Apparently with the so-called new 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.520
 Government do not agree, and have already 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.470
 almost everything from Kiev we also 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.810
 heard a promise to join nato and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.190
 get as many weapons from 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.050
 Alliance member countries 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.790
 the Supreme Council was introduced 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.380
 registered bill of 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.900
 resume integration process 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.280
 Ukraine in nato 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.260
 need to provide as much as possible 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.210
 materiel and technical 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.810
 support the form of modern military 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.570
 equipment and weapons and again yatsenyuku 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.980
 I had to take my words back 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.780
 solely for the sake of unity 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.120
 of Ukraine 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.690
 the question of joining NATO is not on 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.690
 the agenda 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.280
 What about the promise to ban Russian 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:36.500
 language i will leave in the hall danik number one i 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.599
 I want to I want to Ukrainian 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.940
 young people spoke no Russian she 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.460
 English this will be my priority 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.099
 task i want to not go to europe 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.660
 Here is my task often but also in Europe and tse 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:55.330
 Our task no one attempts to your 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:59.479
 the right to freely use the Russian language 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.729
 Russian language according to this law in 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.780
 all areas where prevail 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.400
 Russian speakers 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.919
 It has the status of regional and dry your and 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.479
 de facto official language with such 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.690
 same opportunities and rights 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:17.300
 as his Ukrainian it was a U-turn 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.520
 180 degrees this speech is strong 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.919
 contrasted with previous statements 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.020
 and cynic further at some point was 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.110
 announced the introduction of a visa regime with 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.110
 Russia 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.560
 national security council and 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.240
 Defense has decided to introduce 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.940
 visa regime with Russia 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.000
 this decision was rejected and entirely on 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.740
 Ukraine should not be the next day 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280
 hurry with the introduction of the visa regime with 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.560
 Russia 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.750
 here you need to measure seven times and one 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.940
 cut off almost a month has passed since 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.159
 the moment as Yatsenyuk took over as prime minister 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.229
 Ukraine however during this time he never 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.509
 showed what is capable besides threats 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.550
 he can't do that 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.259
 the question is whether it will 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.569
 long-term policy is the same 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.580
 non-permanent and will it be as often 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.259
 as now take your words back 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.259
