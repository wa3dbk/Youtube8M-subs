but<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.759> needs<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> open<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> be

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
but it needs to be open to be to be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
but it needs to be open to be to be
accessible<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.189> close<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.000> show

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
accessible if it's close you can show

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
accessible if it's close you can show
them<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> wine<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.890> need<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
them you can see the wine so you need to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.690 
them you can see the wine so you need to
be<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.580> open<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.070> dependably<00:02:02.490> or

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
be a bit open but it is dependably or

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
be a bit open but it is dependably or
something<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.150> more<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.509> less<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:04.320> open

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
something it's more or less more open

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:19.090 
something it's more or less more open
let's<00:02:05.340> test

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.600 

right<00:02:20.100> away<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.730> about<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.210> wine<00:02:21.410> is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
right away what I like about the wine is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.070 
right away what I like about the wine is
it<00:02:23.610> starts<00:02:24.000> off<00:02:24.150> very<00:02:24.180> slowly<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.960> then<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it starts off very slowly and then it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.640 
it starts off very slowly and then it
goes

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
goes

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.580 
goes
it<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.430> takes<00:02:26.670> off<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.660> long<00:02:27.960> dance

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
it just takes off and it's long dance

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550 
it just takes off and it's long dance
good<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.550> City<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.510> tannins<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.290> very

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
good is City the tannins are very very

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.200 
good is City the tannins are very very
polished<00:02:32.130> yeah<00:02:32.700> sure

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
polished yeah sure

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.840 
polished yeah sure
this<00:02:33.690> type<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.900> wine<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.380> very<00:02:34.410> dynamic<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
this type of wine is very dynamic it's a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.540 
this type of wine is very dynamic it's a
thing<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.540> visit<00:02:37.230> integer<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.010> acidity<00:02:38.460> in

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
thing of visit integer so acidity in

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.980 
thing of visit integer so acidity in
school<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.090> yeah<00:02:39.210> very<00:02:39.390> dynamic<00:02:39.780> wine<00:02:39.960> oh

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
school and so yeah very dynamic wine oh

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.800 
school and so yeah very dynamic wine oh
it's<00:02:40.230> good<00:02:40.380> tension<00:02:40.940> very<00:02:41.940> energetic<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.600> fact

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it's good tension very energetic in fact

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's good tension very energetic in fact
and<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.290> when<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.070> take<00:02:44.190> even<00:02:44.370> mouse<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:45.090> going

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and so when you take even mouse is going

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.270 
and so when you take even mouse is going
on<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.160> on

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
on going on and going on and going on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.460 
on going on and going on and going on
and<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.580> speak<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> box

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.900 
and it speak to you or in all the box
and<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.130> very<00:02:50.310> important<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:50.760> his

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and so it's very important for his

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
and so it's very important for his
vintage<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.660> after<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> see<00:02:52.830> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
vintage and after you can see the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.590 
vintage and after you can see the
concentration<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> wine<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> tannin

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
concentration of the wine and the tannin

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.110 
concentration of the wine and the tannin
just<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.590> texture<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.310> tannin<00:02:56.610> for<00:02:57.030> me

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
just the texture of the tannin for me

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
just the texture of the tannin for me
it's<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.270> important<00:02:57.930> he's<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.890> talent

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's very important he's the talent

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.100 
it's very important he's the talent
should<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.850> polished<00:03:00.120> very<00:03:00.480> soft<00:03:00.989> very<00:03:03.110> velvet

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
should be polished very soft very velvet

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.890 
should be polished very soft very velvet
it's<00:03:04.950> very<00:03:05.310> important<00:03:05.670> because<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.510> shape<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
it's very important because the shape of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.170 
it's very important because the shape of
the<00:03:07.020> Talon<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.910> on

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the Talon go on

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.699 
the Talon go on
all<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.480> life<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> wine<00:03:10.020> if<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.470> right

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
all the life of the wine if it's right

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.130 
all the life of the wine if it's right
now<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.580> should<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.790> dry<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.090> 10<00:03:12.660> years<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.050> 20

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
now it should be dry in 10 years and 20

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.860 
now it should be dry in 10 years and 20
years<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.070> valid<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:14.520> now<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.510> should<00:03:15.750> be

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
years if it's valid at now it should be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.180 
years if it's valid at now it should be
well<00:03:16.020> been<00:03:16.200> vetted<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.500> 10<00:03:16.709> years<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.100> 20

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
well been vetted in 10 years and 20

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.550 
well been vetted in 10 years and 20
years
