underneath why he's dis after he
disarmed<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.270> spawn<00:02:08.600> behind<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:12.340> trying<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
disarmed so I spawn behind in trying to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
disarmed so I spawn behind in trying to
get<00:02:13.550> him<00:02:13.700> here<00:02:13.910> again<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.900> Maps<00:02:15.140> pretty<00:02:15.380> cool

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590

get him here again this Maps pretty cool
squad<00:02:15.920> rush<00:02:16.130> also<00:02:16.550> when<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.910> respawn<00:02:17.450> I'm

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
squad rush also when you respawn I'm

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.500 
squad rush also when you respawn I'm
pretty<00:02:18.530> close<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.010> target<00:02:22.330> seems<00:02:23.330> like

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
pretty close to the target seems like

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.550 
pretty close to the target seems like
the<00:02:23.630> target<00:02:23.989> stay<00:02:25.150> available<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.810> disarm<00:02:27.320> for

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the target stay available to disarm for

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.330 
the target stay available to disarm for
a<00:02:27.590> while<00:02:27.770> also<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:30.500> gotta<00:02:30.680> defend<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.190> well

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
a while also really gotta defend it well

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.330 
a while also really gotta defend it well
have<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> good<00:02:31.910> plan<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:33.470> guy<00:02:33.680> underneath<00:02:33.920> on

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
have a good plan one guy underneath on

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.690 
have a good plan one guy underneath on
this<00:02:34.730> map<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.150> good<00:02:35.360> idea<00:02:35.390> also<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.580> can

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
this map is a good idea also so you can

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.900 
this map is a good idea also so you can
always<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.970> arm<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:38.690> disarm<00:02:39.700> maybe<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.820> little

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
always a arm or disarm maybe a little

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.510 
always a arm or disarm maybe a little
patch<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.360> out<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.690> them<00:02:42.130> Charlie<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.220> spot

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
patch that out of them Charlie I spot

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.660 
patch that out of them Charlie I spot
him<00:02:46.030> networks<00:02:47.030> keep<00:02:48.019> them<00:02:48.140> away<00:02:48.320> from

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
him networks keep them away from

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.770 
him networks keep them away from
disarming

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
disarming

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.270 
disarming
so<00:02:51.780> I'll<00:02:51.840> keep<00:02:51.990> circling<00:02:52.319> around<00:02:52.560> using<00:02:53.099> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so I'll keep circling around using the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.199 
so I'll keep circling around using the
m416<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.980> salt<00:02:55.980> class<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:57.060> should

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
m416 on a salt class and we should

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.120 
m416 on a salt class and we should
destroy<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.270> get<00:03:00.480> 20<00:03:00.840> more<00:03:01.130> tickets

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
destroy so now we get 20 more tickets

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.880 
destroy so now we get 20 more tickets
here<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:03.510> go<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> second<00:03:04.410> bomb<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.830> a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
here to go get the second bomb it's a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.860 
here to go get the second bomb it's a
little<00:03:05.040> more<00:03:05.160> trickier<00:03:05.640> I'm<00:03:06.390> always<00:03:06.630> trying

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
little more trickier I'm always trying

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.020 
little more trickier I'm always trying
to<00:03:07.020> flank<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.770> way<00:03:07.890> around<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
to flank all the way around on the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.120 
to flank all the way around on the
outside<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.810> can't<00:03:10.170> go<00:03:10.319> yet<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.590> forgot<00:03:10.950> you

outside I can't go yet I forgot you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
outside I can't go yet I forgot you
gotta<00:03:11.280> wait<00:03:11.489> 30<00:03:11.790> seconds<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:15.420> know<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.020> we<00:03:16.080> can

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
gotta wait 30 seconds I know how we can

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.070 
gotta wait 30 seconds I know how we can
you<00:03:16.350> move<00:03:16.470> up<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.970> also<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.330> better<00:03:18.750> mode

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
you move up this is also a better mode

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.809 
you move up this is also a better mode
to<00:03:19.260> play<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.860> don't<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.310> playing<00:03:20.519> rush

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
to play if you don't like playing rush

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.320 
to play if you don't like playing rush
or<00:03:21.030> 25<00:03:21.510> minutes<00:03:21.930> sometimes<00:03:23.180> sometimes<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
or 25 minutes sometimes sometimes you

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.550 
or 25 minutes sometimes sometimes you
can<00:03:24.450> make<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.690> shorter<00:03:24.989> than<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.410> had<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
can make it shorter than if you had a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.309 
can make it shorter than if you had a
really<00:03:25.769> successful<00:03:26.600> march<00:03:27.600> towards<00:03:27.959> all<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
really successful march towards all the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.789 
really successful march towards all the
bombs<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.410> bit<00:03:31.680> better

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
bombs but this is a little bit better

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.940 
bombs but this is a little bit better
moda<00:03:32.630> seems<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.019> average<00:03:34.260> about<00:03:34.709> five

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
moda seems like the average about five

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.100 
moda seems like the average about five
minutes<00:03:35.250> five<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.819> half<00:03:35.850> minutes<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.989> if

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
minutes five and a half minutes so if

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.390 
minutes five and a half minutes so if

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
you have squad rush give it a try it's
