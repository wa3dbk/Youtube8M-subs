00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 The people today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.480
 how to make the anamorphic filter is to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 give that fired luiz in the picture 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 well first you should have any 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 Black leaf type second one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.750
 Filter the size of the thread, right? 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 that the diameter of your lens 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 in my case I use a 72 minutes 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 you will also need to use a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.660
 right scissor 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 the advisor that I use this one is not a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 tip 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.520
 I will tell you here though and also use maps 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.280
 I can not score and we hate to score 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.820
 filter size on the sheet of paper 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.820
 black 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.860
 gil plus also use the nylon line that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 and the most important 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.060
 this line should not be missing if you 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.820
 make your filter ok i bought this one 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 equipo 10 cents or meter and two meters 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.640
 and you can make multiple filters there 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.310
 and another fundamental thing that should not 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.729
 The lens is certainly not in my 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 case that I'm using in with the 180 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.659
 2.8 mm and let's go 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.280
 start to do is this filter, shall we? 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.280
 see if it really works 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.110
 well first you must put there is 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:06.020
 the filter on the black sheet and right 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.320
 start circulating this filter with your 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.850
 lap mark the ally where you go 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.290
 cut the wire is where you will cut the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.310
 leaf 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.900
 mark very well even you will have to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.900
 to leave the perfect had 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.950
 here I think it's already 100 legal and it's 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.250
 the second step is you cut it there 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.630
 sheet it you can cut straight 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:52.970
 she is in the right measure 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:56.290
 careful for me to ruin the thesis ruin 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.290
 circular shape 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.970
 here I think it's cool and then 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.080
 you should fold the circular sheet in 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.350
 make this drawing in the shape of an eye 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.710
 is on the sheet and then fold and begins to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.870
 cut and you will see that you now only 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.640
 end up wanting to cut 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:55.120
 You'll see, more or less, it started. 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:58.450
 until stay is the result 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.880
 mine was the one here but I might be smaller 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.070
 in your case I do not have much 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.980
 practice and make the first filter 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.180
 What am I doing and right after you? 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.900
 should pick up the prevailing nylon 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.560
 to measure or to pick up is the fusion I am 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.290
 black belt about the size 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.410
 that I'll stay there the job I already have 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.840
 what a kiss on the leaf 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:32.080
 soon after you cut him and 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.160
 paste after as can be with cola glue 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.830
 Warm, ne'er 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.370
 is a good option you can use too 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.210
 durex as it was the case that I improvised a 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.450
 Little did you and it went this way that never 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.520
 had this result but you can paste 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.490
 in different ways since he is 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 lose as long as you look good chicane 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.220
 then you take the one in this circle 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.370
 you cut simply fit into the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.160
 filter your camera in case here we already 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.850
 I spoke in the beginning of the year and two boys 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.900
 or I cut this role fits here 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.850
 perfectly in the nifty movie 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.040
 this is a case of you not fitting 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.690
 perfectly leaving do not have a 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.150
 result with me 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.970
 is what happens with some kind of glue 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.370
 hot on the edges, not in boxes or 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.830
 camera but in case it fit right 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.700
 so I'll need to use any kind of 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.650
 glue and this progress treatment 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.130
 now I'm going to fit it, it's not so much 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:41.230
 for you a little notion of how it is 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.590
 only oak in bed I'm more 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.590
 stay at home 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.830
 This was the result of the son I made 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.569
 and now you will see the 10 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.569
 It's with this filter, thanks.
