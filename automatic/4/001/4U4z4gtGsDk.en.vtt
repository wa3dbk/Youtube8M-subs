00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.120
 once water as was distributed 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.100
 continue with me regarding the workshop as 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.110
 you know in the expensive frame the house of 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.929
 auctions or the first edition of the 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.029
 card game that blue spectral tiger 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.460
 precious this week in which 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.150
 very much from the previous video to this one 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.039
 only 24 houses waste but good is 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.349
 that I was starting to do a 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.480
 little uphill and I decided to slow down a 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.730
 a little bit, well, if not 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.199
 I know I'm going to end up burning and I 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.390
 will buy the normal spectral tiger 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.199
 It is a mandate to be taken by sack so that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.500
 I have almost 568,000 cesc as well as all 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.720
 the weeks then I'm going to bring today one of 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.489
 what do I do for extras to go to 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.559
 part of my method are the bags already 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.409
 you know but there are always tricks 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.449
 to tease out the extra occasionally 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.580
 this week is going to be the little ruby 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.860
 another pet on the server where I am 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.619
 playing with the alliance is between 12 and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.290
 16 houses normally 16 case will not be 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.689
 level 25 and this pet has taken a 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.300
 Radius of the previous expansion in steel 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.130
 pandaria and down to the right the island 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.610
 timeless once on the timeless island 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.800
 we have 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.810
 we put there where I am there we will have 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.160
 to wait for an albatross to come 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.840
 they are huge seagulls that go 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.970
 flying around when you approach him 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.160
 we hit a very soft tap to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.070
 distance and it will catch us and it will take us 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.770
 to walk after two hours of walk 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.080
 two hours not quite there either 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.450
 I have there is a keko of the achieved that a 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.520
 level 90 I have it dead laughing and what 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.890
 I have there the normal one for what I said 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.510
 can a long while flying we will arrive at a 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.729
 red lake on top of a mountain of 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.400
 show the map when we are on top 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.740
 of water we will kill albatrosses that we can 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.479
 hit here is the movement of everything that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 we will do on the water and we will be in the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.160
 point of which I am now here can 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.009
 appear a radar of this radius that 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.619
 embody that you have 3 percent of 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.750
 possibilities to get us this pet is 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.600
 a weird that has 166 thousand life of 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.810
 level 91 that's why with a 90 you can 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.660
 kill well and if you ever catch me 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.270
 bushes has between 30 and 45 minutes more or 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.880
 less than reappear if you get it right 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.400
 the response can kill you many 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.530
 times in a row but it's having there 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
 get to kill him and then go out to the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.520
 half an hour to the home and be waiting 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.490
 be and until it reappears to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.260
 to kill that again is to catch him 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.180
 with time or at dawn when there is no 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.790
 nobody playing entering the place if you can 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.590
 when in the morning when you get up and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.660
 nothing to kill him and to be lucky to is a 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.120
 pretty rare pet get and for 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.300
 that 's what the auction house does 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.880
 it's hard to sell has to get the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.920
 person who wants the pet when you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.540
 pet in the cheapest of all me 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.910
 it costs time to sell but when it 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.710
 sells is a good chute to our 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.050
 amount of arm so nothing I hope 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.130
 that the video serves you or like it and tomorrow 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.130
 more until tomorrow
