00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 the opinion of the weapons and yourself how and 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.109
 when did you learn the news in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 time when I got myself when I got 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.630
 woke up I had a mathieu text 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 darche then told me it was that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 was ending so it's a good morning yes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 it's true one good morning you can 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.050
 smile finds hope 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.520
 you waited for a while 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.449
 that's because I imagine we're going through too 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 by all moods 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 in the meantime it is to know one day 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 tell us yes it will resume lombard 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 we do not it's not sure there is a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.090
 month it was not close enough 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.910
 so I was never able to wait 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 then play here and then when someone 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 that I was going to have the new room is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 good news so a little too much 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 stress on this side it's true that the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 Quebec media especially one was very 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 careful because on December 5 said 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 david we went very close to a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 okay so we were very positive yesterday 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 evening when we were going 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 sleep but we were cautious of your 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.750
 side you said it's mathieu darche 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.090
 so your teammate there are networks 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.980
 of players it is the agents of joy or 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.570
 between players we spent the news 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.400
 how did you live this period 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 as in transit and training to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.330
 across the ocean 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.480
 the application on his back hiller who that 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.940
 John did not give us any disorders 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.150
 tasks whenever that is 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.210
 need then we the canadians we had 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.990
 a little cat together on what's app 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.790
 then we kept abreast of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.680
 development then things like that 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 I want now to give him your 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.240
 bag is already ready you are going to leave us 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.710
 and that in quotation marks already had in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 the pocket not yet but 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.070
 probably Tuesday or probably said 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.930
 we see them worth the problem with 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.369
 with the organization for the departure of 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.750
 david kern and that's the big point 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.430
 interrogation because we know that the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.500
 new season can begin 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.040
 only once the camps have 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.560
 place it's an obligation actually 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.820
 in organizing a nhl season 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.360
 setting up a camp 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 preparation 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.800
 good in fact there are always limits 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 usually these three weeks four 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.520
 weeks we can not go anymore 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 long while 2 compared to the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 Switzerland where the other 15 and we have 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.440
 remedied his courses there are a lot of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
 preparation matches and then there 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.000
 go and for the lockout season they say 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.800
 always a minimum of one week 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 so that's just a bit of a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.430
 little question mark because 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.110
 the many Canadian media and 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.040
 Quebecers who were the crane 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.870
 on the side of new york 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.520
 no American media so to believe that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 it only interested Canadians on 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.540
 lock out was present in new york and the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.890
 speculation is going well 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.570
 the question mark is precisely 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 repatriate all those players who are 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.420
 come evolved in europe and well the most 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.160
 optimists leans for Wednesday 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.470
 it's frankly realistic for you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.510
 of recent games reviews said that would be 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.610
 a little early but at the same time 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.200
 think it still leaves us in 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.459
 exhuming so it does not leave three days 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.410
 to see to repatriate everyone 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.830
 so I think it's feasible or 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.830
 it's at the same time
