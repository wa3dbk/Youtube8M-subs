00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 video for des android dotcom today os 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.040
 we want to present a terminal of the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.259
 zte brand is a low-end terminal 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.590
 specifically it's about the zte skate 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.530
 prom 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.390
 what is this that we have here and it comes 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.670
 of a good terminal because with some 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 characteristics as good low-end 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.380
 if in the first place we find 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.120
 a 4 inch screen as you can 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.540
 see that every time to be a camera 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.640
 low is very interesting 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.970
 has a rear camera of 5 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.440
 megapixels and does not have a camera 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.720
 front to make video calls with 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.670
 which is good because you can not use it 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.350
 for that and then already regarding the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.330
 good hardware then we found that 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.160
 this terminal has a processor 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.470
 from a mono core to a gigahertz 512 mb 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.300
 of ram memory and only 2 of 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.580
 internal storage is worth it is true 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.550
 It is having an expansion through 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.210
 memory card up to 32 gb but 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.660
 good 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.030
 in principle it only includes 2 gb of 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.369
 internal storage and in the box 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.210
 can you find a sd card sorry 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.479
 micro sd of 4 gigas of course available 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.880
 of wifi and gps bluetooth and also 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.190
 Supports dlna who knows how to find a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.979
 low-end terminal that support this 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.140
 standard good so in this case z you what 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.790
 has included 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 and regarding the operation of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.430
 phone well, yes it is true that 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.430
 has surprised us because despite the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.870
 It's the characteristics that it has good 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 well, the performance it gives is pretty 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 well you see that it is quite fluid 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.050
 you notice them in no time 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.590
 is able to play videos at 720 without 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.590
 problems 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.280
 it does not cost him any work to do it in 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280
 as for the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.100
 to the good system well if it comes with 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.140
 android 404 voucher 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.430
 we see each other says they already take you out 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 update you know there are two 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.830
 versions already above 4.1 and 4.2 but 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.930
 good in principle because the phone then 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.210
 nothing is that it behaves for what it is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 pretty good alright let's make a 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.830
 navigation test so you can see 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.870
 of what I think the terminal is capable of 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.709
 if we accept 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.709
 the session 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.680
 made the markers we have for 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.680
 here 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.300
 we have the ball of chasms 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 first enter our blog is worth to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.490
 that you can see look for the speed of 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.590
 load and other remains is that it is quite 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.280
 pretty good the blog is already loaded and 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.140
 Well, the scroll goes without any type 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.500
 of problems with installs without 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.840
 problems has fluid father is not going to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.880
 Assume no type of lock at the time 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.770
 to be able to surf the internet 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.020
 and as what best demonstrates what 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.320
 it's a terminal are the mets farc so if 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.550
 it seems you 're going to pass the quadrant 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.080
 it's good for you to see good then a little 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.080
 the score that goes from this terminal 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.629
 and what is capable if we see that it takes 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.360
 a lot we will cut the video to not have 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.990
 keep waiting for the time it takes the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.490
 benchmark 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.070
 but well we do not want it to be 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.740
 very much more let the phone 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.120
 feed who passes the test 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.120
 and we do not see the return 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.100
 good as you can see it's over 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:01.690
 of 20 and well the score that 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.470
 has given us if the chair I see around here is 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.580
 of 1888 points 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.670
 remember that it is a low-end terminal 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.830
 we can no longer compare it with dwellings and 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.210
 s3 or which was finished but 1800 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.710
 points for a terminal of these 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.720
 characteristics the truth is that it is 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.340
 Frankly, look carefully, it is 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.409
 on top of the 7 h that although it's a 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.919
 old model was a high- end model 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.089
 ok that's what we have left like the work that 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.529
 we have done before regarding the 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:30.050
 phone materials has 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.449
 surprised that despite being manufactured 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.669
 in plastic materials because here there are 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.760
 that being part of here this framework is 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.400
 chrome plated 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.220
 gives a feeling of robustness that has 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.870
 pleased the back is like a 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.270
 It has special like rubber 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.130
 very very fine in a kind of rubber that 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.660
 gives us a good grip but it is true 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.630
 that the phone's finishes have 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.520
 left more than satisfied because good 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.950
 think it's a low-end terminal 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.000
 I think the design and the finishes are 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.400
 extremely good 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.710
 ok then this is all for the moment 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.940
 we keep watching in future videos 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.940
 greetings soon
