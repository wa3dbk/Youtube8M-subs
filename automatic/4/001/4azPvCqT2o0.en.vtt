like<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.880> modular<00:01:56.130> synthesizer<00:01:57.130> for<00:01:57.700> making

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
like a a modular synthesizer for making

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.570 
like a a modular synthesizer for making
visuals<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.930> just<00:01:59.410> like<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.560> modular<00:02:00.130> analog

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
visuals so just like a modular analog

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.940 
visuals so just like a modular analog
synthesizer<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.540> have<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.930> lot<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.350> freedom<00:02:02.649> to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
synthesizer you have a lot of freedom to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.940 
synthesizer you have a lot of freedom to
plug<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:04.060> know<00:02:04.149> this<00:02:04.479> controller<00:02:05.140> into<00:02:05.710> that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
plug you know this controller into that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.820 
plug you know this controller into that
receiver<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.180> modulate<00:02:07.960> one<00:02:08.229> signal<00:02:08.679> with

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
receiver and modulate one signal with

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.850 
receiver and modulate one signal with
another<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.179> possibilities<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.899> vdmx<00:02:11.620> are
