00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.390
 we are listening to the voice of paola 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.519
 bassano reporter 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.870
 that is in place and the 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.269
 situation is 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.750
 it is turning more violent with 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.939
 tear gas throwing a lot 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.180
 movement and it seems that the serenazgo 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.860
 and the police are trying to recover 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.760
 at this time 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.850
 the terrain invaded and push back 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.600
 the invaders who throw stones with a 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 difficult agreement for 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.570
 the team that is in place 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.170
 we removed the situation and the brand we have 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.890
 conversed with Luis the mayor of 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.050
 chosica there is a conflict by limits to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.170
 also of course the issue of 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.660
 the invasion of those from the lands of 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.870
 private land is also the subject 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.059
 of the limits although the mayor good 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.619
 has assured that this area belongs to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.530
 lurigancho chosica and is not part of the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.200
 province of Huarochiri as the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.210
 authorities of san antonio are 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.210
 making some villagers believe 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.290
 we have another camera too 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 that I do not know 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.260
 the first screen shows us the same 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.440
 the start of the confrontation of how 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.730
 started this situation and what is 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.730
 happening live 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.600
 we heard screams 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.080
 of villagers who are also being 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 affected by a situation that they have not 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.880
 generated 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.200
 the the villagers who live in the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 adjoining houses 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.640
 of the invaders then we try 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 to advance 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.670
 stay in that desire 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:42.070
 in the area adjacent to the land in 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.070
 precisely disputes the land 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.140
 the national police with shields with 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.940
 tear gas bombs with the support of 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 serenazgo of chosica eye because 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.240
 it's just a conflict of 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.240
 limits there is a conflict of limits 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.010
 that according to was late me and that's good 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 does not have no sense because this 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.790
 Wigan area belongs to it is 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 say to your jurisdiction and not to the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 province of huarochirÃ­ as they maintain 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.790
 The authorities 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.239
 the investors had changed 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.360
 or as you pointed out a and well would 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.100
 well, a political intention behind 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.840
 this 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.840
 get votes for the future 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.290
 the invaded land seems to be 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.370
 He has calmed down a little 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.370
 the situation 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.170
 it seems that she the police has 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.060
 controlled the disputed area so 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 we can 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.540
 so we can see what it is 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.310
 precisely that is a not the area of 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.310
 front of this avenue 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.310
 in the camera 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.810
 with the cynic then 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.880
 then it was returned 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.430
 thanks to the mediation of the police station 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.430
 I knew of a police station of its size 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.690
 but this situation as I pointed out 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.430
 has continued and has become more 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.300
 violent when the police 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.130
 and members of the serenazgo have reached 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.760
 place to recover the land 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.950
 invaded there is also a problem already 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.360
 as we have reported even with 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.270
 interview to Luis the mayor of 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.870
 chosica there is a food problem of 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.980
 bordering 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.530
 that the mayor considers 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.530
 there is or is not new there why
