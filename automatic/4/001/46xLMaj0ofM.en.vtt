00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.570
 hello very good today we bring you a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.310
 review of a signature guitar fender 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.800
 telecaster in this case is from 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.570
 most known richie kotzen guitarist 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.279
 as for being the guitarist of the group 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.190
 mister I saw that formerly of poison 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.920
 apart from being a great guitarist 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 lonely has a great career as 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 you see it's a telecaster 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.629
 like a very nice stage of art 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.300
 flamed in finished a body of ash 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.620
 as the lbs the current in all 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.530
 3 techniques depends 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.790
 the most you have completely maple to 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.820
 same as the fretboard 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.160
 the shape of cee masts of 12 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.990
 inches which means it's a 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.250
 pretty thick mast and remembering 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.920
 much to a sun sports 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.230
 the frets also look like 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.680
 gibson are jumbo type are 22 frets in 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 total 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.930
 As you will see, all the fittings are 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.490
 gilded headstock is a very vote 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.700
 precise that holds very well the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.700
 tuning 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.220
 and now we go with the majors 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 peculiarities of this guitar that in 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 this case mounts some pills of the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.750
 Marcio's house a villa in it 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.560
 on the mast and on the bridge has a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.869
 super double-lane temps that pretty 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.759
 sugar cane the selector is of three positions 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.009
 standard like all technical ter 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.649
 has a single control of one for both 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.939
 pills and here's the biggest 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.649
 peculiarity of this guitar since in 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.750
 instead of having here the tone lacks 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.939
 tone and what we have is a switch 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.850
 two positions with a switch that what 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.579
 What it does to us is change the pills to 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.100
 But what does this mean? 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.580
 that both the mast pickup and the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 of bridge does not interfere with anything asked 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.780
 but when we put it in the mix of 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.099
 both castillas then we can put that 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.410
 the mix is seriously parallel is 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.989
 say that this pill I had as a single 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.540
 or act as a bouquet if you 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.400
 we put in a mode a booker so 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.590
 we are doing is that we would have three 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 pills playing sounding at the same time 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 what we would get a pretty sound 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 pretty good 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.430
 and
