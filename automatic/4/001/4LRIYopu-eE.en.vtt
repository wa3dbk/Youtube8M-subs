00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659

look right just never if I had known

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.260 
look right just never if I had known
that<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.590> an<00:01:19.039> anagram<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.520> Larry<00:01:19.850> Niven

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
I would have actually done the piece

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.340 
I would have actually done the piece
differently<00:01:23.420> because<00:01:23.539> I'm<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:23.929> big<00:01:24.140> fan<00:01:24.319> of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
differently because I'm a big fan of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.540 
differently because I'm a big fan of
Larry<00:01:24.619> Niven<00:01:26.830> well<00:01:27.830> at<00:01:27.890> least<00:01:27.950> for<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.190> time<00:01:28.220> it

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
Larry Niven well at least for a time it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.760 
Larry Niven well at least for a time it
was<00:01:28.670> mine<00:01:28.880> Sabbath<00:01:29.330> role<00:01:29.569> because<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:30.440> kind<00:01:30.740> of

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
was mine Sabbath role because it kind of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.950 
was mine Sabbath role because it kind of
came<00:01:30.950> out<00:01:31.039> exactly<00:01:31.429> how<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.270> came<00:01:32.450> out<00:01:32.569> I<00:01:32.600> want

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
came out exactly how it came out I want

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.590 
came out exactly how it came out I want
it<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.170> my<00:01:33.259> head<00:01:33.789> this<00:01:34.789> is<00:01:34.970> my<00:01:35.149> instead<00:01:35.420> throw

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
it in my head this is my instead throw

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.930 
it in my head this is my instead throw
but<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.929> it's<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.289> different<00:01:36.470> one<00:01:36.679> from<00:01:37.460> a

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
but it's a it's a different one from a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.070 
but it's a it's a different one from a
later<00:01:38.119> set<00:01:38.420> but<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.950> early<00:01:40.520> piece<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.840> wasn't

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
later set but that early piece it wasn't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.540 
later set but that early piece it wasn't
the<00:01:42.140> most<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:42.440> complicated<00:01:43.190> or<00:01:43.369> well

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
the most like complicated or well

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.150 
the most like complicated or well
painted<00:01:43.910> but<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.209> just<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.720> one<00:01:44.899> that

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
painted but it's just the one that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.919 
painted but it's just the one that
seemed<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.250> come<00:01:46.429> out<00:01:46.459> the<00:01:46.670> way<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:46.819> I<00:01:47.450> wanted

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
seemed to come out the way that I wanted
