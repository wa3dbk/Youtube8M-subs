00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello everyone are various of the blog www.bo 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.179
 china superfine dot com is today vi 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.310
 I tell a very good pasta 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 the pasta is very simple and very fast 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 alla gricia pasta alla gricia 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.949
 someone claims to be the forerunner 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 of pasta all'amatriciana 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.840
 let's say a red is complementary 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.849
 and a white one are all very simple and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.279
 two take very little foresight 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.550
 good ingredients a smile in the kitchen and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.399
 we are going to prepare prepare the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.440
 gricia we need short pasta or 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 spaghetti in the recipe version 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
 Spaghetti se were traditional 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 use short pasta, choose rigatoni 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 delicate open cans because in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 this way the seasoning sticks for 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.910
 well in which i need to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.500
 pillow that the pillow does not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.420
 pancetta if you don't find the pillow 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.439
 choose bacon that is enough 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 fat ground black pepper of course ne 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.170
 it will serve much less than this but in short 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.360
 this is this use and quite a lot of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.119
 pecorino romano which will serve at the end 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 already grated and keep them for a while 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.110
 part to scratch 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.540
 calculating doses all people we will have 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.850
 need 200 grams of pasta and 100 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 grams of pork cheek which we will then go to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.890
 prepare then we start preparing the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.140
 then cheek in a pan 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 quite high and non-stick 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 at the beginning they were used 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 the iron limpets that today 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 completely they are no longer 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.180
 we put a teaspoon of oil and a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.369
 little bit of pepper in flakes and we do it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.649
 heat the moment it will be 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.869
 heated c pour all the pillow 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.840
 in the meantime let's boil too 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.159
 the water with very little salt very little 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.659
 because the pillow develops tasty 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.369
 when and they are thrown in there hot 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.549
 all the pillow we cut 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.860
 just to give it we brown it there 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.750
 we realize that it is ready when 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.240
 then it begins to change color 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 30 transparencies pulls out a lot 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.040
 fat so let's focus enough 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.130
 medium high it will take 73 minutes not it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.450
 we turn itself but do not mix a 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.750
 simply dividing the pan 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.220
 we turn celebrations to the pan 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.110
 as you see , asshole pillow has 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 pulled out the grease and color changed 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.100
 so we put it aside while 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.440
 we prepare the pasta when the water boils 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.060
 make all the pasta region and the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.600
 let's cook 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.880
 remember that something vascular three 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.620
 minutes 2 3 minutes ahead of time 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.450
 indicated on the package remains 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
 otherwise it becomes practically yes 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.709
 shakes and becomes inedible 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.630
 above all it does not bind or with pillows e 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.760
 we montecolino so we work the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.430
 drain 23 minutes before and then 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.620
 keep remembering another thing 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.620
 before I forget before I drain it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 set aside about half a glass 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.780
 of pasta cooking water because 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.510
 you will need it if the result 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.340
 final was not homogeneous enough 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.560
 the pasta is cooked listen to three minutes 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.989
 but the verse directly into the pot 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.000
 in the pan where he is watching e 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.500
 mixes using a certainty and a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.209
 spoon 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.590
 at this point I add a little bit 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.019
 of pasta cooking water 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.549
 directly 4 this because in this 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:39.180
 way allow the pasta friend of 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.590
 thicken seasoning so here it comes 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.340
 the beautiful pecorino romano and I throw it down 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.870
 in abundance and pepper that ugly with 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.230
 caution because then I will also put them 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.230
 well above compounds 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.860
 and I think I still need a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.850
 little bit of cooking water because 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.670
 it does not seem enough to me 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.220
 mixed up realize how much you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.590
 life should not be liquidated as 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.269
 you work outside the gate is necessary 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:26.900
 that all movements are cannoli 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:29.540
 carmatic this is a final result a 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.330
 Flat add much more parmi 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.990
 pecorino and parmesan elsewhere corino e 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.790
 more pepper and taste away I know you see 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.650
 the joy of my mini eyes but they are 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.360
 just happy with the result 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.340
 so before I taste it I do it 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.680
 the last thing I need to add 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.930
 still pecorino 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.290
 I feel like a very good perfume 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.960
 you say black pepper does not exaggerate for per 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.010
 my king cheek was quite spicy 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.890
 so do you 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.310
 and then taste because so much that the 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.310
 final purpose 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.080
 successful test is perfect or gray 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.840
 pecorino pepe marry very well 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.560
 great clip on try me let me 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.800

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.230
