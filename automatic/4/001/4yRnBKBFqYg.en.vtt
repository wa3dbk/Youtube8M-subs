00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
connection with and then it's just these

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780

girls<00:04:04.080> are<00:04:04.320> being<00:04:04.350> taken<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.130> then<00:04:05.280> their

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
girls are being taken and then their

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.699 
girls are being taken and then their
souls<00:04:06.330> are<00:04:06.450> sucked<00:04:06.690> but<00:04:06.870> they're<00:04:07.019> raped<00:04:07.230> first

but<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.610> feel<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.750> wasn't<00:04:14.000> appropriate

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
but I feel like it wasn't appropriate

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.930 
but I feel like it wasn't appropriate
because<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.900> first<00:04:16.109> book<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.680> don't<00:04:17.640> know<00:04:17.730> I
