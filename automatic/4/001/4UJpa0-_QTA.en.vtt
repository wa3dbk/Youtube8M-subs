Samsung Galaxy s2 the petition Ram is is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.400 
Samsung Galaxy s2 the petition Ram is is
really<00:00:24.779> fast<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.670> but<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> it's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
really fast and but as you see it it's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.560 
really fast and but as you see it it's
really<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.189> different<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:29.849> from

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
really not that different from from

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.380 
really not that different from from
touch<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.059> an

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
touch with it's kind of kind of like an

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.950 
touch with it's kind of kind of like an
upgraded<00:00:34.110> version<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> TouchWiz<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.660> we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
upgraded version of TouchWiz so if we

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.260 
upgraded version of TouchWiz so if we
want<00:00:37.170> something<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.980> looks<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.730> touch

want something that looks like touch
with<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.790> faster<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
with but it's a little faster then you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.240 
with but it's a little faster then you
should<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.899> Batista<00:00:45.899> round<00:00:46.230> let's<00:00:46.890> just

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
should get the Batista round let's just

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
should get the Batista round let's just
take<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> quadrant<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.840> wait<00:00:49.530> once

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
take a quadrant know what wait once

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.119 
take a quadrant know what wait once
again<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.110> overclock<00:00:52.879> this

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
again you can also overclock this

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.840 
again you can also overclock this
overclock<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.160> Samsung<00:00:56.730> ICS<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.719> about

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
take a look at the Linpack run multi

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:53.020 
take a look at the Linpack run multi
thread<00:02:41.019> learning<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:43.840> 100<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:46.390> 99<00:02:49.599> 180<00:02:52.030> yeah

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
thread learning one 100 to 99 180 yeah

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.349 
thread learning one 100 to 99 180 yeah
so<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:53.680> about<00:02:55.900> 110<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.560> you're<00:02:57.829> gonna<00:02:57.950> and

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
so it's about 110 if you're gonna and

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.270 
so it's about 110 if you're gonna and
it's<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.560> really<00:03:00.859> fast

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
it's it's really fast

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.390 
it's it's really fast
and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.940> customize<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.750> as<00:03:02.959> well<00:03:03.400> with

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
and you can customize it as well with

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 
and you can customize it as well with
the<00:03:04.579> rom<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.940> better<00:03:05.150> get<00:03:05.450> metamorph<00:03:06.049> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the rom you better get metamorph that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.479 
the rom you better get metamorph that
allows<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> customize<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.239> do<00:03:09.489> different

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
allows you to customize and do different

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.920 
allows you to customize and do different
stuff<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.380> here<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> got<00:03:12.680> theme<00:03:13.250> settings

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
stuff and here you got theme settings

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.539 
stuff and here you got theme settings
but<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.109> mostly<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
but that's mostly just for the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.620 
but that's mostly just for the
lockscreen<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.700> JK<00:03:19.700> last<00:03:20.180> looks

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
everything is still there you just

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.740 
everything is still there you just
change<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.070> user<00:04:46.730> interface<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.420> some<00:04:47.570> other

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
change the user interface and some other

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.180 
change the user interface and some other
stuff<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.200> little<00:04:49.390> but<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:51.170> can<00:04:51.440> feel<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.950> is

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
stuff a little but you can feel that is

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.380 
stuff a little but you can feel that is
faster<00:04:53.090> everything<00:04:53.840> goes<00:04:54.170> quicker<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:58.390> as

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
faster everything goes quicker and as

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.470 
faster everything goes quicker and as
you<00:04:59.540> see<00:04:59.720> it's<00:05:00.020> cool<00:05:00.290> 3d<00:05:01.010> kind<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:04.480> it's

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
you see it's cool 3d kind of and it's

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.150 
you see it's cool 3d kind of and it's
really<00:05:06.200> nice<00:05:06.350> but<00:05:06.620> if<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.980> overclock<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:09.160> 1.6

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
really nice but if you overclock to 1.6

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.020 
really nice but if you overclock to 1.6
gigahertz<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.800> will<00:05:13.010> easily<00:05:13.280> get<00:05:13.610> really

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
gigahertz then it will easily get really

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.060 
gigahertz then it will easily get really
hot<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:15.170> if<00:05:15.980> you<00:05:16.370> for<00:05:17.150> instance<00:05:17.450> take<00:05:18.070> 1

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
hot so if you for instance take 1

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.280 
hot so if you for instance take 1
gigahertz<00:05:19.370> each<00:05:19.700> processor<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.750> performance

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
gigahertz each processor and performance

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.150 
gigahertz each processor and performance
then<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:23.570> doesn't<00:05:24.140> really<00:05:24.290> affect<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.800> speed

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
then it doesn't really affect the speed

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.510 
then it doesn't really affect the speed
you<00:05:25.550> can<00:05:25.790> still<00:05:26.090> feel<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.510> it's<00:05:26.660> quite<00:05:26.990> fast

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
you can still feel it it's quite fast

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.380 
you can still feel it it's quite fast
you<00:05:28.520> see<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:31.100> know<00:05:31.220> if<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.820> take<00:05:32.090> a<00:05:32.360> if

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
you see but you know if you take a if

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.440 
you see but you know if you take a if
you<00:05:35.390> take<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:36.100> quadrant<00:05:37.100> test<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:38.000> won't<00:05:38.120> get

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
you take a quadrant test you won't get

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.910 
you take a quadrant test you won't get
the<00:05:38.540> same<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:40.040> same<00:05:40.510> results<00:05:41.510> but<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:42.500> still

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
the same the same results but it's still

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.350 
the same the same results but it's still
really<00:05:43.220> nice<00:05:43.490> you<00:05:43.730> can't<00:05:43.940> feel<00:05:44.210> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
really nice you can't feel the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.520 
really nice you can't feel the
difference<00:05:44.720> but<00:05:45.020> it's<00:05:45.170> still<00:05:46.090> may<00:05:47.090> seem<00:05:47.270> it

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
difference but it's still may seem it
