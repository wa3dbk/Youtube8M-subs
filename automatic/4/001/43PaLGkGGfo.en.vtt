00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.190
 hello today we'll see here 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:17.190
 Here is a watch in a nasty flyer 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 ordered with aliexpress somewhere 12 13 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.340
 dollars, that is somewhere 500 550 rubles 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.660
 about an hour and went about a month or 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.670
 a half came in general then in decent 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 condition almost do not give about everything 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 order means most hours 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.200
 Hungarian litton they go such 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879
 mechanical 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.579
 at first glance, everything is done pretty 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.710
 not bad watch drive on have transparent 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.980
 body 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 you can see how the gears are spinning 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.750
 self-winding then there is such a pendulum 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.890
 on this side which is dangling and how 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.400
 would turn on made of such 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 pretty nice looking metal 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.560
 stated that steel or stainless steel is not 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.520
 I know that in fact really 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.439
 done pretty well 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.229
 there is still no shipping film 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 I not yet unpacked to think that way 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:49.040
 you can see about why you can 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.010
 see that all pretty pretty 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.230
 traced 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:01.640
 the clock has pigtails so I'll show you now 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.790
 Here you can see these arrows are but 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 hour minute and second they have 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.210
 white white such at first glance 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.960
 paint on actually on them at all 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.440
 should have been applied like this 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.120
 called phosphorus phosphorus shorter sense 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.540
 in the fact that in the dark you need to glow 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:31.130
 now I will bring the light bulb closer 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:36.520
 I have accumulated a little light and now I 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.860
 I think it will be visible now will focus 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.530
 mean big little arrow and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.180
 second moment as you see such lights 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:54.320
 yes a little green there on the big 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:59.270
 arrows cant just paint another one 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.470
 cant when this head twist in 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.459
 back side 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.190
 not in the direction of the plant in reverse thread that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.530
 happens that is, it is now pressed 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.760
 nothing 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.750
 should not move that is this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 side we get 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.520
 the clock I hope you can see that on top this one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.090
 spring chko 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:27.459
 during the factory it turns that is in 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.700
 we get this side and back when 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.600
 nothing should happen 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.959
 but here there is worth it so show 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.140
 as 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.370
 time to translate here and opened that is 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.989
 the links should move so here in 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 this position and in this position 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:54.790
 do not want anything to happen but as we 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.230
 See Chinese kosyachok so still want 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.180
 say about these buttons 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.100
 it's fake and the buttons are here 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.330
 completely out of place they are made simply 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:11.250
 for the view but no functional 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.250
 they do not carry the load 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:23.640
 Here such watch their weight is 140 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.640
 gram that is what arguments Tagus links 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.840
 looks good but with steel of course 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.380
 problems to maybe of course got me 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.300
 such a copy is not very good 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.140
 let's say softly maybe you blow better 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.140
 if you will order 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:51.120
