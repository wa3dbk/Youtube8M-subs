00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 during routine patrolling 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.600
 military police officers realized that the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.929
 driver of a vehicle was 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.309
 driving in zigzag and approaching it 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.660
 verified that it was in apparent 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 drunken state 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 the situation, the driver together with the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 with the vehicle was taken to the 16th 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.359
 police subdivision 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.740
 there he could barely stand up and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.740
 he spoke nonsense words 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.899
 the man is out of genius to develop some 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:44.610
 voice and was in one GodÃ³i police to 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:51.469
 table was someone in the family received 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.469
 Very well, a lot of beer will rehearse. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.920
 with one now complicated your 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 responsibility 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.309
 to inspect the vehicle the police 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 found under the hitchhiker's seat several 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 beer cans the police officer who 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.920
 participated in the approach explains how 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 everything happened 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 the staff approached and viewed individual 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 quite drunk 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.659
 then this way of conducting what seems 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.979
 but is taking all the measures 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 able 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.200
 the billings the nature to distrust 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.380
 It will stop and it will rotate for sure. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.090
 because this situation is leaving the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 physical integrity of people 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 pedestrians and other drivers 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 It's a complicated situation so we 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 already the ball to try to avoid that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 the worst happens 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.200
 in the case and came to do the test 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.899
 breathalyzer 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.210
 we are taking steps to 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.579
 do this test leaving soon after 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.350
 if the legislation presumes that you want 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.000
 the officer says relying seeing you 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.950
 noting that one state 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.840
 regardless of the source it will be 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.119
 fined and imprisoned what is surely 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.649
 even if the individual refuses to do so 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.780
 performing the breathalyzer 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.299
 only the police officer viewing the status 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.490
 of the glass studio may be 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.659
 forwarding the necessary case taken 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.659
 appropriate measures
