00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.439
So then, thinking he was safe, the
kid got into an elevator and

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.250
pressed his floor button. He barely
noticed the only other person

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.830
inside with him; a white-haired,
older man. Suddenly though, in

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.310
between two floors, the man reached
over and stopped the elevator.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.250
Ka-CHUNK! The man then stuck his hand
out and grabbed the kid by the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.570
shoulders and whispered “No one
will ever believe you.” He then

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.120
started up the elevator again and
left. And that man was...

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.719
BILL MURRAY!

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.539
Great story, David.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.359
Yeah, real spooky.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.579
Hey, guys?

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.190
Yeah?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.659
Bill Murray isn’t real, right?

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.769
Oh, he’s real.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:44.479
Will!

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.159
He is!

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.269
He’s right. That story happened to
a friend of a friend of mine.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.249
Bullshit!

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.409
Bill Murray’s real alright. I heard
another story.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.870
Tell it!

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.459
Once upon a time, on a night just
like this one, there was a group of

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.469
guys having a bachelor party.
Suddenly, they realized that there

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.979
was one extra person in that group
than there was before. They’d been

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.539
joined by Bill Murray.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.180
Woooooo!

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.469
Stop it!

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.350
He acted like he was just one of
their friends, not famous at all,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.820
and he gave them advice about
marriage. And then he just LEFT!

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.460
No way!

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.090
It’s true. It was on the news.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.259
But this all happened in LA, right?
Bill Murray would never come find

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.679
me where I live, right?

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.600
That’s the thing. Bill Murray can
find you anywhere! If you live near

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.280
a movie set, or where his kids go
to school, or in any town with a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.130
film festival. He’ll find you.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.999
Guys, maybe we should change the
subject.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.640
I saw Bill Murray once.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.560
No! What?! Really?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.539
It’s true. I was in Brooklyn and I
went to this hip bar. I went up to

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.700
get a drink but the bartender
wasn’t the regular bartender...

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.649
It was Bill Murray.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.590
They said he’d been doing it all
night. Just for... fun.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.680
What kind of a celebrity is he?!

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.540
He’s an eccentric celebrity!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.100
But why doesn’t his agent stop
him?!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.270
Bill Murray doesn’t have an agent!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.600
That’s not possible!

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.170
It’s true! The only way to get him
in a movie is to call...

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.660
A voice mail message.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.340
He could make millions off of
Ghostbusters 3 but he refuses to do

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.200
it. He’s a comedian but he prefers
to do dramas. He’s got integrity

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.160
but he did two, count them, TWO
Garfield movies.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.460
Bill Murray is a mystery. He can’t be understood and
he can’t be stopped!

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.560
You’re scaring Rick!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.340
He could show up anywhere at any
time. Even in a random YouTube sketch comedy video.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.400
Ah, you guys are just messing with
me. There’s no way a famous person

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.510
could be that unpredictable and
quirky. I’m going to bed.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.870
You don’t want to sleep out in
these woods.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
You kids should move along. I heard
up in town that there’s a movie

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.610
being shot near here... A Wes
Anderson movie.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.290
Let’s get out of here!

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.500
Nah, that’s impossible.
