00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
versus the samsung galaxy s3 these
phones<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.779> closely<00:00:22.170> matched<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.830> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
phones are very closely matched up in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.679 
phones are very closely matched up in
terms<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> processor<00:00:24.000> speeds<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.539> it's

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
terms of processor speeds but it's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.540 
terms of processor speeds but it's
obvious<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> advantage<00:00:26.340> when

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
obvious to know to as the advantage when

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
obvious to know to as the advantage when
it<00:00:26.580> comes<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.029> screen<00:00:27.300> size<00:00:27.599> all<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.650> I'm

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it comes to screen size all right I'm

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
it comes to screen size all right I'm
gonna<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:28.890> through<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.130> few<00:00:29.340> YouTube<00:00:29.730> videos

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580 
gonna go through a few YouTube videos
for<00:00:30.300> each<00:00:30.359> phone<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.320> loads

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
for each phone and see which one loads

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.420 
for each phone and see which one loads
quicker<00:00:31.890> than<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:33.590> do<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> restart

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
quicker than I'm going to do a restart

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.479 
quicker than I'm going to do a restart
for<00:00:35.640> both<00:00:35.790> phones<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:37.489> reboots

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
for both phones to see which one reboots

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
for both phones to see which one reboots
quicker<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.660> also<00:00:39.809> worth<00:00:40.050> noting<00:00:40.290> i'm

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
going to be connected to the same Wi-Fi

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
going to be connected to the same Wi-Fi
network<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.600> both<00:00:42.840> phones<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.500> let's<00:00:43.800> get

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
network at both phones so let's get

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:59.910 
network at both phones so let's get
right<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.440 

all<00:01:00.920> right<00:01:01.040> looks<00:01:01.190> like<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.340> note2<00:01:01.850> pulled<00:01:02.300> up

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
all right looks like the note2 pulled up

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.110 
all right looks like the note2 pulled up
that<00:01:02.480> video<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.020> little<00:01:03.260> bit<00:01:03.350> quicker<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:10.120> the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
that video a little bit quicker and the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.350 
that video a little bit quicker and the
note<00:01:11.300> want<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.720> again<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.670> note<00:01:13.850> does<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:14.330> a

note want it again the note does have a

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.990 
note want it again the note does have a
slightly<00:01:15.020> faster<00:01:15.380> processor<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:16.280> 1600

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
slightly faster processor it's 1600

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.490 
slightly faster processor it's 1600
megahertz<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.280> galaxy<00:01:19.280> s3<00:01:19.670> s<00:01:19.760> got<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.500> 1500

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
megahertz and the galaxy s3 s got a 1500

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:36.790 
megahertz and the galaxy s3 s got a 1500
megahertz<00:01:21.650> processor<00:01:22.070> on<00:01:22.610> it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.620

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
all right looks like the note pull that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.900 
all right looks like the note pull that
one<00:01:38.780> up<00:01:38.810> quicker<00:01:39.140> as<00:01:39.590> well<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.490> was<00:01:40.640> three

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
one up quicker as well so it was three

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.460 
one up quicker as well so it was three
for<00:01:41.120> three<00:01:42.910> now<00:01:43.910> I'm<00:01:44.030> going<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.210> do<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.470> restart

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
for three now I'm going to do a restart

00:01:45.470 --> 00:02:01.600 
for three now I'm going to do a restart
for<00:01:45.740> both<00:01:45.890> phones

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:26.550 

we'll<00:02:02.210> see<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.750> powers<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.350> quicker

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.870 

all<00:02:27.560> right<00:02:27.770> there<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.370> looks<00:02:28.700> like

all right there you have it looks like

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.930 
all right there you have it looks like
the<00:02:29.090> no<00:02:29.540> 2<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.930> winner<00:02:30.230> again<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.580> no.2<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
the no 2 is the winner again the no.2 is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.350 
the no 2 is the winner again the no.2 is
definitely<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:33.400> lot<00:02:34.400> nicer<00:02:34.670> guy<00:02:34.940> uses<00:02:35.330> a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
definitely a lot nicer guy uses a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.480 
definitely a lot nicer guy uses a
browser<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:36.020> well<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.620> mean<00:02:36.980> mainly<00:02:37.130> because
