00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
control the exposure and frankly I knew

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
control the exposure and frankly I knew

was<00:02:27.960> not<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.410> concerned<00:02:28.650> about<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.070> wanted<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
was not so concerned about I wanted to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.340 
was not so concerned about I wanted to
stop<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.000> action<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.570> five<00:02:30.750> hundredths<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
stop the action but five hundredths of a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.080 
stop the action but five hundredths of a
second<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:31.980> environment<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.700> plenty

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
second in this environment was plenty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.000 
second in this environment was plenty
but<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.750> wanted<00:02:34.080> enough<00:02:34.380> depth<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.800> field

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
but I also wanted enough depth the field

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
but I also wanted enough depth the field
that<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:35.520> captured<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.570> beauty<00:02:36.990> of

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that it really captured the beauty of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440 
that it really captured the beauty of
this<00:02:37.320> landscape<00:02:37.740> what<00:02:38.640> Tommy<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.060> actually

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
this landscape what Tommy is actually

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
this landscape what Tommy is actually
doing<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.260> interest<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:41.070> this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
doing is not that interest and had this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.170 
doing is not that interest and had this
been<00:02:41.610> blue<00:02:42.480> sky<00:02:42.930> normal<00:02:43.860> sunset<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> don't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
been blue sky normal sunset I don't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.610 
been blue sky normal sunset I don't
think<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.900> compelling<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
think this would be as compelling a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
think this would be as compelling a
photograph<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:47.580> add<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.540> action

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
with this setting with this light that's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620 
with this setting with this light that's
the<00:02:53.040> final<00:02:53.460> ingredient<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.270> makes<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the final ingredient that makes this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.900 
the final ingredient that makes this
photo<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.470> good<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:56.100> hopefully<00:02:56.610> great
