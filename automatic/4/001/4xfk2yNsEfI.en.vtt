00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.070 
something got a cs3 level flip case the
Wallis<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.730> special<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:27.539> that's

Wallis the what it is special and that's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.269 
Wallis the what it is special and that's
what<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> looks<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> I'll<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.920> sure

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
what it looks like and I'll just be sure

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.119 
what it looks like and I'll just be sure
you<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.640> site<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.620> comparison<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> two<00:00:37.129> so

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you a site is comparison of the two so

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.850 
you a site is comparison of the two so
as<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.610> tell<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.200> new<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
as you can tell this one the new case is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.569 
as you can tell this one the new case is
slightly<00:00:41.129> bigger<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> lot

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
slightly bigger but it would be a lot

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
slightly bigger but it would be a lot
more<00:00:44.610> protective<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.809> average<00:00:46.289> case

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
more protective than the average case

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040 
more protective than the average case
which<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.309> got<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.690> covers<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
which I have got which just covers the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.439 
which I have got which just covers the
back<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> quite<00:00:52.410> quickly<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.180 

so<00:00:57.449> obviously<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.090> normal<00:01:00.890> which<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so obviously this is the normal which I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.039 
so obviously this is the normal which I
picked<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.910> ten<00:01:03.300> pounds<00:01:05.450> it's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
picked up for ten pounds it's a bit of a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.539 
picked up for ten pounds it's a bit of a
rip-off<00:01:07.439> considering<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> 4/5<00:01:10.549> from

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
rip-off considering I got this 4/5 from

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
rip-off considering I got this 4/5 from

really<00:03:35.820> thick<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.330> bulky<00:03:36.540> because<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.470> can't

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
really thick and bulky because you can't

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.380 
really thick and bulky because you can't
really<00:03:37.890> tell<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.370> videos<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.090> will

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
buying one as this song was I think it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.100 
buying one as this song was I think it
was<00:03:47.220> surround<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.910> 5<00:03:48.270> pound<00:03:48.600> mark<00:03:48.840> from

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
was surround the 5 pound mark from

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.070 
was surround the 5 pound mark from
Amazon<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.090> would<00:03:51.090> definitely<00:03:51.720> write<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
Amazon I would definitely write it

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.070 
Amazon I would definitely write it
because<00:03:52.860> it's<00:03:53.100> cheap<00:03:53.489> it's<00:03:53.910> really<00:03:54.630> not<00:03:54.870> very

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
because it's cheap it's really not very

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.130 
because it's cheap it's really not very
thick<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:56.310> I'll<00:03:56.760> show<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.060> that's<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.930> my

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
thick like I'll show you that's with my

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.280 
thick like I'll show you that's with my
thumb<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.060> literally<00:04:00.510> no<00:04:00.810> thicker<00:04:01.110> than

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
thumb so it's literally no thicker than

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.110 
thumb so it's literally no thicker than
a<00:04:01.739> fan<00:04:02.160> sideways<00:04:02.640> really<00:04:03.290> then<00:04:04.290> that's<00:04:05.120> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
a fan sideways really then that's it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.010 
a fan sideways really then that's it
compared<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.799> other<00:04:08.040> case

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
compared to the other case

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.390 
compared to the other case
you<00:04:10.020> can<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.860> not<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> much

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you can see it's not really that much

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.260 
you can see it's not really that much
bigger<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.590> put<00:04:14.010> on<00:04:14.280> top<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.060> can

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
tell it slightly is bigger because it's

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.400 
tell it slightly is bigger because it's
