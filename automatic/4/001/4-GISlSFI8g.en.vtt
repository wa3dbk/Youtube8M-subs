00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
our supply pressure this would be for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.180 
our supply pressure this would be for
boost<00:02:10.570> pressure<00:02:10.810> because<00:02:11.320> we<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.680> use

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
boost pressure because we actually use

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.940 
boost pressure because we actually use
compressed<00:02:12.610> air<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.390> test<00:02:14.350> bench<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
compressed air on the test bench to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
compressed air on the test bench to
simulate<00:02:15.930> turbo<00:02:16.930> charger<00:02:17.620> boost

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.420 

I<00:02:24.500> mean<00:02:25.500> there's<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.770> many<00:02:25.890> different<00:02:26.280> types

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I mean there's so many different types

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.530 
I mean there's so many different types
of<00:02:26.580> things<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.819> you're<00:02:27.000> looking<00:02:27.239> at<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
of things that you're looking at and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.809 
of things that you're looking at and
some<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> times<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:28.950> quite<00:02:29.340> get

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
some of the times you don't quite get

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.640 
some of the times you don't quite get
what<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:30.239> looking<00:02:30.480> at<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.260> really<00:02:31.500> do

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
what you're looking at and you really do

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
what you're looking at and you really do
have<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.860> think<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.489> your<00:02:32.580> head<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.780> work

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
have to think in your head to to work

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.600 
have to think in your head to to work
out<00:02:34.140> what's<00:02:34.319> going<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.709> especially<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
out what's going on especially in the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.770 
out what's going on especially in the
government<00:02:36.030> side<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.300> things

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
government side of things

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.370 
government side of things
but<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> challenge<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.400> makes<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
but it's the challenge that makes you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500 
but it's the challenge that makes you
want<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.560> overcome<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:42.000> challenge<00:02:42.060> whether

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
want to overcome that challenge whether

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.530 
want to overcome that challenge whether
you<00:02:42.600> want<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> beat<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:46.830> taking<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you want to beat it I'm taking the the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
you want to beat it I'm taking the the
governor<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.620> governor<00:02:49.920> housing<00:02:50.310> up

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
governor of the governor housing up

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
governor of the governor housing up
inside<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.170> governor

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
inside here you can see the governor

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.880 
inside here you can see the governor
weights<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.660> levers<00:02:55.019> which<00:02:55.230> operates<00:02:55.739> on

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
weights and the levers which operates on

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.150 
weights and the levers which operates on
and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:57.480> need<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.930> take<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.799> Start

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and I just need to take this Start

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340 
and I just need to take this Start
screen<00:02:59.340> off<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.810> you'll<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.840> able<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
screen off and you'll be able to get it

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.199 
screen off and you'll be able to get it
off<00:03:01.470> these<00:03:02.160> are<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.400> governor<00:03:02.760> weights<00:03:02.940> which

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
off these are the governor weights which

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.009 
off these are the governor weights which
is<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.569> controls<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:05.420> engine<00:03:06.420> speed<00:03:06.810> from

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
is what controls the engine speed from

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.130 
is what controls the engine speed from
running<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.370> shaft<00:03:08.819> spins<00:03:09.180> faster<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
running out as the shaft spins faster it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.600 
running out as the shaft spins faster it
causes<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> governor<00:03:10.950> weights<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.280> come<00:03:11.430> out

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
causes the governor weights to come out

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.600 
causes the governor weights to come out
from<00:03:11.880> centrifugal<00:03:12.299> force<00:03:12.690> which<00:03:13.560> tries<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
from centrifugal force which tries to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.460 
from centrifugal force which tries to
pull<00:03:14.790> back<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.299> rack<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.510> stop<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.350> from

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
pull back on the rack and stop it from

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.750 
pull back on the rack and stop it from
giving<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.920> much<00:03:17.069> fuel<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.519> doesn't

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
giving as much fuel so that doesn't

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.229 
giving as much fuel so that doesn't
over-rev<00:03:18.180> it's<00:03:18.330> not<00:03:19.069> you're<00:03:20.180> responsible<00:03:21.180> for

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
over-rev it's not you're responsible for

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.090 
over-rev it's not you're responsible for
buying<00:03:21.630> an<00:03:21.810> apprentice<00:03:22.470> kit<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.799> start<00:03:22.980> off

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
buying an apprentice kit to start off

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.330 
buying an apprentice kit to start off
here<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.590> as<00:03:25.769> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
here and then as you go you just as you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.130 
here and then as you go you just as you
need<00:03:26.489> tools<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.970> buy<00:03:27.120> them<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.989> can

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
need tools you buy them and so you can

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
you're going to be more valuable and be
