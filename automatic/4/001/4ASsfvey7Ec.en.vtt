on behalf of expert village I'm Terry

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.350 
on behalf of expert village I'm Terry
and<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.790> tell<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.210> about

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
and I'm here to tell you today about

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.470 
and I'm here to tell you today about
building<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:04.200> wrought<00:00:04.350> iron<00:00:04.410> fence<00:00:05.390> here<00:00:06.390> I'm

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
building a wrought iron fence here I'm

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.670 
building a wrought iron fence here I'm
going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> show<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.839> two<00:00:07.080> types<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.529> welding

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
going to show you two types of welding

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.060 
going to show you two types of welding
downhill<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.790> uphill<00:00:09.469> uphill<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.650> usually

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
downhill and uphill uphill is usually

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.339 
downhill and uphill uphill is usually
done<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.880> strength<00:00:12.240> downhill<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.200> as

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
done for strength downhill is not as

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
done for strength downhill is not as
strong<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.610> faster<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:15.780> you're

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
strong but it's faster and if you're

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
strong but it's faster and if you're
working<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.320> thinner<00:00:16.590> material<00:00:17.300> then<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
working on thinner material then you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.840 
working on thinner material then you
don't<00:00:18.690> burn<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.109> quite<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.590> long<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.730> can

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
don't burn in quite as long and you can

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.750 
don't burn in quite as long and you can
let<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.060> beat<00:00:21.300> much<00:00:21.539> quicker<00:00:22.460> going<00:00:23.460> uphill

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
let it beat much quicker going uphill

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.170 
let it beat much quicker going uphill
you<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> move<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.439> faster<00:00:26.029> right<00:00:27.029> now

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you have to move a lot faster right now

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:38.960 
you have to move a lot faster right now
I'm<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> show<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.660> down

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.150 

okay<00:00:39.970> I<00:00:40.270> kept<00:00:40.840> my<00:00:40.960> nozzle<00:00:41.200> pointed<00:00:41.710> up<00:00:41.860> because

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
okay I kept my nozzle pointed up because

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.860 
okay I kept my nozzle pointed up because
I'm<00:00:42.280> trying<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> push<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:43.180> up<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:43.600> keep<00:00:43.750> it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
I'm trying to push that up to keep it

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.600 
I'm trying to push that up to keep it
from<00:00:43.990> going<00:00:44.200> down<00:00:44.530> it<00:00:44.770> if<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.160> was<00:00:45.310> to<00:00:45.460> go<00:00:45.580> down

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
from going down it if I was to go down

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.630 
from going down it if I was to go down
it<00:00:46.540> would<00:00:46.690> obviously<00:00:46.810> lay<00:00:47.320> in<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.830> lot<00:00:48.400> less

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
it would obviously lay in a lot less

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.460 
it would obviously lay in a lot less
material<00:00:49.270> you<00:00:49.540> wouldn't<00:00:49.780> have<00:00:49.870> near<00:00:50.200> as<00:00:50.230> much

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
material you wouldn't have near as much

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.890 
material you wouldn't have near as much
material<00:00:51.070> laying<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:51.910> there<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.270> your<00:00:52.540> nozzle

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
material laying in there so your nozzle

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.890 
material laying in there so your nozzle
wants<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:53.170> go<00:00:53.290> up<00:00:53.440> at<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.650> 45<00:00:54.160> degree<00:00:54.900> I'm

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
wants to go up at a 45 degree I'm

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.810 
wants to go up at a 45 degree I'm
ambidextrous<00:00:56.770> so<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.040> can<00:00:57.340> well<00:00:57.489> with<00:00:57.700> either

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
ambidextrous so I can well with either

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.299 
ambidextrous so I can well with either
hand<00:00:58.170> upside<00:00:59.170> down<00:00:59.380> some<00:00:59.620> people<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.040> just

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
hand upside down some people this just

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.650 
hand upside down some people this just
feels<00:01:00.550> really<00:01:00.790> weird<00:01:01.030> they<00:01:01.270> think<00:01:01.510> they<00:01:01.630> have

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
feels really weird they think they have

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.560 
feels really weird they think they have
to<00:01:02.020> get<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.040> here<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.580> go<00:01:03.910> like<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.360> well

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to get in here and go like this well

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.840 
to get in here and go like this well
obviously<00:01:04.690> things<00:01:05.229> are<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.470> my<00:01:05.590> way<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
obviously things are in my way so you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.910 
obviously things are in my way so you
have<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.120> be<00:01:07.240> adaptable<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.140> where<00:01:08.620> you<00:01:08.770> can

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
have to be adaptable to where you can

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:19.859 
have to be adaptable to where you can
well<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.250> any<00:01:09.369> position<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.390> that's<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.720> down

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
well in any position and that's it down

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.050 
well in any position and that's it down
here<00:01:20.080> with<00:01:20.290> now<00:01:21.280> I'm<00:01:21.430> going<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.729> up<00:01:22.030> here

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
here with now I'm going to go up here

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.719 
here with now I'm going to go up here
weld<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:23.229> an<00:01:23.410> uphill<00:01:23.619> well<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.520> also

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
weld on it on an uphill well you also

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.810 
weld on it on an uphill well you also
want<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.030> do<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.270> horseshoe<00:01:25.630> effect<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.790> you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
want to do the horseshoe effect or you

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.660 
want to do the horseshoe effect or you
can<00:01:28.119> do<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.960> zero<00:01:29.350> effect<00:01:29.740> now<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.130> Wells<00:01:30.430> not

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
can do the zero effect now the Wells not

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.980 
can do the zero effect now the Wells not
going<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.910> look<00:01:31.030> like<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.450> it's<00:01:31.690> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> be

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
going to look like this it's going to be

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.930 
going to look like this it's going to be
high<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.380> center<00:01:32.680> because<00:01:32.860> you're<00:01:33.820> going

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
high in the center because you're going

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.580 
high in the center because you're going
to<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.090> passing<00:01:34.330> over<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.750> same<00:01:34.960> clip<00:01:35.170> over

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
to be passing over the same clip over

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.190 
to be passing over the same clip over
the<00:01:35.680> same<00:01:35.890> place<00:01:36.160> twice<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.149> if<00:01:37.660> it

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
the same place twice and it just if it

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.620 
the same place twice and it just if it
lays<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.680> your<00:01:38.710> material<00:01:39.369> if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.300> have<00:01:40.509> to

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
lays in your material if you have to

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.270 
lays in your material if you have to
move<00:01:40.780> fast<00:01:41.110> with<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.470> point<00:01:41.710> your<00:01:41.920> novel

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
move fast with the point your novel

00:01:42.280 --> 00:02:01.389 
move fast with the point your novel
upward<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.729> did<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.119> first<00:01:46.300> time

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.260 

it's<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.579> too<00:02:02.789> bad<00:02:02.969> well<00:02:04.759> let<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:05.880> touch<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.930 
much better looking well now what would
happen<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.770> was<00:02:40.920> pointing<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.760> trying

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
happen if I was pointing down and trying

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:55.040 
happen if I was pointing down and trying
to<00:02:42.030> follow<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.450> up<00:02:53.150> see<00:02:54.150> I've<00:02:54.300> mounted<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.900> in

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
to follow it up see I've mounted up in

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.210 
to follow it up see I've mounted up in
the<00:02:55.110> middle<00:02:56.060> it's<00:02:57.060> virtually<00:02:57.450> flat<00:02:58.220> that's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the middle it's virtually flat that's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160 
the middle it's virtually flat that's
what<00:02:59.460> they<00:02:59.580> make<00:02:59.760> well<00:02:59.940> with<00:03:00.150> stick<00:03:00.810> welding

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
what they make well with stick welding

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
what they make well with stick welding
is<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.650> little<00:03:02.040> more<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.550> little<00:03:03.090> more

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
is a little more a little more

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.510 
is a little more a little more
complicated<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.650> course<00:03:04.710> but<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
complicated of course but you have to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.070 
complicated of course but you have to
work<00:03:05.670> your<00:03:05.820> rod<00:03:06.000> back

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
work your rod back

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.470 
work your rod back
with<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> MIG<00:03:07.950> welder<00:03:08.000> that's<00:03:09.000> all<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.330> need

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
with a MIG welder that's all you need

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.000 
with a MIG welder that's all you need
for<00:03:09.660> building<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.790> basic<00:03:11.790> project
