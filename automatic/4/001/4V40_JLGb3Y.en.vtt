presenting fluoride pop-ups in front of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.130 
presenting fluoride pop-ups in front of
them<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.939> where<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> fish<00:00:24.689> had<00:00:24.810> been<00:00:24.960> caught

so<00:00:25.439> many<00:00:25.590> times<00:00:25.949> during<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> spring<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.880> these

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so many times during the spring on these

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
so many times during the spring on these
bright<00:00:27.480> bates<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.019> fish<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.349> spooking<00:00:28.859> off

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
bright bates the fish was spooking off

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
bright bates the fish was spooking off
the<00:00:29.130> spot<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.550> even<00:00:29.730> attempting<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> eat<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the spot not even attempting to eat and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.970 
the spot not even attempting to eat and
they're<00:00:30.720> actually<00:00:30.840> avoiding<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> area

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
they're actually avoiding the area

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
they're actually avoiding the area
because<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> bright<00:00:33.270> hookbait

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because there was a bright hookbait

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
because there was a bright hookbait
there<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.290> made<00:00:34.620> me<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:34.920> back<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
there so that made me go back to the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.799 
there so that made me go back to the
drawing<00:00:35.640> board<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
drawing board and think about what I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
drawing board and think about what I
could<00:00:36.870> develop<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.770> using<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> cell<00:00:38.399> these

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
could develop I was using the cell these

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
could develop I was using the cell these
wonderful<00:00:39.420> bates<00:00:39.629> everyone<00:00:40.050> knows<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.350> much

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
wonderful bates everyone knows how much

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
wonderful bates everyone knows how much
I<00:00:40.649> love<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> wanted<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.059> something

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I love them so I wanted to do something

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
I love them so I wanted to do something
that<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:43.110> match<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> boy<00:00:44.370> Lee

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that would match this with this boy Lee

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.569 
that would match this with this boy Lee
but<00:00:45.180> ultimately<00:00:45.960> still<00:00:46.320> stand<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
but ultimately still stand out so I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this tub as you can see our cell Hut

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
this tub as you can see our cell Hut
bait<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> slightly<00:00:55.920> different<00:00:56.190> tinta

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
bait with a slightly different tinta

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
bait with a slightly different tinta
that's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> normal<00:00:57.030> cell<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that's a normal cell and then the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
that's a normal cell and then the
hookbait<00:00:59.239> slightly<00:01:00.239> different<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.629> color<00:01:00.840> but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hookbait slightly different in color but

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.439 
hookbait slightly different in color but
still<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.039> blatant<00:01:02.520> they're<00:01:02.969> very<00:01:03.210> easy

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
still not that blatant they're very easy

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
still not that blatant they're very easy
to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.260> slightly<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.949> balanced

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to do there's slightly more balanced

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.700 
to do there's slightly more balanced
than<00:01:05.549> normal<00:01:06.210> sort<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> court<00:01:06.720> ball<00:01:06.930> bait<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
than normal sort of court ball bait so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
than normal sort of court ball bait so
let's<00:01:08.010> run<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> how<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> through<00:01:08.850> exactly<00:01:09.210> how

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
let's run you how to through exactly how

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.679 
let's run you how to through exactly how
you<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> firstly<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.010> put<00:01:11.280> half<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.450> tub<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you do it firstly you put half a tub of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
you do it firstly you put half a tub of
Polaris<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> bag<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> tub

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
Polaris into a bag so take that tub

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.060 
Polaris into a bag so take that tub
halfway<00:01:15.060> there<00:01:15.540> straight<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.590> clear<00:01:16.799> bag

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
halfway there straight into a clear bag

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.969 
halfway there straight into a clear bag
then<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> cell<00:01:18.450> bass<00:01:18.659> mix<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
then you get the cell bass mix with that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.679 
then you get the cell bass mix with that
I<00:01:20.159> fill<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> Polaris<00:01:21.060> tub<00:01:21.240> again<00:01:21.360> about

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
I fill out the Polaris tub again about

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
I fill out the Polaris tub again about
quarter<00:01:22.080> full<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> bass<00:01:23.220> mix<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
quarter full with the bass mix from the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.570 
quarter full with the bass mix from the
cell<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.840> both<00:01:25.110> goes<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> clear<00:01:26.070> bag<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
cell that both goes into the clear bag I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
cell that both goes into the clear bag I
blow<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> bag<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> whole<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
blow that bag up give the whole lot of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
blow that bag up give the whole lot of
shape<00:01:28.829> make<00:01:29.220> sure<00:01:29.250> everything's<00:01:29.850> mixed<00:01:30.060> into

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
shape make sure everything's mixed into

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.330 
shape make sure everything's mixed into
now<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.930> Polaris<00:01:31.500> which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> floating

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
now you got Polaris which is a floating

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
now you got Polaris which is a floating
bass<00:01:32.520> mix<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> cell<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> sinking

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
bass mix and the cell which is a sinking

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
up with one big hard bit of pace I've

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.560 
up with one big hard bit of pace I've
got<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.770> pace<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.670> I've<00:02:47.970> been<00:02:48.120> rolling

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
got a bit of pace that I've been rolling

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.810 
got a bit of pace that I've been rolling
the<00:02:48.600> baits<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.640> now

the baits with which is just right now

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.220 
the baits with which is just right now
look<00:02:51.150> actually<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.600> probably<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.050> bit

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
look actually it's probably going a bit

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.920 
look actually it's probably going a bit
dry<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.130> heat<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> add<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.330> pace<00:02:54.540> bit

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
dry in the heat but I add the pace bit

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.290 
dry in the heat but I add the pace bit
by<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> bit<00:02:55.410> nice<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.070> slowly<00:02:56.280> keep<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.880> working

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
by a bit nice and slowly keep it working

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.210 
by a bit nice and slowly keep it working
in<00:02:57.420> there<00:02:57.630> until<00:02:57.870> I've<00:02:58.290> got<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.500> pace<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.830> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
in there until I've got a pace that is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.400 
in there until I've got a pace that is
slightly<00:03:00.090> sticky<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.870> touch<00:03:00.960> because

slightly sticky to the touch because

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.930
