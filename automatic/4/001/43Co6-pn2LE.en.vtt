there<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.410> small<00:00:17.220> chance<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.119> will

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
there is a small chance that this will

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.410 
there is a small chance that this will
actually<00:00:18.539> not<00:00:18.990> even<00:00:19.020> exist<00:00:19.880> with<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> rumored

is going to be costing only two hundred
dollars<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.539> considering<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.230> we

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
dollars that in considering that we

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
dollars that in considering that we
haven't<00:00:31.769> had<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.369> update<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> ipod<00:00:33.480> touch

haven't had an update to the ipod touch
in<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> year<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.430> been<00:00:35.579> quite<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> bit

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
in over a year now it's been quite a bit

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
in over a year now it's been quite a bit
over<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> year<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.020> maybe<00:00:37.200> near<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> 4th

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
over a year now so maybe near the 4th

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
over a year now so maybe near the 4th
generation<00:00:38.790> ipod<00:00:39.390> touch<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.930> apples<00:00:40.530> last

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
generation ipod touch was apples last

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
generation ipod touch was apples last
ipod<00:00:41.489> touch<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.260> there<00:00:43.500> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
ipod touch but i do think that there is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
ipod touch but i do think that there is
a<00:00:43.680> larger<00:00:44.280> chance<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.760> apple<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.570> ahead

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a larger chance that apple will go ahead

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.369 
a larger chance that apple will go ahead
and<00:00:46.110> still<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.430> ipod<00:00:47.850> touch<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:48.989> as

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and still make an ipod touch as well as

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
and still make an ipod touch as well as
an<00:00:49.469> ipad<00:00:49.800> mini<00:00:50.039> alright<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.700> first

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
an ipad mini alright so my first

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150

with a September 21st release date now
personally<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.570> apple<00:01:10.049> will

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
personally I don't think that apple will

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.160 
personally I don't think that apple will
want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> share<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> spotlight<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.170> other

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
want to share the spotlight with other

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
want to share the spotlight with other
products<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.950> think<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.640> during<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.030> event

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
products I think that during this event

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.170 
products I think that during this event
they'll<00:01:15.540> talk<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.750> iOS<00:01:16.259> 6<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.700> iphone<00:01:18.000> 5

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
they'll talk about iOS 6 in the iphone 5

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
they'll talk about iOS 6 in the iphone 5
I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.640> uh

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I think that's just about it really uh

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
I think that's just about it really uh
well<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.689> might<00:01:21.810> talk<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.229> some<00:01:22.439> numbers

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
well they might talk about some numbers

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
well they might talk about some numbers
but<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.549> always<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.780> think

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
but they always do that I don't think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
but they always do that I don't think
that<00:01:25.259> Apple<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:25.950> wants<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> add<00:01:26.460> things

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that Apple really wants to add things

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.929 
that Apple really wants to add things
like<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> ipod<00:01:27.540> touch<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.979> ipad<00:01:29.340> mini<00:01:29.369> or

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
like the ipod touch or the ipad mini or

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.170 
like the ipod touch or the ipad mini or
other<00:01:30.299> ipods<00:01:30.810> into<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> event<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.400> could

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
other ipods into this event this could

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.340 
other ipods into this event this could
be<00:01:33.210> apple's<00:01:33.810> largest<00:01:34.439> product<00:01:35.250> release

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
be apple's largest product release

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.109 
be apple's largest product release
period<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> uh<00:01:37.700> probably<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
period and uh probably one of the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
period and uh probably one of the
biggest<00:01:39.360> product<00:01:39.689> releases<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> long<00:01:40.829> time

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
biggest product releases in a long time

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.569 
biggest product releases in a long time
so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.799> important<00:01:44.340> event

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so this is a very very important event

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
so this is a very very important event
for<00:01:44.610> apple<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.869> they

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
for apple and i don't think that they

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749 
for apple and i don't think that they
want<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> iphone<00:01:46.470> 5<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> share<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
want the iphone 5 to have to share the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
want the iphone 5 to have to share the
spotlight<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.869> far<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.290> design<00:01:49.680> i

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
spotlight so as far as the design i

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
spotlight so as far as the design i
think<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.880> keep<00:01:51.570> something<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
think that they will keep something that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
think that they will keep something that
is<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.509> similar<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.840> we've

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
is going to be similar to what we've

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
is going to be similar to what we've
been<00:01:55.110> seeing<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> ipod<00:01:55.860> touches<00:01:56.280> i<00:01:56.430> think

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
been seeing in the ipod touches i think

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
been seeing in the ipod touches i think
that<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> keep<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.350> look

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that they want to keep kind of this look

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
that they want to keep kind of this look
to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> ipod<00:01:59.399> touch<00:01:59.460> line<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.420> never<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to the ipod touch line that never you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.240 
to the ipod touch line that never you
see<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.200> oh<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.680> ipod<00:02:02.009> touch

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
see you go oh that's an ipod touch

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
see you go oh that's an ipod touch
instead<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> saying<00:02:02.939> wait<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.659> iphone

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
instead of saying wait is that an iphone

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.969 
instead of saying wait is that an iphone
or<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.729> ipod<00:02:06.149> touch<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
or an ipod touch or what is that so I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350 
or an ipod touch or what is that so I
definitely<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.149> see

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
definitely think that we will see

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.119 
definitely think that we will see
something<00:02:09.690> similar<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.649> 4th<00:02:10.860> generation

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
something similar to the 4th generation

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.670 
something similar to the 4th generation
we<00:02:11.520> might<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.879> something<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.450> bit

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
we might see something a little bit

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.440 
we might see something a little bit
thinner<00:02:12.920> which<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.670> know<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.239> fourth

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
thinner which I know the fourth

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.440 
thinner which I know the fourth
generation<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.290> pretty<00:02:15.920> darn<00:02:16.129> thin<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.609> also

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
generation was pretty darn thin and also

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.420 
generation was pretty darn thin and also
I<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.689> think<00:02:18.079> that<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.709> iphone<00:02:18.829> 5<00:02:19.219> gets

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
I do think that if the iphone 5 gets

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.699 
I do think that if the iphone 5 gets
larger<00:02:19.760> screen<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.689> ipod<00:02:21.109> touch<00:02:21.140> 5th

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
larger screen that the ipod touch 5th

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.619 
larger screen that the ipod touch 5th
generation<00:02:21.950> will<00:02:22.370> definitely<00:02:22.969> get<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.239> larger

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
generation will definitely get a larger

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.929 
generation will definitely get a larger
screen<00:02:23.870> personally<00:02:24.859> i<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.579> ipod

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
screen personally i think that the ipod

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.970 
screen personally i think that the ipod
touch<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.019> be<00:02:27.140> borrowing<00:02:27.439> a<00:02:27.650> lot<00:02:27.859> of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
touch is going to be borrowing a lot of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.369 
touch is going to be borrowing a lot of
features<00:02:28.340> from<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.120> iphone<00:02:29.480> 5<00:02:29.719> now<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.319> of

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
features from the iphone 5 now one of

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.259 
features from the iphone 5 now one of
the<00:02:30.500> features<00:02:31.129> i<00:02:31.280> don't<00:02:31.609> think<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.879> ipod

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
the features i don't think the ipod

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.809 
the features i don't think the ipod
touch<00:02:32.299> will<00:02:32.989> share<00:02:33.349> with<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.129> iphone<00:02:34.400> 5<00:02:34.579> is

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
touch will share with the iphone 5 is

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.910 
touch will share with the iphone 5 is
the<00:02:35.000> camera<00:02:35.389> I<00:02:35.569> don't<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.319> it's<00:02:36.680> going<00:02:36.829> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the camera I don't think it's going to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.569 
the camera I don't think it's going to
have<00:02:37.069> in<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.700> good<00:02:38.359> camera<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.920> iphone<00:02:40.250> 5<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
have in as good camera as the iphone 5 I

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.399 
have in as good camera as the iphone 5 I
think<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.879> we<00:02:41.000> might<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.450> 1080p<00:02:42.079> video

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
think that we might see 1080p video

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.619 
think that we might see 1080p video
however<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.280> think<00:02:43.430> we'll<00:02:43.790> see<00:02:44.000> something<00:02:44.329> more

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
however I think we'll see something more

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.960 
however I think we'll see something more
similar<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.230> get<00:02:45.349> iphone<00:02:45.620> 4<00:02:45.859> s's<00:02:46.069> camera<00:02:46.790> in

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
similar to get iphone 4 s's camera in

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.449 
similar to get iphone 4 s's camera in
optics<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:48.230> new<00:02:48.379> ipod<00:02:48.799> touch<00:02:49.040> i<00:02:49.280> think

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
optics in the new ipod touch i think

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.970 
optics in the new ipod touch i think
this<00:02:49.549> is<00:02:49.609> just<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:50.030> way<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.450> apple<00:02:51.319> making<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
this is just a way of apple making the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.429 
this is just a way of apple making the
iphone<00:02:52.280> 5<00:02:52.459> i<00:02:52.849> have<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.450> little<00:02:53.780> bit<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.079> larger

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
iphone 5 i have a little bit of a larger

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.020 
iphone 5 i have a little bit of a larger
incentive<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.159> i<00:02:55.220> think<00:02:55.459> we'll<00:02:55.700> see<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.000> a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
incentive and i think we'll see that a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.849 
incentive and i think we'll see that a
lot<00:02:56.120> throughout<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.169> features<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
lot throughout the features of the

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.520 
lot throughout the features of the
iPhone<00:02:58.099> 5<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.269> ipod<00:02:59.540> touch<00:02:59.810> I've<00:03:00.139> used<00:03:00.379> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
iPhone 5 in the ipod touch I've used a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.379 
iPhone 5 in the ipod touch I've used a
few<00:03:00.709> ipod<00:03:01.099> touch<00:03:01.280> 4th<00:03:01.549> durations<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.209> they

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
few ipod touch 4th durations and they

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.970 
few ipod touch 4th durations and they
are<00:03:02.540> slow<00:03:02.989> at<00:03:03.139> this<00:03:03.290> point<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.709> it's<00:03:03.799> the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
are slow at this point and it's the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.849 
are slow at this point and it's the
newest<00:03:04.340> thing<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.639> apple<00:03:05.349> offers<00:03:06.349> as<00:03:06.560> far<00:03:06.739> as

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
newest thing that apple offers as far as

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.349 
newest thing that apple offers as far as
my<00:03:07.010> ipod<00:03:07.219> touch<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.549> i<00:03:07.609> definitely<00:03:07.939> think<00:03:08.269> that

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
my ipod touch so i definitely think that

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.199 
my ipod touch so i definitely think that
the<00:03:08.540> ipod<00:03:08.930> touch<00:03:08.959> 5th<00:03:09.829> generation<00:03:10.129> is<00:03:10.549> going

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
the ipod touch 5th generation is going

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.860 
the ipod touch 5th generation is going
to<00:03:11.359> get<00:03:11.480> much<00:03:11.750> faster<00:03:12.349> processing<00:03:13.250> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
to get much faster processing and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.539 
to get much faster processing and
graphics<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.139> think<00:03:15.409> that<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.829> will<00:03:16.129> come<00:03:16.370> in

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
graphics I think that this will come in

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.170 
graphics I think that this will come in
the<00:03:16.579> form<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.239> a5x<00:03:18.019> chip<00:03:18.229> and<00:03:18.729> some<00:03:19.729> extra

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
the form of the a5x chip and some extra

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.030 
the form of the a5x chip and some extra
ram<00:03:20.419> also<00:03:21.169> some<00:03:21.319> of<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.440> new<00:03:21.590> things<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.949> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
ram also some of the new things in the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.879 
ram also some of the new things in the
iphone<00:03:22.370> 5<00:03:22.549> such<00:03:22.790> as<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> new<00:03:23.180> dock<00:03:23.419> connector

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
iphone 5 such as the new dock connector

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.589 
iphone 5 such as the new dock connector
should<00:03:24.889> show<00:03:25.129> up<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.519> new<00:03:25.639> ipod<00:03:26.060> touch<00:03:26.269> 5th

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
should show up in the new ipod touch 5th

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.259 
should show up in the new ipod touch 5th
generation<00:03:26.930> i<00:03:27.319> mean<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.979> makes<00:03:28.189> sense<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.729> i

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
generation i mean it makes sense and i

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.179 
generation i mean it makes sense and i
think<00:03:29.479> that<00:03:29.659> is<00:03:29.810> why<00:03:30.019> they<00:03:30.409> are<00:03:30.439> also<00:03:30.739> going<00:03:31.129> to

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
think that is why they are also going to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
will be announced with the iphone 5

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.250 
will be announced with the iphone 5
instead<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:37.970> ipod<00:03:38.299> touch<00:03:38.329> happening<00:03:39.079> and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
instead of the ipod touch happening and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.159 
instead of the ipod touch happening and
then<00:03:39.439> oh<00:03:39.680> well<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.090> iphone<00:03:41.359> 5<00:03:41.540> also<00:03:41.840> has<00:03:41.989> these

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
then oh well the iphone 5 also has these

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.839 
then oh well the iphone 5 also has these
features<00:03:42.560> from<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> ipod<00:03:43.069> touch<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.639> I

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
features from the ipod touch so I

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.999 
features from the ipod touch so I
definitely<00:03:44.509> think<00:03:44.689> this<00:03:44.900> makes<00:03:45.319> sense<00:03:45.560> as<00:03:45.739> far

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.009 
definitely think this makes sense as far

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.189 
definitely think this makes sense as far
as<00:03:46.129> timing<00:03:46.459> with<00:03:46.939> all<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.299> events<00:03:47.720> alright
