00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.290
 make your own barbs because you do not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.930
 I know if it will happen to you but to me 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 they lose me every moment then I go 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.010
 to teach how to make barbs with things that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 let's have at home for example the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.279
 typical cards that we already use it or 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.930
 any other plastic that you have 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 today we are going to learn how to manufacture 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.540
 your own barbs so you do not have 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 to touch with fingers stay and let's 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.790
 learn it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.960
 [Music] 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.960
 [Applause] 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.850
 to make our own leaks 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.980
 we will need scissors one 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.339
 bowling a pencil or something that will help us 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.199
 mark on the plastic the shape of the barb 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.359
 some of these advertising cards 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.159
 gas station points cards 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.799
 credit that you do not use or any 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:54.589
 type of plastic that is similar to a cedÃ© 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.629
 a sandpaper and a pick for 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.100
 use it as a mold but if you're 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.689
 seeing this that maybe you do not have 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.180
 you can so you can see in the 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:04.039
 description of the video a link to a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.190
 template to be able to trim the 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.560
 plastic with the shape of Cuba the first thing 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.649
 what we are going to do is take the plastic or 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.369
 card that we are going to use and mark 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.429
 the shape of the vat you know if you have 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.369
 the quill then put it over and marks 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.890
 but marks with the template that I have 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.229
 said before we put the pick or the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.290
 template on the plastic or in this 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.970
 case the card 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.250
 we mark the form well 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.320
 You can also do this with a CD 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 but I do not recommend it to you since 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.660
 plastic the cde is very thick and would not go 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.880
 well with the barb is also a plastic 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.070
 that does not cut anything right with what is 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 very likely that when cutting it breaks and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.880
 let's cut ourselves 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.910
 and now with the scissors cut by the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.910
 edge that has been marked 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.769
 Now we will use the sandpaper to 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 sand the edges of the tub well 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.329
 that there is no shock so that it does not 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.329
 will not get caught in the ropes 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.280
 and now here is my plectrum look here 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.280
 see how it looks like the pick 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.240
 Well, as you can see, I'm already using 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.940
 the barb that we just made and how 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.930
 it works perfectly 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 at 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.250
 so nothing like I always say if it has 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.890
 liked the video give me I like and
