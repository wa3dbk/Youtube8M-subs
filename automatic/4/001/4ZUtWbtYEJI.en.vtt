00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
you know when it starts to get cold in

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.259 
you know when it starts to get cold in
the<00:00:12.110> South<00:00:12.320> get<00:00:12.830> on<00:00:12.950> these<00:00:13.129> lakes<00:00:13.429> and<00:00:13.759> to<00:00:14.150> me

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
the South get on these lakes and to me

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.489 
the South get on these lakes and to me
that's<00:00:14.419> the<00:00:14.570> time<00:00:14.809> when<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.169> Schuyler

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:15.499 
that's the time when the Schuyler

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:16.960 
that's the time when the Schuyler
crankbait<00:00:15.950> bite<00:00:16.160> and<00:00:16.370> the<00:00:16.430> crankbait<00:00:16.820> bite

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
crankbait bite and the crankbait bite

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.580 
crankbait bite and the crankbait bite
start<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.390> get<00:00:17.510> back<00:00:17.660> on<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:18.199> know<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:18.380> can

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
start to get back on you know you can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.620 
start to get back on you know you can
catch<00:00:18.800> fish<00:00:19.039> all<00:00:19.310> summer<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.359> really

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
catch fish all summer and really

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.750 
catch fish all summer and really
throughout<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.439> early<00:00:21.769> fall<00:00:22.039> on<00:00:22.340> mashella

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
throughout the early fall on mashella

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.150 
throughout the early fall on mashella
crankbaits<00:00:23.269> but<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:24.320> know<00:00:24.439> when<00:00:24.920> it<00:00:25.010> gets

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
crankbaits but you know when it gets

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.640 
crankbaits but you know when it gets
cold<00:00:25.429> again<00:00:25.609> that's<00:00:26.269> definitely<00:00:26.929> when<00:00:27.529> I

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
cold again that's definitely when I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.450 
cold again that's definitely when I
start<00:00:28.039> thinking

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
start thinking

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.339 
start thinking
there<00:00:28.849> goes<00:00:29.060> shallow<00:00:29.300> cranking<00:00:29.750> again<00:00:29.990> cuz<00:00:30.230> it

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
there goes shallow cranking again cuz it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.770 
there goes shallow cranking again cuz it
I<00:00:30.529> think<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.609> fish<00:00:31.789> start<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.210> pull

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
I think the the fish start to pull

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.360 
I think the the fish start to pull
towards<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.200> bank<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.590> little<00:00:33.620> bit<00:00:33.980> they're

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
towards the bank a little bit they're

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.250 
towards the bank a little bit they're
not<00:00:34.520> as<00:00:34.610> scattered<00:00:35.210> quite<00:00:35.510> as<00:00:35.629> much<00:00:35.870> they

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
not as scattered quite as much they

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.040 
not as scattered quite as much they
start<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.649> group<00:00:36.860> up<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.250> little<00:00:37.430> bit<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:38.050> you

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
start to group up a little bit and you

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.990 
start to group up a little bit and you
know<00:00:39.079> just<00:00:39.350> over<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.680> course<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:40.010> my<00:00:40.160> career<00:00:40.460> I

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
know just over the course of my career I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.400 
know just over the course of my career I
fished<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.300> lot<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.570> tournaments<00:00:41.840> in<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.170> fall

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
fished a lot of tournaments in the fall

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.029 
fished a lot of tournaments in the fall
early<00:00:43.190> on<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:44.660> relied<00:00:45.170> heavily<00:00:45.199> on<00:00:45.860> a

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
early on and I relied heavily on a

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.520 
early on and I relied heavily on a
shallow<00:00:46.340> crank<00:00:46.670> bait<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.030> do<00:00:47.719> well<00:00:47.930> that's<00:00:48.260> one

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
shallow crank bait to do well that's one

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.229 
shallow crank bait to do well that's one
of<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.680> reasons<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.100> still<00:00:49.370> love<00:00:49.640> go<00:00:50.000> throwing

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
of the reasons I still love go throwing

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.000 
of the reasons I still love go throwing
that<00:00:50.360> crank<00:00:50.600> bait<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.899> fall<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.800> know<00:00:51.920> in

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
that crank bait in the fall you know in

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.340 
that crank bait in the fall you know in
the<00:00:52.070> late<00:00:52.250> fall<00:00:52.520> early<00:00:52.850> winter<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.870> really<00:00:54.170> like

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
to have a couple different type of crank

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.029 
to have a couple different type of crank
baits<00:00:56.149> out<00:00:56.359> because<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.690> feel<00:00:56.899> like<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.140> the

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
baits out because I feel like that the

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.340 
baits out because I feel like that the
this<00:00:58.280> fish<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:58.789> time<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.149> year<00:00:59.180> some<00:01:00.109> of<00:01:00.260> them

this fish that time of year some of them

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.080 
this fish that time of year some of them
will<00:01:00.469> want<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.739> key<00:01:00.920> on<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.129> certain<00:01:01.789> particular

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
type of vibration and sometimes you know

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.030 
type of vibration and sometimes you know
they<00:01:07.040> want<00:01:07.220> others<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:07.940> just<00:01:08.150> not<00:01:09.040> it's
