00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
afford this name-brand
so<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.290> creates<00:02:28.530> an<00:02:28.620> even

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
so I think it kind of creates an even

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.090 
so I think it kind of creates an even
playing<00:02:29.100> field<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.660> comparative<00:02:31.590> nature

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
playing field for the comparative nature

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160 
playing field for the comparative nature
of<00:02:32.370> who's<00:02:32.670> wearing<00:02:32.940> what<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.510> how<00:02:33.660> your

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
of who's wearing what and how your

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.100 
of who's wearing what and how your
appearance<00:02:34.739> can<00:02:35.100> be<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.640> big<00:02:36.269> problem<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.959> high

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
appearance can be a big problem in high

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.390 
appearance can be a big problem in high
school<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.410> think<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.799> takes<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.190> huge

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
school I think it takes a huge

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.009 
school I think it takes a huge
percentage<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.180> away<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.540> you're

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
percentage of that away so you're

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.360 
percentage of that away so you're
avoiding<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> lot<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.890> danger<00:02:41.250> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
avoiding a lot of that danger of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.520 
avoiding a lot of that danger of
bullying<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.209> being<00:02:42.750> singled<00:02:43.110> out<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
bullying and and being singled out in a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.289 
bullying and and being singled out in a
negative<00:02:43.890> way<00:02:44.100> when<00:02:44.670> someone<00:02:44.940> looked<00:02:45.209> at

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
negative way when someone looked at

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.060 
negative way when someone looked at
someone<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.959> can't<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.410> judge<00:02:46.650> them<00:02:46.920> by

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
someone they can't just judge them by

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.819 
someone they can't just judge them by

what they're wearing or by how they look

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.420
