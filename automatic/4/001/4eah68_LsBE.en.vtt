00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.720 
franchise I think that that's a hard
thing<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:21.990> anybody<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.680> choose<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.580> add

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
thing for anybody to choose and to add

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
thing for anybody to choose and to add
mean<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.210> basically<00:00:24.750> shattered<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
mean they basically shattered the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.460 
mean they basically shattered the
records<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.449> know<00:00:27.449> any<00:00:27.720> entertainment

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
records for know any entertainment

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.950 
records for know any entertainment
within<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.099> week<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.480> mean<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> make

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
within the first week so I mean to make

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.280 
within the first week so I mean to make
a<00:00:31.230> claim<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.930> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.989> little

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
a claim like that I think it is a little

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.150 
a claim like that I think it is a little
bit<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.820> too<00:00:35.910> far<00:00:36.440> but<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.710> would

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
bit going a little too far but I would

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
bit going a little too far but I would
hope<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> people<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.870> our<00:00:40.050> game

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
hope that people really like our game

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
hope that people really like our game
and<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.920> buy<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.969> think

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and they buy it not because they think

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
and they buy it not because they think
it's<00:00:42.329> necessarily<00:00:42.690> better<00:00:43.079> than<00:00:43.410> another

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's necessarily better than another

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
it's necessarily better than another
game<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.020> like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
game but because they really really like

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.840 
game but because they really really like
it<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> provides<00:00:47.399> them<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> good

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.970 
it and it provides them a good
experience<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.770> we're

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
experience and that's more what we're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970 
experience and that's more what we're
looking<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.570> specifically<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
looking to do not to specifically how to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880 
looking to do not to specifically how to
do<00:00:53.370> infinity<00:00:54.329> ward<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:54.719> modern<00:00:55.050> warfare<00:00:55.260> 2<00:00:55.620> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
do infinity ward or modern warfare 2 but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.250 
do infinity ward or modern warfare 2 but
to<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.309> provide<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> game<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.260> players

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to just provide a game that players

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.279

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
hopefully that reflects with sales

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
hopefully that reflects with sales
because<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.870> gives<00:01:04.019> us<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.439> money<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.799> keep

because that gives us more money to keep

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
because that gives us more money to keep
going<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.760> games<00:01:06.260> we<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.500> still

going and make more games we are still

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
going and make more games we are still
quite<00:01:08.310> young<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.299> single-player<00:01:09.689> venue

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
quite young in the single-player venue

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.270 
quite young in the single-player venue
and<00:01:11.070> people<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.729> followed<00:01:12.210> dice<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:13.619> history

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and people have followed dice is history

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
and people have followed dice is history
with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> Battlefield<00:01:15.090> franchise<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.110> been

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
with the Battlefield franchise it's been

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.820 
with the Battlefield franchise it's been
significantly<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:17.820> multiplayer<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
significantly or only multiplayer so you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.380 
significantly or only multiplayer so you
know<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> something<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:20.790> new<00:01:21.000> person

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
know this is something that's new person

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.700 
know this is something that's new person
we're<00:01:21.509> exploring<00:01:21.990> different<00:01:22.290> ways<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
we're exploring different ways to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
we're exploring different ways to
reflect<00:01:23.400> battlefield<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.479> single<00:01:24.810> player

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
reflect battlefield in a single player

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
reflect battlefield in a single player
and<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.369> good<00:01:26.610> job<00:01:26.640> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and I think we do a really good job of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
and I think we do a really good job of
really<00:01:27.689> combining<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.729> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
really combining that but also but that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
really combining that but also but that
makes<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> difficult<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> express

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
makes it difficult to how do you express

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.730 
makes it difficult to how do you express
a<00:01:31.799> story<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.900> adventure<00:01:34.470> across

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a story really get the adventure across

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
a story really get the adventure across
and<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> we're

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and do that and I think that we're

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
and do that and I think that we're
getting<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.680> better<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> think

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
getting a lot better at that and I think

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.370 
getting a lot better at that and I think
people<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> feel<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
people are going to feel that more this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
people are going to feel that more this
one<00:01:40.530> where's<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> original<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:42.180> very

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
one where's the original one was very

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.480 
one where's the original one was very
open<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.140> something<00:01:43.439> sometimes<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.130> open

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
open it was something sometimes to open

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.999 
open it was something sometimes to open
you've<00:01:45.000> spent<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> time<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.350> driving

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
you've spent a lot of time just driving

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.320 
you've spent a lot of time just driving
along<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.520> no

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
along with no

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.510 
along with no
happening<00:01:48.690> in<00:01:48.780> between<00:01:49.170> those<00:01:49.380> moments<00:01:49.680> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
happening in between those moments so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
happening in between those moments so
this<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:50.970> we've<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.480> of<00:01:51.510> refine<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.110> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this time we've kind of refine that so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
this time we've kind of refine that so
sometimes<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> passenger<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
sometimes you're the passenger and you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
sometimes you're the passenger and you
do<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.020> intuitively<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.160> get<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.460> as

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
do it intuitively so when you get in as

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
do it intuitively so when you get in as
a<00:01:56.640> gunner<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.330> know<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.960> role<00:01:58.170> so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
a gunner you know that's your role so

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
a gunner you know that's your role so
your<00:01:59.010> your<00:01:59.310> focus<00:01:59.730> on<00:01:59.880> being<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.240> gunner<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
your your focus on being a gunner and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.720 
your your focus on being a gunner and
you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.050> a<00:02:01.110> pilot<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.590> he's<00:02:01.980> flying<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.580> and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
you have a pilot and he's flying it and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.130 
you have a pilot and he's flying it and
you<00:02:02.820> feel<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.510> guy<00:02:03.840> that's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you feel like that's your guy that's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
you feel like that's your guy that's
your<00:02:04.410> your<00:02:04.920> team<00:02:05.130> name<00:02:05.310> he<00:02:05.850> lands<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.360> just

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
your your team name he lands it just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
your your team name he lands it just
like<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.080> multiplayer<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.070> then

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
like you would in multiplayer and then

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
like you would in multiplayer and then
you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.880> you're<00:02:09.090> doing<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.510> fight

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you get out and you're doing the fight

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440 
you get out and you're doing the fight
so<00:02:09.960> it<00:02:10.260> flows<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.910> would<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so it flows like you would kind of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.640 
so it flows like you would kind of
expect<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.460> multiplayer<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.600> know<00:02:16.440> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
expect to in the multiplayer I know it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040 
expect to in the multiplayer I know it
is<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.310> screams<00:02:18.060> co-op<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.780> don't

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
is like it screams co-op but we don't

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.230 
is like it screams co-op but we don't
have<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.160> unfortunately<00:02:21.150> in

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
have a lot on this one unfortunately in

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.670 
have a lot on this one unfortunately in
it<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.960> something<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.560> have

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
it but it is something that we have

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.190 
it but it is something that we have
looked<00:02:22.830> at<00:02:23.010> we're<00:02:23.310> exploring<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.600> how<00:02:24.810> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
looked at we're exploring to see how we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.070 
looked at we're exploring to see how we
could<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.770> do<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> great<00:02:26.910> way<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
could I do that in a great way and it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.620 
could I do that in a great way and it
sometimes<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.030> bad<00:02:30.030> thing<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.480> sometimes

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
sometimes it's a bad thing and sometimes

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780 
sometimes it's a bad thing and sometimes
it's<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.020> good<00:02:31.170> thing<00:02:31.320> but<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:32.040> dice<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.670> are

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790

very very passionate and when we do

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.340 
very very passionate and when we do
something<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.370> need<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.060> bring<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.570> home<00:02:36.930> like

connected with those personalities so we

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.090 
connected with those personalities so we
have<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> same<00:03:00.750> guys<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.260> same<00:03:01.410> voice<00:03:01.650> actors

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100

the<00:03:02.280> same<00:03:02.489> squad<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.200> put<00:03:04.470> any<00:03:04.739> normal

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the same squad but if you put any normal

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.220 
the same squad but if you put any normal
person<00:03:05.370> into<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> different<00:03:06.269> situation<00:03:06.450> when

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
person into a different situation when

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.350 
person into a different situation when
the<00:03:07.320> stakes<00:03:07.620> are<00:03:07.860> different<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.880> respond

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the stakes are different if you respond

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.030 
the stakes are different if you respond
differently<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.320> still<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.830> their

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
differently so they still have their

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.800 
differently so they still have their
personalities<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.940> they<00:03:12.030> still<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.720> know

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
personalities and they still you know

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.270 
personalities and they still you know
make<00:03:13.019> their<00:03:13.290> jokes<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.890> things<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.220> that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
make their jokes and things like that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.220 
make their jokes and things like that
but<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:14.970> appropriate<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:16.080> their

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
but it's appropriate to their

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.140 
but it's appropriate to their
environment<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.550> key<00:03:17.730> thing<00:03:17.760> that

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
environment and that's a key thing that

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.729 
environment and that's a key thing that
you<00:03:18.269> do<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.140> characters<00:03:19.500> feel

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you do because then the characters feel

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.040 
you do because then the characters feel
believable<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:21.300> makes<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.780> connection

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
believable and it makes a connection

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.440 
believable and it makes a connection

the<00:03:32.970> kind<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.180> game<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.360> we<00:03:33.600> build<00:03:33.920> i<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:35.550> to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
the kind of game that we build i like to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
the kind of game that we build i like to
see<00:03:35.880> i<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> our<00:03:36.750> multiplayer<00:03:37.200> is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
see i think that our multiplayer is

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.860 
see i think that our multiplayer is
definitely<00:03:37.680> better<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.880> i<00:03:39.300> would<00:03:39.630> like<00:03:39.780> to

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
definitely better and i would like to

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.300 
definitely better and i would like to
point<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.140> out<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.590> because<00:03:40.890> we<00:03:41.160> have

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
point that out that it's because we have

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.490 
point that out that it's because we have
vehicles<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.390> huge<00:03:42.630> open<00:03:43.050> sandbox

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
vehicles we have the huge open sandbox

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.590 
vehicles we have the huge open sandbox
environments<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.700> we<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> destruction

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
environments and we have the destruction

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.050 
environments and we have the destruction
so<00:03:46.200> these<00:03:46.470> are<00:03:46.530> key<00:03:46.980> things<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.489> us<00:03:47.700> addresses

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
so these are key things for us addresses

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.820 
so these are key things for us addresses
apart<00:03:48.540> from<00:03:48.870> from<00:03:49.470> our<00:03:49.620> competition

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830
