00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
 hello everyone with you sharks vlog today i 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.769
 tell you about aquarium spray ah 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.460
 they are needed to equip 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.460
 oxygen aquarium water 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.470
 sprayer and there is a huge amount 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 types of flowers and what they just do not have 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:33.469
 there are tubular cylindrical they 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.079
 are soft 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:43.200
 two different colors you want 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:46.020
 shore enough to connect this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.129
 spray for example take here such 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.379
 hose and connect it to this 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.960
 sprayer and then lower it to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 aquarium after which 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.510
 turn on the compressor and it starts 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.540
 work bubbles come out of it 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 everyone is tougher camera 3 than more about 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.210
 compressed so the bubbles will be less than 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.869
 it is softer and less pressed the larger 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.869
 bubbles 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.410
 here for example here in this can raise 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.170
 these bubbles are much smaller than all the goats 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.450
 such because there is much controversy here 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.450
 less than top hat 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.730
 sprayer consists of finely chop 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.730
 stones pressed to with some glue 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.470
 which I put a straw and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.100
 glued 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 they have here such that they often 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.259
 just break it in half already 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.820
 impossible to glue but it costs about 40 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.720
 rubles 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.620
 good sprayers sprayer 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.900
 be sure to put in the aquarium so 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.730
 like if you have a lot of fish then filters with 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:28.299
 this filter just can't handle it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:33.790
 mounted on the suction cup you can glue 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.790
 in any and the bottom is not on the wall 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.730
 this is all a story about the compressor and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.200
 came to an end 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.090
