and sleek phone I'll show you here see
you<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.549> finger<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.150> compared

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you here this is my finger and compared

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.170 
you here this is my finger and compared
to<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> phone<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.690> has<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> voice<00:02:33.720> control<00:02:34.720> here

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
to the phone it has a voice control here

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.600 
to the phone it has a voice control here
the<00:02:37.180> talk<00:02:37.450> time<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.049> phone<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.560> about<00:02:38.739> 5.5

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the talk time of the phone is about 5.5

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.130 
the talk time of the phone is about 5.5
hours<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.390> standby<00:02:40.810> time<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:42.209> 15<00:02:43.209> days<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
hours the standby time is 15 days and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.170 
hours the standby time is 15 days and
this<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.500> rim<00:02:44.709> specs<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.400> expect<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:46.000> little

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
this is the rim specs so expect a little

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.240 
this is the rim specs so expect a little
bit<00:02:46.299> less<00:02:46.629> than<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.739> rim<00:02:47.920> specs

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
bit less than that because the rim specs

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.449 
bit less than that because the rim specs
are<00:02:48.400> usually<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:50.049> we<00:02:50.290> usually<00:02:50.620> manufacture

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
are usually the we usually manufacture

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.979 
are usually the we usually manufacture
specs<00:02:51.819> are<00:02:51.970> usually<00:02:52.239> higher<00:02:52.510> than<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:52.959> you

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
specs are usually higher than what you

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.479 
specs are usually higher than what you
actually<00:02:53.290> get<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.860> make<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.040> seem<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> little

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
actually get to make it seem a little

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.190 
actually get to make it seem a little
bit<00:02:54.670> better<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.510> clear<00:02:58.750> display

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
bit better it's really clear display

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.090 
bit better it's really clear display

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
what's 176 by 144 so that's pretty good

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.910 
what's 176 by 144 so that's pretty good
it<00:04:04.920> has<00:04:05.040> GPS<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.970> GPS<00:04:06.390> which<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.320> GPS<00:04:07.740> is

it has GPS and a GPS which is a GPS is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.240 
it has GPS and a GPS which is a GPS is

complex and as a little bit more

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.310 
complex and as a little bit more

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
and G does not have n because actually I

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.880 
and G does not have n because actually I
don't<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.020> phone<00:04:19.500> would<00:04:19.650> even

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
don't think that's phone would even

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.550 
don't think that's phone would even
support<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.550> because<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.060> fact<00:04:21.300> that<00:04:21.560> n

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
support and because of the fact that n

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.340 
support and because of the fact that n
is<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:23.580> newer<00:04:23.820> type<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.780> Wi-Fi<00:04:25.200> that's

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
is a really newer type of Wi-Fi that's

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.560 
is a really newer type of Wi-Fi that's
up<00:04:25.710> probably<00:04:26.250> significantly<00:04:26.910> faster<00:04:27.120> than<00:04:27.330> B

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
up probably significantly faster than B

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.660 
up probably significantly faster than B
and<00:04:27.750> G<00:04:27.930> but<00:04:28.350> B<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.680> G<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.890> really<00:04:29.040> all<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.340> need

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
better without the extreme lighting

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.700 
better without the extreme lighting
there<00:07:07.670> and<00:07:08.060> I'll<00:07:08.300> here<00:07:08.810> I'll<00:07:08.930> go<00:07:09.290> ahead<00:07:09.440> and

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
there and I'll here I'll go ahead and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.640 
there and I'll here I'll go ahead and
turn<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:10.270> phone<00:07:11.270> light<00:07:11.810> on<00:07:11.990> while<00:07:12.290> because

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
turn the phone light on while because

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.900 
turn the phone light on while because
you<00:07:12.740> can<00:07:12.860> do<00:07:12.980> that<00:07:13.100> while<00:07:13.250> you're<00:07:13.400> recording<00:07:13.730> a

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
you can do that while you're recording a

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.940 
you can do that while you're recording a
video<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:17.140> here<00:07:18.140> it<00:07:18.200> is<00:07:18.290> with<00:07:18.470> the<00:07:18.500> phone

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
video and here it is with the phone

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.420 
video and here it is with the phone
light<00:07:19.220> on<00:07:19.430> so<00:07:19.970> a<00:07:20.560> little<00:07:21.560> bright<00:07:21.800> it<00:07:22.010> uses<00:07:22.310> the

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
light on so a little bright it uses the

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.820 
light on so a little bright it uses the
flash<00:07:22.700> just<00:07:23.180> as<00:07:23.300> a<00:07:23.330> light<00:07:23.990> for<00:07:24.230> the<00:07:24.260> video

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
flash just as a light for the video

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:34.839 
flash just as a light for the video
camera<00:07:25.010> so<00:07:25.370> that's<00:07:25.430> pretty<00:07:25.640> good

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:34.849 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.089 

I'd<00:07:35.389> also<00:07:35.569> like<00:07:35.779> the<00:07:35.899> add<00:07:36.050> via<00:07:36.349> speed<00:07:36.889> of<00:07:37.009> the

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099 
I'd also like the add via speed of the

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:39.089 
I'd also like the add via speed of the
processor<00:07:37.819> and<00:07:37.849> the<00:07:37.999> amount<00:07:38.209> of<00:07:38.300> RAM<00:07:38.599> it<00:07:38.839> has

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:39.099 
processor and the amount of RAM it has

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:44.109 
processor and the amount of RAM it has
the<00:07:40.099> 8900<00:07:40.699> comes<00:07:40.969> with<00:07:41.179> a<00:07:42.459> 256<00:07:43.459> megabytes<00:07:43.729> of

00:07:44.109 --> 00:07:44.119 
the 8900 comes with a 256 megabytes of

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:47.559 
the 8900 comes with a 256 megabytes of
RAM<00:07:44.360> and<00:07:44.659> a<00:07:45.169> 512<00:07:46.069> megahertz<00:07:46.610> processor<00:07:46.849> so

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:47.569 
RAM and a 512 megahertz processor so

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:51.449 
RAM and a 512 megahertz processor so
that's<00:07:47.749> a<00:07:47.929> really<00:07:48.770> damn<00:07:49.009> good<00:07:49.039> for<00:07:49.520> a<00:07:49.550> phone
