the<00:05:55.219> idea<00:05:55.549> of<00:05:55.639> the<00:05:55.879> dish<00:05:56.119> is<00:05:56.479> not<00:05:56.869> to<00:05:57.110> eat<00:05:57.229> it

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
the idea of the dish is not to eat it

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:58.899 
the idea of the dish is not to eat it
like<00:05:57.529> that<00:05:57.709> because<00:05:57.860> what<00:05:58.159> people<00:05:58.549> would<00:05:58.669> do

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
like that because what people would do

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.299 
like that because what people would do
is<00:05:59.419> go<00:05:59.629> straight<00:05:59.959> for<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.199> chocolate<00:06:00.679> and<00:06:00.860> not

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:01.309 
is go straight for the chocolate and not

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:03.459 
is go straight for the chocolate and not
being<00:06:01.459> able<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.849> taste<00:06:02.059> the<00:06:02.479> coconut<00:06:02.869> after

being able to taste the coconut after
that<00:06:03.619> so<00:06:04.219> the<00:06:04.849> other<00:06:04.879> interesting<00:06:05.360> part<00:06:05.929> is

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
that so the other interesting part is

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.589 
that so the other interesting part is
the<00:06:06.259> dishes<00:06:06.649> you<00:06:06.829> push<00:06:07.279> and<00:06:07.669> you<00:06:08.089> force<00:06:08.389> the
