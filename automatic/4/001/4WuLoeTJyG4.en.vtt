going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> school<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.739> are<00:03:01.830> supporting<00:03:02.459> at

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
going to school we are supporting at

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.270 
going to school we are supporting at
least<00:03:02.850> 300<00:03:03.269> farmers<00:03:03.780> directly<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.709> mean<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.130> he

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
least 300 farmers directly I mean if he

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.890 
least 300 farmers directly I mean if he
was<00:03:05.400> giving<00:03:05.760> technical<00:03:06.209> advice<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.720> them

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
was giving technical advice to them

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.770 
was giving technical advice to them
under<00:03:07.650> ectly<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.489> could<00:03:08.700> say<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:08.940> all<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
under ectly we could say that all the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.350 
under ectly we could say that all the
fruit<00:03:10.049> sector<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.799> benefiting<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.150> also

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
fruit sector is benefiting we can also

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.830 
fruit sector is benefiting we can also
talk<00:03:12.720> about<00:03:12.780> 10,000<00:03:13.709> farmers<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:15.660> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
talk about 10,000 farmers and it is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.990 
talk about 10,000 farmers and it is
expanding<00:03:16.620> day<00:03:16.769> by<00:03:16.950> day<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.579> farmers

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
expanding day by day because the farmers

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.670 
expanding day by day because the farmers
they<00:03:18.120> are<00:03:18.180> copying<00:03:18.660> from<00:03:18.900> each<00:03:19.049> other<00:03:19.320> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
they are copying from each other and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.670 
they are copying from each other and
they<00:03:20.160> want<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.579> follow<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.959> example<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.500> our

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
they want to follow the example of our

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.380 
they want to follow the example of our
model<00:03:23.160> formats<00:03:23.959> yeah<00:03:26.060> temperate<00:03:27.060> fruit

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
model formats yeah temperate fruit

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.600 
model formats yeah temperate fruit
production<00:03:27.959> requires<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.769> high<00:03:29.070> level<00:03:29.430> of
