00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
field for instance when I research

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.410 
field for instance when I research
scientific<00:05:35.710> illustration<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:37.000> know<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.360> I

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
scientific illustration you know and I

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.760 
scientific illustration you know and I
started<00:05:37.720> learning<00:05:37.840> about<00:05:38.110> more<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.500> that

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
started learning about more of that

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
extremely accurate detailed drawings

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.780 
extremely accurate detailed drawings
which<00:05:44.410> really<00:05:44.740> works<00:05:44.920> for<00:05:45.070> me<00:05:45.310> because<00:05:45.640> that's

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
which really works for me because that's

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.120 
which really works for me because that's
the<00:05:46.030> way<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.150> draw<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.750> like<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:47.590> realism

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
the way I draw I like that realism

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.070 
the way I draw I like that realism
wouldn't<00:05:49.000> really<00:05:49.120> work<00:05:49.420> out<00:05:49.570> pretty<00:05:49.780> well<00:05:49.900> for

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
wouldn't really work out pretty well for

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.450 
wouldn't really work out pretty well for
me<00:05:50.290> though<00:05:50.500> if<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.800> was<00:05:50.920> interested<00:05:51.400> in

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
me though if I was interested in
