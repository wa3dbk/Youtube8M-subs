hello any offers science needs you this

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.809 
hello any offers science needs you this
March<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:04.799> part<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.160> bigger<00:00:05.460> project

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
March we're part of a bigger project

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.330 
March we're part of a bigger project
that's<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.930> using<00:00:07.080> Lindy<00:00:07.680> Hop<00:00:07.890> to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
that's going to be using Lindy Hop to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.860 
that's going to be using Lindy Hop to
help<00:00:08.490> explain<00:00:08.820> some<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> mysteries<00:00:09.660> of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
help explain some of the mysteries of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.709 
help explain some of the mysteries of
quantum<00:00:10.349> physics<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:11.250> particular<00:00:11.759> we're

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
quantum physics in particular we're

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.049 
quantum physics in particular we're
going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.960> showing<00:00:13.170> how<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.460> build<00:00:14.759> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
going to be showing how you can build a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.359 
going to be showing how you can build a

of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.730> laws<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> physics<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:19.560> going

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
of the laws of physics and we're going

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.910 
of the laws of physics and we're going
to<00:00:19.710> use<00:00:19.890> Lindy<00:00:20.490> Hop<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.180> demonstrate<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.920> but

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to use Lindy Hop to demonstrate this but

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.480 
to use Lindy Hop to demonstrate this but
we<00:00:23.490> need<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.850> help<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:26.010> we're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
we need your help so what we're going to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.300 
we need your help so what we're going to
do<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.810> different<00:00:28.230> scenes<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:28.980> all

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
do is get different scenes from all

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.209 
do is get different scenes from all
around<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> world<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.990> come<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> dance

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
around the world to come out and dance

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
le Cheyne and Jess we're going to run
through<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.920> entire<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.820> us<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.119> five

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
through the entire thing for us so five

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
through the entire thing for us so five
six<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:11.010> swing<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:11.880> close<00:01:12.090> nice

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
six here we go swing up from close nice

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
six here we go swing up from close nice
Frankie<00:01:12.900> straight<00:01:13.140> swing<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.820> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
Frankie straight swing out and then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.190 
Frankie straight swing out and then
we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> come<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.080> another

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
we're going to come in and do another

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
we're going to come in and do another
swing<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:19.080> nice<00:01:19.229> circle<00:01:21.320> into<00:01:22.320> our

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
swing out and a nice circle into our

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.500 
swing out and a nice circle into our

do it again shoot duck shut up in you to

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.600 
do it again shoot duck shut up in you to
our<00:01:52.840> circle<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:54.160> is<00:01:54.310> where<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:54.490> do<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
our circle this is where we do a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.340 
our circle this is where we do a
six-count<00:01:55.150> tuck<00:01:55.420> turn<00:01:55.630> where<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.930> change<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
six-count tuck turn where we change the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.219 
six-count tuck turn where we change the
hands<00:01:56.770> these<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.789> hands<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.509> catch<00:01:59.080> the
