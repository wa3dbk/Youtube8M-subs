00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
mesh crew I think it's nice because it

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
mesh crew I think it's nice because it
just<00:01:10.049> gives<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> opportunity<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.369> get

just gives them the opportunity to get

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.390 
just gives them the opportunity to get
where<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> actually<00:01:13.710> competing<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
where I'm at and actually competing and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.630 
where I'm at and actually competing and
doing<00:01:14.760> pro<00:01:15.270> events<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> skateboarder

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
doing pro events as a skateboarder

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
doing pro events as a skateboarder
definitely<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.630> hard<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.979> street

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
definitely it's hard to be on the street

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
definitely it's hard to be on the street
you<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.670> kicked<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> spot<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.840> you're<00:01:21.960> not

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you get kicked out of spot so you're not

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
you get kicked out of spot so you're not
supposed<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.530> skating<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
if you give them a place to be like this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
if you give them a place to be like this
pizza<00:01:25.860> place<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> skate<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> comments
