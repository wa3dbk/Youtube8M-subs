00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 i 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.270
 i 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.759
 she always felt afraid or sorry that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.130
 to look at her that her not to look the cnel 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.250
 sideways then up to hiding 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.040
 that part of her has been masterful of 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 loves more than 40 friends 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.260
 life man was eager to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.860
 correcting his nose he did not like the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.860
 nose we told him not what 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.230
 nice house that was nice but not 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.450
 I said here when you could help 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.989
 correcting the nose has been all life 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.580
 her dream since she was a little girl 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.950
 I started here she wanted to have her nose operated 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:02.050
 then all life since I was a little girl 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.050
 I had that desire because she lived 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.880
 pepsi with their nose they saw very little sad 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.830
 I'm not going to believe that the distance 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 Buys a lot through the nose but it's good 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 lukewarm the tibia hid me too 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 I think it's very important that I do not 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.290
 feel fulfilled 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.300
 the 60 performed and the results were 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.820
 good were excellent experiences 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.290
 psychologically I think that many 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 people have become too close 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.490
 but jenni has been the happiest is a 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.659
 supremely different person in all 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.190
 in everything in in his way of expressing himself already 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.190
 I think he feels safe and firm 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.310
 it feels fulfilled and I know that every day 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.710
 to be better she is more positive no longer 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.080
 she's so shy she shows more and she wants 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.880
 photos feels very good because I 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 I tell them that I always support moms with 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.830
 what they want because it is very important 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.040
 the support of both the family and one 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.290
 that is more the son the other part of it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.850
 it's going to be a positive change for her 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.200
 also at the beginning I had then look 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.190
 look because he does not know how he's going to look 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.890
 or lass 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.680
 the one that will happen to you with the course 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 of time but there was not an ex centered 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.430
 the doctor looks great is very aesthetic 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.599
 good 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.970
 to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 I always had that thought I did not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.910
 I liked the shape of my nose 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.910
 and I said someday I'm going to do it 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.880
 the island if it burns and still with 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.760
 the time and nothing else 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.160
 it was something that I always had since I was a girl and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.870
 thank god I could make the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.990
 doctor Alvaro coloring I met him by 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.780
 half of a colleague told us that 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.200
 had operated on the sister and there was 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.930
 been very positive and started telling me about 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.030
 him because I'm interested 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.140
 and I told me not to Data Doctor 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.690
 my son 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.970
 he is like that he is a man of much 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.800
 charisma and you can see it on the internet him 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.430
 has the page on the internet I to good 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.020
 when I saw it on the page I said 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.720
 he is the one who is going to operate me is a doctor 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:51.110
 of much charisma of much respect 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.230
 for the patient is a doctor who listens 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.060
 the patient is a doctor who suggests 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.840
 the patient how he's doing and how not to do 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.950
 aspects would be better on the face 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.310
 Dr. Álvaro is a man who loves his 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.739
 profession that knows what it does and how 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.950
 treat your patient and not only that 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.470
 always pending is a process that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.490
 he goes hand in hand with the patient 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.949
 leave the myth that it does not hurt 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.580
 all surgery has its process but not 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.550
 it hurt 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.849
 and it burns the reward of looking good 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.919
 so nice then that they are encouraged that 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.370
 nothing and it does not matter I'm in nothing 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.120
 mature so I say I'm asking or 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.090
 better or better time at my best time 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.789
 because I already as a mother I am happy as 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.009
 also employed as a daughter as a sister 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.719
 as a friend then I wanted 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.509
 find myself as that part of myself 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:58.469
 what I needed is very rich that 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.129
 project that is more beautiful than people 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:04.759
 let me tell you how beautiful it is 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.190
 example my son mommy how cute 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.800
 so that's very positive because that 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.620
 It makes you want to live makes you want to 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.050
 do so many things that one in life has 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.530
 gone unnoticed 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.250
 then do not put the batteries that 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.300
 they are projected to love themselves young 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.940
 is that the is not to age anything is to be 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.759
 one more aware of things but 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.759
 physically one should always be fine 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.200
 ah 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.320
 ah
