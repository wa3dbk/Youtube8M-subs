all these cells and I will have a video

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.470 
all these cells and I will have a video
soon<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.250> construction<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
soon about the construction of this

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
went through the steps and this shelf

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.780 
went through the steps and this shelf
that<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.850> working<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:10.130> there's<00:02:11.130> all<00:02:11.310> recycled

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that I'm working on there's all recycled

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:25.150 
that I'm working on there's all recycled
materials<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.750> was<00:02:15.870> free<00:02:17.090> free

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.210 

okay<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.459> pushing<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> dirt<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:29.040> each

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
okay so I'm pushing the dirt in to each

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.360 
okay so I'm pushing the dirt in to each
of<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> pockets<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.170> idea<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.650> these

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
of the pockets I like the idea of these

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.900 
of the pockets I like the idea of these
soil<00:02:35.760> blocks<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.800> I'm<00:02:37.920> gonna<00:02:38.070> try<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.730> at

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
soil blocks and I'm gonna try that at

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.460 
soil blocks and I'm gonna try that at
some<00:02:39.150> point<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.600> right<00:02:39.780> now<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.020> got<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.320> get

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
some point but right now I got to get

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.030 
some point but right now I got to get
started<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.830> I'm

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
started and this is what I have so I'm

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
started and this is what I have so I'm
just<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.489> pushing<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.030> these<00:02:48.239> into

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
just kind of pushing all of these into

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.690 
just kind of pushing all of these into
the<00:02:48.959> cells

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the cells

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.569 
the cells
it's<00:02:51.700> kind<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.090> honeycomb<00:02:59.579> speaking

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
it's kind of like honeycomb speaking

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.390 
it's kind of like honeycomb speaking
honeycomb<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:01.150> got<00:03:01.299> one<00:03:01.540> mini<00:03:02.129> flying<00:03:03.129> around

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
honeycomb we got one mini flying around

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.360 
honeycomb we got one mini flying around
in<00:03:03.670> here<00:03:04.319> must<00:03:05.319> have<00:03:05.379> found<00:03:05.620> his<00:03:05.769> way<00:03:05.920> into<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
in here must have found his way into the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.490 

oops<00:03:52.520> just<00:03:53.210> coming<00:03:53.540> right<00:03:53.570> out<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:54.050> my<00:03:54.200> seed

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
oops just coming right out in my seed

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.830 
oops just coming right out in my seed
packets<00:03:54.980> I'm<00:03:55.640> gonna<00:03:55.850> sprout<00:03:56.180> all<00:03:56.390> my<00:03:56.540> seeds

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
packets I'm gonna sprout all my seeds

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:07.680 
packets I'm gonna sprout all my seeds
right<00:03:57.080> here<00:03:57.110> on<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.470> desk

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.010 

that's<00:04:08.410> filling<00:04:08.860> in<00:04:08.980> nicely<00:04:09.720> most<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.900> it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
that's filling in nicely most of it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.470 
that's filling in nicely most of it
feels<00:04:11.260> like<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:11.620> getting<00:04:12.040> pretty<00:04:12.430> moist

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.150 

does<00:04:16.480> have<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.840> tray<00:04:17.170> underneath<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.739> too<00:04:17.920> so

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
does have the tray underneath it too so

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.530 
does have the tray underneath it too so
hopefully<00:04:18.280> some<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.670> that<00:04:18.820> water<00:04:19.030> gets<00:04:19.330> down

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
hopefully some of that water gets down

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.330 
hopefully some of that water gets down
in<00:04:19.720> there<00:04:19.840> soaks<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.440> from<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.739> bottom<00:04:21.100> I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
in there soaks it from the bottom I

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.340 
in there soaks it from the bottom I
might<00:04:22.030> actually<00:04:22.210> go<00:04:22.540> ahead<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:22.690> put<00:04:22.990> some<00:04:23.020> in

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
might actually go ahead and put some in

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:42.020 
might actually go ahead and put some in
the<00:04:23.470> bottom<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:40.180> go<00:04:40.330> go<00:04:40.510> ahead<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:40.840> do<00:04:40.960> that

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the bottom you go go ahead and do that

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:52.290 
the bottom you go go ahead and do that
put<00:04:43.030> some<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.540> bottom<00:04:49.920> this<00:04:51.000> subset<00:04:52.000> from

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
put some in the bottom this subset from

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.980 
put some in the bottom this subset from
below<00:04:57.450> I'm<00:04:58.450> sure<00:04:58.630> there's<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.900> better<00:04:59.050> way<00:05:00.990> but

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
below I'm sure there's a better way but

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.870 
below I'm sure there's a better way but
this<00:05:02.170> should<00:05:02.350> work

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.940 

so<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.030> ended<00:05:07.240> up<00:05:07.360> doing<00:05:07.420> was<00:05:07.930> putting<00:05:08.500> a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
so what I ended up doing was putting a

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.250 
so what I ended up doing was putting a
little<00:05:09.790> divot<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.600> pencil<00:05:11.050> in<00:05:11.200> the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
little divot with the pencil in the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260 
little divot with the pencil in the
middle<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.650> each<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.980> these<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.490> then<00:05:13.180> I

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
middle of each of these and then I

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.840 
middle of each of these and then I
dropped<00:05:13.540> two<00:05:13.810> seeds<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.650> then<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.520> go

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
dropped two seeds in and then I just go

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.900 
dropped two seeds in and then I just go
behind<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.660> I'm<00:05:17.250> kind<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.310> just<00:05:18.520> pinching

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
behind and I'm kind of just pinching

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.690 
behind and I'm kind of just pinching
them<00:05:19.000> shut<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:21.120> started<00:05:22.120> out<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:24.580> know<00:05:24.669> a
