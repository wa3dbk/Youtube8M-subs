00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
kind of like the hardest part of the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
kind of like the hardest part of the
glitch<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> still<00:01:32.310> super<00:01:32.579> easy<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> do

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
glitch which is still super easy to do

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
glitch which is still super easy to do
you<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.259> ahead<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.740> look

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you just have to go ahead and look

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.319 
you just have to go ahead and look
straight<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.150> bit

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
straight up into the right a little bit

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.249 
straight up into the right a little bit
and<00:01:36.540> jump<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.470> top<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> higher<00:01:39.750> spot

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and jump on top of like a higher spot

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
and jump on top of like a higher spot
which<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.799> completely<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.310> top<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> map

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which is completely on top of the map

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.280 
which is completely on top of the map
from<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.659> pretty<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:42.960> do

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
from here you can pretty much do

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
from here you can pretty much do
whatever<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.850> top

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
whatever you want because you are on top

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
of the map you just jump around to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.889 
of the map you just jump around to
wherever<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.720> really
