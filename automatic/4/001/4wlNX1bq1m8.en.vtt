00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello together today I'll show you one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.240
 simple manicure as a model I have 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680
 today a man so that you the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 difference before after better 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 You can recognize a manicure 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 of course totally you can modify also 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 Only one hand asked to make a peeling ever 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.520
 what you want, what the customer wants 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 that's really a whole now 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.720
 simplified form I disinfect the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 hands after she was washed me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.230
 of course wear gloves again and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.250
 Just start her with me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.260
 push the cuticle back 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.599
 with this manicure you can now 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.700
 Of course, a cuticle dissolver 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.559
 use around the cuticle one too 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.450
 soft if you generally have problems with 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.130
 I can tell you the cuticle 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.230
 just enter time after showering the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.330
 Cuticle inaugurated with a towel 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.559
 Carefully fold the cuticle backwards 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.010
 push that it is very nice and 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.239
 works very well in any case 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.129
 even if you have a finger bath before 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.230
 the cuticle is natural 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.760
 softened and thus can also be 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.720
 easy time away the whole thing just takes 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 longer in total 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.550
 then i take a cuticle zanger and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.260
 Cut the dead, so to speak 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 skin left off but really only the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.550
 do not start dead around the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 cutting around it can be very 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.479
 bleed heavily and hurt 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
 even if it does not bleed, you open the door 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 and gate for bacteria so there you have to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 really take care that we only have the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 loose little scraps of skin with scissors 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.670
 away 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 You have to take care of that too 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.080
 if you keep the scissors too shallow resp 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 You can hurt yourself there too long 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 so please practice a little bit and all 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 work very carefully if the customer 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.330
 Of course you can not have anything against it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.729
 also with a cutter the cuticle 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 again remove that succeeds me so on 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 best of all, but of course there are 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 Customers who do not necessarily want that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.929
 but that's my tip that here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 once plant if goes along and there 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.420
 also the skin left over with the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 cutter removed 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.119
 then it continues with that I the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.860
 nail in favor i have one here 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 Of course you can also get wood parts 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.729
 others participate but with the succeed 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.100
 it could be very good there anyway 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 now just cut the nail a bit 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 fall into shape and in between, too 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.670
 Always brush the dust with a brush 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.670
 remove 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.260
 next is already at ans polish 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.970
 Men have to get their nails off course 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.010
 do not polish so much I say 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 I found generally stop I would 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.160
 have different polish fall in 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.120
 different strength i will too 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.880
 link again 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 I start with the biggest pillar and 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.900
 go over the entire nail and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.270
 take, so to speak, the fed by gloss layer 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.920
 first of all, of course, carefully 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
 But I'm also in all corners 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.300
 and work very carefully, but with 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.470
 very little pressure to work that is 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.470
 now the first step 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.120
 and I take the second one already 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.520
 page and go again over the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.200
 nail over it and the finer the arrows 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.270
 the smoother the course becomes 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.870
 nail it right up to the end 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.870
 beautiful shines 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.520
 then it goes on once with the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.890
 second line as I take that too 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.990
 a little bigger side and go again 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.910
 then over the complete nail 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.010
 once again remove the dust and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.230
 then only the oil is used many 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.210
 make the mistake of bringing the oil with you 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.500
 a smooth polished page directly 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.270
 polish and that's what makes you the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.980
 celebrate break so the oil is 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.930
 applied if you are still with something 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.360
 coarser side works so take here 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.370
 I now say something oil on the nail 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.080
 massages once and with the coarser ones 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.690
 side of the arrows but also really 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.010
 very fine already polish I am now 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.140
 even that an oil 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.850
 and if you did that, I would 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.460
 stop at one because that sees 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.530
 then still relatively natural, so it 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.090
 actually should not shine so well 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.070
 most men do not want that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.480
 if you can, then you can continue 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.020
 otherwise you will be here now 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.510
 this job finished 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.130
 I'll show you how 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.810
 That looks like the nail 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.060
 Polished is then takes 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 once the polish side and goes over 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.750
 the trouble about please no additional 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.460
 Oil often takes the nail plate 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.470
 on it is enough 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.300
 Also do not work with too much pressure 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.790
 because that can be very hot just 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.380
 again over the entire nail it 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.790
 go and you already see how beautiful 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.690
 it shines and of course now 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.550
 a matter of taste 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.620
 But some men may like that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.610
 if you work on women or on you 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.710
 even that really looks right 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.700
 really great or the place will be 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.700
 you already finished 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.389
 and that's how the final result looks 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.340
 you can make a clear difference 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.229
 recognize the nails look very much now 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.599
 cared for I give my customers too 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.430
 always a tip to the tip every day 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.020
 It's just important to use that 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.029
 for the cuticle for the nailplate 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.129
 if you do not have modular so it and 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.749
 then the nails are generally a lot 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.729
 well-groomed then I hope that you 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.409
 helped small video and that we 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.789
 had fun and if you like see us 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.789
 next time it'll be good again
