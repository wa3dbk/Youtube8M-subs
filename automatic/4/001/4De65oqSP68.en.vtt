00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this be my first time I couldn't think

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
this be my first time I couldn't think
of<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> better<00:01:08.880> time<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.510> exposed<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.080> some

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of a better time to be exposed to some

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.469 
of a better time to be exposed to some
of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> best<00:01:11.490> programs<00:01:11.700> i<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> guard

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of the best programs i think the guard

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
of the best programs i think the guard
has<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:12.990> itself<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> i<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> one

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
has going for itself and i think the one

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.440 
has going for itself and i think the one
that<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.259> members<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.909> at<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> citizen

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that we as as members of at the citizen

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
that we as as members of at the citizen
soldier<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.930> haven't<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.229> taken<00:01:19.439> full

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
soldier we haven't really taken full

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280 
soldier we haven't really taken full

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
outside of the chain it's like that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.859 
outside of the chain it's like that
first<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.100> breeds<00:01:47.430> contempt<00:01:47.970> it
