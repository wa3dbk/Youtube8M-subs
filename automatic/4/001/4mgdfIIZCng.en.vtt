our riding abilities brought on by
really<00:00:04.980> high<00:00:05.190> performance<00:00:05.700> suspension<00:00:05.839> we've

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
really high performance suspension we've

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.780 
really high performance suspension we've
had<00:00:06.990> another<00:00:07.230> really<00:00:07.649> great<00:00:07.890> innovation<00:00:08.580> in

the mountain bike industry in the last
five<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.530> six<00:00:10.740> years<00:00:10.889> which<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.490> tubeless

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
five to six years which is tubeless

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.480 
five to six years which is tubeless
tyres<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.590> tires<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.250> on

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
tyres so just like the tires you have on

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.279 
tyres so just like the tires you have on
like<00:00:14.759> your<00:00:14.910> automobile<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.260> a

like your automobile which don't have a
tube<00:00:16.560> inside<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
tube inside of them they just have you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.320 
tube inside of them they just have you
know<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> sealed<00:00:19.080> tire<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.160> holds<00:00:20.460> air<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:21.210> now

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
know a sealed tire that holds air we now

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.710 
know a sealed tire that holds air we now
have<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.720> bliss<00:00:21.960> bike<00:00:22.170> tires<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.539> what<00:00:24.539> these

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
have two bliss bike tires and what these

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
have two bliss bike tires and what these
tubeless<00:00:25.199> tires<00:00:25.470> allow<00:00:25.800> us<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.460> they

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
tubeless tires allow us to do is they

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.779 
tubeless tires allow us to do is they
allow<00:00:27.090> us<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:28.010> basically<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.279> more

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
allow us to have basically a more

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.440 
allow us to have basically a more
reliable<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> certain<00:00:31.260> extent<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.450> more

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
reliable to a certain extent and more

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.959 
reliable to a certain extent and more
supple<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> efficient<00:00:34.530> ride<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
supple and efficient ride so here is a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.660 
supple and efficient ride so here is a
tubeless<00:00:36.570> rim<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.309> there's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
tubeless rim you can see there's there's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
tubeless rim you can see there's there's
no<00:00:38.820> holes<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.600> anything<00:00:39.930> inside<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.329> for

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
no holes or anything inside of it to for

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
no holes or anything inside of it to for
air<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> leak<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.230> anything<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
air to leak out or anything like that so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
air to leak out or anything like that so
it's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.809> efficient<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.770> structure

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it's a very efficient little structure

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's a very efficient little structure
it's<00:00:47.879> got<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.300> valve<00:00:48.660> stem<00:00:49.550> built<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.789> where<00:00:51.329> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's got a valve stem built in where you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.430 
it's got a valve stem built in where you
put<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> air<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.520> then<00:00:54.440> every

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
put the air in and then every

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.959 
put the air in and then every
manufacturer<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.370> offers<00:00:56.760> both

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
manufacturer pretty much offers both

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.130 
manufacturer pretty much offers both
tube<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.199> type<00:00:58.680> tires<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> drawbacks<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
tube and to type tires the drawbacks of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
tube and to type tires the drawbacks of
to<00:01:01.590> bliss<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to bliss because there have to be

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
to bliss because there have to be
drawback<00:01:02.879> sure<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> talking<00:01:04.170> about

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
drawback sure I want to be talking about

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.039 
drawback sure I want to be talking about
this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> fact<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.090> somewhat

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this is the fact that it is somewhat

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
this is the fact that it is somewhat
more<00:01:07.409> reliable<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.820> problems<00:01:09.090> with

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
more reliable you can have problems with

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
more reliable you can have problems with
tubeless<00:01:09.900> tires<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> could<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.030> with

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
tubeless tires that you could have with

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
tubeless tires that you could have with
a<00:01:12.060> tube<00:01:12.390> tire<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.380> there's<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.650> added

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
a tube tire and then there's these added

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
a tube tire and then there's these added
disadvantages<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.720> big<00:01:16.080> old

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
disadvantages so this this big old

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.660 
disadvantages so this this big old
downhill<00:01:16.650> tire<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:16.979> been<00:01:17.070> set<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> blush

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
downhill tire has been set up to blush

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
downhill tire has been set up to blush
you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> tell<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.630> there's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> bunch<00:01:19.110> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
keeps it from being porous and then you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.960 
keeps it from being porous and then you
need<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:25.950> bit<00:02:26.069> more<00:02:26.310> stiffness<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
need a little bit more stiffness in the

need a little bit more stiffness in the
sidewall<00:02:27.360> because<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.569> don't<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> two

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

sidewall because you don't have a two
minute<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.819> little<00:02:30.060> bit<00:02:30.180> heavier<00:02:30.629> but

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
minute so it's a little bit heavier but

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.070 
minute so it's a little bit heavier but
you<00:02:32.010> take<00:02:32.190> away<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.760> weight<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> tube<00:02:33.810> and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
you take away the weight of the tube and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.519 
you take away the weight of the tube and
you're<00:02:34.830> pretty<00:02:35.129> much<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.459> par
