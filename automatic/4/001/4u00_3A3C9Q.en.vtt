review<00:04:10.600> but<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:11.630> only<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.049> there's<00:04:12.350> much<00:04:12.680> to

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
review but I only think there's much to

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.599 
review but I only think there's much to
say<00:04:13.040> about<00:04:13.160> or<00:04:13.519> puffer<00:04:13.790> Pete<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.980> then<00:04:16.280> I'm<00:04:16.400> a

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
say about or puffer Pete and then I'm a

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.900

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
hold on another thing I like is this

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.190

little<00:04:20.419> slab<00:04:21.260> hanging<00:04:21.919> on<00:04:22.100> his<00:04:22.490> uh<00:04:23.200> buffers
