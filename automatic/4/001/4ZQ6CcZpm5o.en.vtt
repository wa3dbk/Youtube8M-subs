00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.260
 Halli hello and welcome 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.480
 youtube i am right in the children's book 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.160
 welcome to a new video, yes and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.080
 today a little counter strike global 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.720
 offensive and though a few tips and 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.730
 tricks to the eco and how best 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.470
 deal with the hwp and that it is for everyone 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.300
 actually useful is that one 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.160
 knows how to set and correct 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.080
 Although you can here in the settings 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.390
 adjust the mouse sensitivity too 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.010
 very cool because I think 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.840
 then you can just do the best for yourself 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.670
 Hum ratio the best sum 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.320
 adjust sensitivity and so can 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.400
 everyone's personal best 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.380
 Attitudes decide very much 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.270
 interesting but well what is it 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
 new in global affairs the whole 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.989
 I should jump animation then yes 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.059
 This is a bit more insane here 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.820
 coop then mussed that a bit 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.350
 and when I was in Skopje and here 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.509
 the car forward and will blow 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.229
 a little blurry and if I am 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.330
 do not sneak so much cool animation 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.470
 I think that makes the whole thing very elegant 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.060
 a bit more realistic and white 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.600
 I'm not standing right now 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 blurred 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 now I can shoot but as sees 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 that important because what does it look like? 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.970
 with the double cab with the reload 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.690
 animations this bug that he 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.149
 actually one is shooting and by the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.920
 Double cab is quicker 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.590
 close again and how does it look like me 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.479
 shoot we look at each other 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.580
 original loading time is actually but 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.590
 what if I charge now and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.090
 Now I'll do that twice the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.929
 shoot this double cab and shoot 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.910
 shoot again 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.800
 you clearly see that now faster 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.470
 is reloaded as before 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.020
 this animation in la is the animation 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.220
 there is a lot, though 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 more quickly 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.390
 However it's something 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.310
 slower but more practical if the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.780
 people slipped through, I could come 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.740
 for example in fast loskow 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.420
 put if you fast 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.220
 flogged comes and I know 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.780
 simply from there come again new opponents 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 I can aim at that again very much 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.860
 practically how does it look with the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.420
 the price calculation we want 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.000
 I watch the enemy in front of me 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.930
 Just shoot in the chest yes 110 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.360
 in 1 110 in one hit quite simply logical 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.760
 but well, what does it look like when I do that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.730
 foot shot 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 we know that 85 ps can be one 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.360
 be a little less a bit more 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.550
 it was fixed in css times two years ago 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.230
 At that time you really could if 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.000
 one hits the opponent is dead that me 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 not anymore and on the colossus 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 hopefully this is not global 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.950
 More like that and what does it look like when I am 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.600
 the opponent in the head came across how much of the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.220
 human does that the shield is clear 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.110
 but we see he does 441 damage 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.280
 points off he takes the way in one 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 So if I'm nice with ner here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.900
 for example, on all researchers and in 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.890
 I could theoretically add a 5 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.110
 to create in 1 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.989
 very cool are pretty much the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.200
 default values â€‹â€‹but a 5 in 1 by 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.000
 headshots is possible yes we come 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.380
 continue to quick scoping for 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.450
 shoot fast when I am here 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.280
 example on wedig washed come in 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.170
 The katers because then I can fast here 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 Zack zack zack into the cockpit 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.209
 but what about the precise is that 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 weapon of the precise then that is so 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.739
 example as in call of duty no in cs 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.049
 it is not that we see here the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.000
 whole shots are scattered it is 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.940
 not as precise as others 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.110
 play is still cool you can do it 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.400
 maybe I would have animation again 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.480
 maybe they would like that a bit 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.340
 but it is more precise that we want to come 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.080
 against the year here by the double 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.780
 doors and maybe also from distance 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.269
 through the door on the boards but the cool 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.930
 is cisco is a mix of css and 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.190
 cs codes and cs 1.6 and you can too 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.330
 It was here two days ago 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.980
 that you can not get through that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.480
 But the thickest can be decided 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.549
 You can go through it if you go through some 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.280
 shoot world what she thinks cool 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.879
 I like it very much I think so 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.560
 ingenious 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.329
 Cisco is just such an in-between thing 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.230
 between 1.6 and css and when i turn on 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.269
 every case go here 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.879
 I hope I can help you with these tips 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.739
 maybe in public play in versus 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.000
 a bit in shear in the esl 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.799
 I hope I and I could help 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.840
 of course, hope that you always like that 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.270
 liked this video and forget 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 it will benefit us and of course we will 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.410
 do not miss it 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.219
 out
