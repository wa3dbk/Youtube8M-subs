00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560 

and<00:00:00.680> much<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.709> what<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.370> call<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.669> cognition<00:00:03.179> and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
and much of what we call a cognition and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.099 
and much of what we call a cognition and
this<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.990> think<00:00:04.020> really<00:00:04.500> has<00:00:04.799> come<00:00:05.690> to<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> fore

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
this I think really has come to the fore

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.169 
this I think really has come to the fore
as<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> result<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.859> work<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.280> psychology<00:00:09.030> as

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
as a result of work in psychology as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.320 
as a result of work in psychology as
well<00:00:09.420> as<00:00:09.599> neuroscience<00:00:10.440> much<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:12.000> we

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
well as neuroscience much of what we

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.890 
well as neuroscience much of what we
call<00:00:12.540> cognition<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:14.250> skill<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.120> think

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
call cognition is really skill I think

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
call cognition is really skill I think
we<00:00:16.020> went<00:00:16.289> into<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.800> early<00:00:17.130> stages<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
we went into the early stages of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.769 
we went into the early stages of
cognitive<00:00:18.090> science<00:00:18.840> using<00:00:19.439> language<00:00:19.770> as<00:00:20.520> a

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
cognitive science using language as a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.390 
cognitive science using language as a
model<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.810> knowledge<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.650> general<00:00:23.130> we

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
model for knowledge in general we

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.519 
model for knowledge in general we
thought<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.939> knowledge<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.900> being

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
thought of knowledge as being

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.580 
thought of knowledge as being
essentially<00:00:26.160> propositional<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.930> mostly<00:00:28.349> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
essentially propositional but mostly it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.479 
essentially propositional but mostly it
isn't<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.510> mostly<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.869> skill

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
isn't like that mostly it's a skill

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
isn't like that mostly it's a skill

much about this except I suppose we are

carry them out they are all one and all
just<00:01:45.780> constructs<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> brain<00:01:48.079> I'm<00:01:49.079> not

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
just constructs of the brain I'm not

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.569 
just constructs of the brain I'm not
really<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> say<00:01:50.100> very<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.430> about

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
really going to say very much about

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.899 
really going to say very much about
consciousness<00:01:51.479> except<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:53.310> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
consciousness except that I have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.889 
consciousness except that I have
although<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
although I like the the the take on it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.340 
although I like the the the take on it
that<00:01:58.079> Christoph<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> Francis<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.390> for

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that Christoph and and Francis have for

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
that Christoph and and Francis have for
some<00:02:01.560> reason<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.130> guess<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
some reason I guess I'm just kind of a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
some reason I guess I'm just kind of a
stubborn<00:02:03.899> person<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.950> kind<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> look<00:02:05.369> at

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
stubborn person I just kind of look at

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
stubborn person I just kind of look at
it<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.939> slightly<00:02:06.180> different<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:09.170> okay<00:02:10.170> am<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it in a slightly different way okay am I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.120 
it in a slightly different way okay am I
pressing<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> button<00:02:11.550> or

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
pressing the button or

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.150 
pressing the button or
so<00:02:12.400> I'm<00:02:12.490> pressing<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> button<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:15.070> we

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
so I'm pressing the button but there we

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.320 
so I'm pressing the button but there we
go<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.380> came<00:02:17.680> up<00:02:17.710> earlier<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.760> morning

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
go and this came up earlier this morning

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.400 
go and this came up earlier this morning
and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.410> think<00:02:20.830> Sydney<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.460> ours<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:22.630> least

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and I I think Sydney and ours it least

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.510 
and I I think Sydney and ours it least
in<00:02:23.620> some<00:02:23.890> degree<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.810> agreement<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.400> tend<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
in some degree of agreement I tend to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.460 
in some degree of agreement I tend to
think<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.600> problem<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:29.140> consciousness

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
think that the problem of consciousness

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.020 
think that the problem of consciousness
is<00:02:30.310> really<00:02:31.240> analogous<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.410> problem<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
is really analogous to the problem that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.340 
is really analogous to the problem that
people<00:02:34.180> face<00:02:34.540> at<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> turn<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> century

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
people face at the turn of the century

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.970 
people face at the turn of the century
but<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.340> life<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.710> know<00:02:38.830> of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
but what is life and as you know of

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.410 
but what is life and as you know of
course<00:02:39.160> some<00:02:39.370> people<00:02:39.430> thought<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:39.970> there

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
course some people thought that there

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.080 
course some people thought that there
that<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.200> answer<00:02:41.770> what's<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.730> difference

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that the answer what's the difference

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
that the answer what's the difference
between<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.510> dead<00:02:43.780> thing<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.500> live<00:02:44.740> thing

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
between a dead thing and a live thing

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.330 
between a dead thing and a live thing
that<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.550> answer<00:02:45.970> could<00:02:46.150> only<00:02:46.360> be<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.530> long

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that the answer could only be a long

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
that the answer could only be a long
vcal<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.270> there<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.570> some<00:02:49.810> sort<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.110> vital

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
vcal that there is some sort of vital

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.100 
vcal that there is some sort of vital
spirit<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.310> perhaps<00:02:52.000> some<00:02:52.390> people<00:02:52.810> looked

spirit and perhaps some people looked
for<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:55.000> vital<00:02:55.390> coral<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.930> sea<00:02:56.110> might<00:02:56.320> say<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
for the vital coral and sea might say of

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.320 
for the vital coral and sea might say of
living<00:02:58.990> pneus<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.190> don't<00:03:00.460> think<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.940> vital

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
living pneus and I don't think the vital

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.990 
living pneus and I don't think the vital
correlates<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.020> living<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.670> strategy<00:03:03.670> with

all due respect I don't think that was

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.730 
all due respect I don't think that was
the<00:03:05.980> strategy<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.850> taught<00:03:07.360> us<00:03:07.630> about<00:03:07.870> what

huge amount of work from cell biology

it's<00:03:38.710> just<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.340> question<00:03:40.000> doesn't<00:03:40.180> get

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
it's just that question doesn't get

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
that consciousness is a bit like that

that consciousness is a bit like that

the disin ala g is with something like

what is fermentation where there was a

what is fermentation where there was a

the question about consciousness is like

the question about consciousness is like

that there isn't if my opinion likely to

that there isn't if my opinion likely to

be a single answer and although I think

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.100 
be a single answer and although I think
in<00:04:21.460> some<00:04:21.489> ways<00:04:21.700> Christoph<00:04:22.210> probably<00:04:22.810> agrees

with me because we both agree
you<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.860> can<00:04:27.040> start<00:04:27.400> with<00:04:27.670> what<00:04:27.910> it's

you that you can start with what it's

that there are a range of phenomena

that there are a range of phenomena

we're<00:05:04.060> aware<00:05:04.420> of<00:05:04.720> ourselves<00:05:05.320> as<00:05:05.830> agents

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.430 
we're aware of ourselves as agents
partly<00:05:07.330> because<00:05:07.480> we<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:07.990> efforts<00:05:08.380> copy<00:05:10.440> so

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
partly because we have efforts copy so

partly because we have efforts copy so
the<00:05:11.560> indirect<00:05:12.310> approach<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.210> we<00:05:13.360> need<00:05:13.540> to

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
the indirect approach is that we need to

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.330 
the indirect approach is that we need to
really<00:05:14.020> understand<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.710> whole<00:05:14.890> lot<00:05:15.130> of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
really understand a whole lot of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.800 
really understand a whole lot of
functions<00:05:16.470> some<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.620> which<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:18.010> list<00:05:18.250> here<00:05:18.810> but

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
functions some of which I list here but

functions some of which I list here but
in<00:05:19.960> addition<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:22.030> is<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.330> part<00:05:22.570> of

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
decades because we really do see all

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.850 
decades because we really do see all
kinds<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.700> places<00:05:42.990> where<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.169> traditional

ushered into the neural biological

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.570 
ushered into the neural biological
laboratories<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.919> that's<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.310> wonderful

laboratories and that's a wonderful

laboratories and that's a wonderful
thing<00:05:52.290> but<00:05:53.290> I<00:05:53.350> also<00:05:53.650> want<00:05:54.160> to<00:05:54.250> emphasize<00:05:54.460> and

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
thing but I also want to emphasize and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.880 
thing but I also want to emphasize and
this<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.450> something<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:55.870> also<00:05:56.230> came<00:05:56.680> out

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
this is something that also came out

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.100 
this is something that also came out
this<00:05:57.040> morning<00:05:57.310> that<00:05:58.090> there<00:05:58.330> are<00:05:58.480> major<00:05:58.810> issues

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
this morning that there are major issues

within<00:06:02.919> neuroscience<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:05.080> i'll<00:06:05.800> try<00:06:06.040> and

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
within neuroscience and i'll try and

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.390 
within neuroscience and i'll try and
quickly<00:06:06.520> go<00:06:06.700> through<00:06:06.730> these<00:06:07.180> without<00:06:08.400> pausing

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
quickly go through these without pausing

we<00:06:40.040> saw<00:06:40.250> this<00:06:40.490> morning<00:06:45.340> we<00:06:46.340> see<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:47.660> brain<00:06:47.870> the

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
we saw this morning we see the brain the

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.740 
we saw this morning we see the brain the
visual<00:06:48.530> system<00:06:48.710> represents<00:06:49.639> a<00:06:49.790> line<00:06:50.180> of<00:06:50.540> the

visual system represents a line of the
triangle<00:06:51.530> it<00:06:51.800> isn't<00:06:52.430> there<00:06:52.990> so<00:06:53.990> there<00:06:54.169> is

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
triangle it isn't there so there is

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.850 
triangle it isn't there so there is
nothing<00:06:54.710> in<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:55.669> stimulus<00:06:56.360> tell<00:06:57.260> rich<00:06:57.560> that

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
nothing in the stimulus tell rich that

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.180 
nothing in the stimulus tell rich that
line<00:06:58.160> corresponds<00:06:59.889> similarly<00:07:00.889> in<00:07:01.010> the<00:07:01.160> case

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
line corresponds similarly in the case

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.360 
line corresponds similarly in the case
of<00:07:01.430> so-called<00:07:02.350> subjective<00:07:03.350> motion<00:07:03.860> where<00:07:04.340> a

light goes off here and comes off here

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.480 
light goes off here and comes off here
and<00:07:06.740> you<00:07:07.190> see<00:07:07.520> a<00:07:08.090> line<00:07:08.900> movie<00:07:09.340> there<00:07:10.340> is

and you see a line movie there is

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.320 
and you see a line movie there is
nothing<00:07:10.820> in<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.540> stimulus<00:07:12.139> to<00:07:12.530> which<00:07:13.330> the
