00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
nourishing but they still give you a

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.670 
nourishing but they still give you a
real<00:02:08.410> blast<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.489> color<00:02:09.729> which<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.719> like<00:02:10.959> six

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.120 
is a really pretty kind of berry shade
but<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.700> bearing<00:02:28.390> more<00:02:28.810> towards<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.590> pink

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
but it's bearing more towards the pink

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.070 
but it's bearing more towards the pink
side<00:02:30.400> than<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:32.110> red<00:02:32.770> side<00:02:33.100> also<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:34.540> coral

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
kind of coral shade but again I'd say

call<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.050> tip<00:04:03.480> what<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.200> don't<00:04:05.500> know

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
call it a tip what is it I don't know

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.520 
call it a tip what is it I don't know
but<00:04:06.040> can<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.580> see<00:04:06.850> if<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.360> really<00:04:07.630> flat<00:04:08.260> at

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
but can you see if I just really flat at

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.930 
but can you see if I just really flat at
the<00:04:08.680> end<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.250> don't<00:04:09.280> think<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.790> that

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the end and I don't think that that

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.620 
the end and I don't think that that
makes<00:04:10.300> for<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> really<00:04:11.170> easy<00:04:11.620> application<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.730> am

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
makes for a really easy application I am

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.780 
makes for a really easy application I am
gonna<00:04:13.810> try<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.200> round<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.740> out<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.490> it's<00:04:15.640> like

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
gonna try and round it out so it's like

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.430 
gonna try and round it out so it's like
a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.310 
a
you<00:04:17.130> know<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.400> an<00:04:17.610> usual<00:04:18.000> lipstick<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.080> like

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you know like an usual lipstick is like

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.830 
you know like an usual lipstick is like
either<00:04:19.950> pointy<00:04:20.580> or<00:04:20.850> round<00:04:21.120> at<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.360> end<00:04:21.570> it's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
either pointy or round at the end it's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.680 
either pointy or round at the end it's
my<00:04:21.959> ambition<00:04:22.080> in<00:04:22.740> life<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.910> make<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.390> round

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
my ambition in life to make this round

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.050 
my ambition in life to make this round
at<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> end<00:04:25.200> because<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.950> think<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:26.820> give

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
at the end because I think it will give

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.700 
at the end because I think it will give
me<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> much<00:04:27.420> easier<00:04:27.750> application<00:04:28.560> because

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
me a much easier application because

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.220 
me a much easier application because
it's<00:04:28.860> kind<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.100> difficult<00:04:29.340> like<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:31.080> find

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
it's kind of difficult like I just find

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.510 
it's kind of difficult like I just find
it<00:04:31.350> difficult<00:04:31.380> especially<00:04:32.220> when<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.400> get

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
it difficult especially when you get

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.780 
it difficult especially when you get
into<00:04:32.700> like<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.000> thinner<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.930> outer<00:04:34.740> area<00:04:35.700> of

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
into like the thinner and outer area of

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.670 
into like the thinner and outer area of
your<00:04:35.970> lips<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.600> really<00:04:37.080> really<00:04:37.320> like<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
your lips it really really like the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.840 
your lips it really really like the
packaging<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.400> think<00:04:38.580> they<00:04:38.700> all<00:04:38.820> look

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
packaging and I think they all look

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.070 
packaging and I think they all look
really<00:04:39.030> really<00:04:39.540> pretty

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
really really pretty

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.890 
really really pretty
now<00:04:40.410> these<00:04:40.800> cost<00:04:41.310> 8<00:04:41.610> pounds<00:04:42.060> each<00:04:42.180> which<00:04:42.540> I

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
now these cost 8 pounds each which I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.100 
now these cost 8 pounds each which I
know<00:04:43.350> for<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> lip<00:04:43.950> balm<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.640> more<00:04:45.240> towards

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
know for a lip balm that is more towards

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.160 
know for a lip balm that is more towards
the<00:04:46.320> higher<00:04:46.620> end<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.580> scale<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.140> I

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
the higher end of the scale but I

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.810 
the higher end of the scale but I
definitely<00:04:49.410> think<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.890> these<00:04:50.100> are<00:04:50.310> worth<00:04:50.490> it

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
definitely think that these are worth it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.240 
definitely think that these are worth it
because<00:04:51.350> they're<00:04:52.350> obviously<00:04:52.740> going<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.040> last

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
because they're obviously going to last

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.230 
because they're obviously going to last
you<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.520> ages

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.770 
you for ages
and<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:56.250> think<00:04:56.430> they<00:04:56.730> really<00:04:57.240> do<00:04:57.450> make

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
and I just think they really do make

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.290 
and I just think they really do make
your<00:04:58.080> lips<00:04:58.320> feel<00:04:58.500> super<00:04:59.370> moisturized<00:04:59.940> and

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
are all quite different although natural

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.940 
are all quite different although natural

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
rose and honey necks are coming off

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.310 
rose and honey necks are coming off
looking<00:06:37.280> quite<00:06:37.550> similar<00:06:38.150> I<00:06:38.360> can<00:06:38.840> assure<00:06:38.960> you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
you what the kind of stain looked like

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.050 
you what the kind of stain looked like
that<00:06:45.770> was<00:06:45.890> left<00:06:46.130> on<00:06:46.310> your<00:06:46.460> lips

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
that was left on your lips

I saved the coral crush swatch til last

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.270 
I saved the coral crush swatch til last
because<00:06:50.810> it<00:06:50.900> was<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.170> brightest<00:06:51.710> shade<00:06:51.950> off

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
because it was the brightest shade off

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.610

them<00:06:52.610> all<00:06:52.730> and<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.870> just<00:06:54.050> wanted<00:06:54.260> to<00:06:54.410> show<00:06:54.590> you

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
that you do you are left with a tiny bit

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.770 
that you do you are left with a tiny bit
of<00:06:57.350> color<00:06:57.620> to<00:06:57.920> your<00:06:57.950> lips<00:06:58.280> and<00:06:58.670> I<00:06:59.360> know<00:06:59.450> that<00:06:59.720> I

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780

of color to your lips and I know that I
have<00:07:00.080> successively<00:07:00.980> swatched<00:07:01.460> all<00:07:01.820> four

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
have successively swatched all four

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.780 
have successively swatched all four
shades<00:07:02.600> so<00:07:03.140> it<00:07:03.710> would<00:07:03.860> be<00:07:04.040> crazy<00:07:04.280> to<00:07:04.610> imagine

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
shades so it would be crazy to imagine

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.340 
shades so it would be crazy to imagine
that<00:07:05.150> there<00:07:05.300> wouldn't<00:07:05.510> be<00:07:05.570> any<00:07:05.660> color<00:07:06.050> on<00:07:06.230> my

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
that there wouldn't be any color on my

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.850 
that there wouldn't be any color on my
lips<00:07:06.560> whatsoever<00:07:07.130> I<00:07:07.400> suppose
