00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
underneath when you able to see go I had

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.230 
underneath when you able to see go I had
to<00:00:56.060> cut<00:00:56.270> this<00:00:56.390> one<00:00:56.570> off<00:00:57.280> because<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.880> can't<00:00:59.150> get

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
to cut this one off because I can't get

it before I put in the heat shield work
under<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.610> carpet<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.500> basically

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
under the carpet but this is basically

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.360 
under the carpet but this is basically

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
know I'm about to finish cleaning it up

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.880 
know I'm about to finish cleaning it up
and<00:01:42.439> spray<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.890> out<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.289> thought<00:01:45.500> everybody

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and spray it out and I thought everybody

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.310 
and spray it out and I thought everybody
could<00:01:45.920> want<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.310> see<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:47.600> cutout<00:01:47.929> here

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
could want to see this this cutout here

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.639 
could want to see this this cutout here
I<00:01:48.380> believe<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:49.100> Factory<00:01:50.079> I'm<00:01:51.079> not<00:01:51.409> sure

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
I believe is Factory I'm not sure

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.590 
I believe is Factory I'm not sure
because<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.850> only<00:01:53.000> Corvette<00:01:53.450> I've

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
because this is only Corvette I've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.419 
because this is only Corvette I've
stripped<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.200> whole<00:01:54.350> interior<00:01:54.560> ATO<00:01:54.859> so<00:01:55.369> I

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
stripped the whole interior ATO so I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.449 
stripped the whole interior ATO so I
wasn't<00:01:56.119> sure<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.110> looks<00:01:57.319> factory<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.039> me<00:01:58.189> I

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
wasn't sure but it looks factory to me I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.870 
wasn't sure but it looks factory to me I
think<00:01:59.000> because<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> first<00:02:00.890> year<00:02:01.159> being<00:02:01.369> with

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
think because the first year being with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.120 
think because the first year being with
a<00:02:01.909> catalytic<00:02:02.329> converter<00:02:02.679> this<00:02:03.679> might<00:02:04.009> have

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
a catalytic converter this might have

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.819 
a catalytic converter this might have
been<00:02:04.159> there<00:02:04.459> as<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.850> each<00:02:05.119> yield<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.770> don't<00:02:06.770> know

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
been there as a each yield I don't know

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.410 
been there as a each yield I don't know
if<00:02:06.890> I'm<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.159> sort<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.670> melted<00:02:08.000> or<00:02:08.119> something

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
if I'm that sort of melted or something

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.850 
if I'm that sort of melted or something
I<00:02:08.539> don't<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> clue<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.440> think<00:02:09.679> that's

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
I don't have a clue but I think that's

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.089 
I don't have a clue but I think that's
factory<00:02:10.930> but<00:02:11.930> there<00:02:12.079> any<00:02:12.200> Corvette<00:02:12.680> experts

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
factory but there any Corvette experts

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.220 
factory but there any Corvette experts
out<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.790> if<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:14.840> or<00:02:15.049> it's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
out there that know if this is or it's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.050 
out there that know if this is or it's
not<00:02:15.470> Factory<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.160> would<00:02:16.430> love<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:16.670> hear<00:02:16.790> from

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:45.200 

we<00:02:36.540> control<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.460> most<00:02:38.460> allowed<00:02:44.210> wiring

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
we control the most allowed wiring

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.700 
we control the most allowed wiring
harness<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.660> runs<00:02:45.750> across<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.320> back<00:02:46.470> of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this plane the seats that actually just

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.530 
this plane the seats that actually just
exciting<00:02:48.420> frontier<00:02:48.840> closed<00:02:49.080> crossed<00:02:53.540> but

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
exciting frontier closed crossed but

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.210 
exciting frontier closed crossed but
anyways<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.230> pretty<00:02:55.590> much<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.010> once

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
anyways that's pretty much it once

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.790 
anyways that's pretty much it once
you've<00:02:56.370> stripped<00:02:56.610> everything<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:57.620> place<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you've stripped everything out place the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000 
you've stripped everything out place the
four<00:02:59.010> holes<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.550> then<00:02:59.640> you've<00:02:59.760> got<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:01.010> hole

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
four holes and then you've got a hole

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.290 
four holes and then you've got a hole
here<00:03:03.140> for<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.550> plastic<00:03:05.550> cover<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> said

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
here for this plastic cover like I said

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.710 
here for this plastic cover like I said
