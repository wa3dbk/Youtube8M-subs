 make your business for this year competes easier than you 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.109
 imagine the first step is to learn how it works 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.109
 when you use the gogó inserts a search query by a word 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.429
 quickly forwarded to a results page of this query 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.769
 on the left side of this page are the natural search results that are 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.839
 presented and ordered on the basis of the complex and 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.560
 which is based on the level of relevance of the websites associated with your 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.340
 research can not directly influence these results 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.170
 however there are also blocks of text in which the content can actually 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.940
 to influence 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.040
 these are the sponsored links that appear on the right side of the 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.310
 results and in some cases noted a 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.440
 when a google user did a search related to your business 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.270
 you can ensure that a link to your site appears with the results 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.379
 of this research 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.610
 and you can choose when and where your ad should appear 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 starting to advertise is much easier than you think. 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.840
 potential customers you'd like your ad to come 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.040
 I chose their language and also their location by country that would be 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.350
 the same city if for example if the business is located in diadema 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 you can choose to show your ad only to people in the big 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.710
 Paulo 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.159
 on the other hand if your business is not associated with any 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.659
 specific location your ad may appear throughout the country or 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.560
 even in the selection of countries of your choice then write an announcement 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.590
 presenting your business 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.600
 the ad structure consists of a title followed by two lines 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.430
 descriptive information that their products or 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.510
 and ends with the address of your website 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.790
 then choose terms that when entered into the google search field 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.060
 should stir the advertisers' presentation 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 these terms are called keywords you should choose those that 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.689
 customers to use while looking for something 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.959
 type of service or product your company provides 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.620
 if it is a flower shop for example you can start your list of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.909
 keywords like flower delivery the more precise your flowers are 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.959
 keywords are more likely to impact people who are looking for 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.839
 exactly what your company offers 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.589
 finally chose the maximum that is willing to pay for a crime that in his 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.879
 that total wedding you want to spend per day 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.719
 one of the main aspects of the market anticipates that when someone searches for a 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.900
 of the keywords you have chosen and your ad appears on google is not 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.959
 no cost 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.270
 only happens when the user clicks the link to your website 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.300
 this way you have complete control of all the financial aspects of your 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.880
 campaign the position of the sponsored link in the list is partially determined 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.779
 for the amount you have decided to pay for each customer 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.479
 however it is also determined by the relevance of your ad in relation 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.629
 the search 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.709
 so the more you targeted your ad in your keyword list 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.879
 - money will have to be invested to ensure the presentation of your 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.560
 advertisement 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.099
