00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.910
 hello I am star ramÃ³n of the team 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.719
 star mouse perez very happy of 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.580
 be right now here to mention to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.160
 one way a kind of trick to 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.110
 register an original when you do not have 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.880
 time drag 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.040
 the trick is not a child I already explained 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 everything he did and what he knew 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.750
 respect in a previous video you have the 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.360
 link here and also I leave it in 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.700
 the description for those who do not 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.250
 we connect from a computer and then 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.210
 you can not access the annotations of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.730
 video 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.010
 the trick is this alternating a 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.920
 illustrator who sent me an email from 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.080
 Berlin where to be and that takes more than 20 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.300
 years illustrating apparently the trick is 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.890
 old and it's pretty popular among 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 illustrators I had never heard it and it 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.930
 would have happened surely either 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.600
 but it's so good that he answers his 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.449
 email and I asked for permission to share it 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.119
 with you he said yes so he is 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.840
 internally thank you very much the trick 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.030
 consists of taking an envelope 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.050
 and put all the material that you would have 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 that get to register inside 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the envelope you write your own name 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.480
 own postal address and the means that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.430
 the name of the project would be very clear 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.980
 what have you gotten inside 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.920
 to secure the closure with a strip of 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.430
 zeal and you send it quietly to you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 same when the man comes back to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.030
 your house is postmarked and the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.760
 postmark works as official date 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.300
 in case of plagiarism of litigation you can 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.150
 present this closed envelope and what 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.310
 make the relevant judge and see that 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.740
 it really is true according to the date of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.640
 postmark you already owned this from that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 material at that time you see 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.310
 it seemed a trick of the movie 's 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.009
 black and white but the case is that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.130
 it works with what it's worth 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.230
 take it into account and here the video 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.330
 today I hope you find it useful many 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.560
 thanks bolt hernando and up to the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.560
 next video we'll see you
