what model earphones these are and but

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.920 
what model earphones these are and but
I'll<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> look<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.360> put<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> video

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
I'll have a look and put it in the video

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.270 
I'll have a look and put it in the video
and<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:58.490> looks<00:02:58.520> like<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.060> get<00:02:59.240> some<00:02:59.540> spare

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.990 
and it looks like you get some spare
earbuds<00:03:01.280> as<00:03:01.520> well

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
earbuds as well

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.810 
earbuds as well
in<00:03:02.420> case<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.080> clip<00:03:03.470> that's<00:03:04.340> really<00:03:04.610> handy

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
in case on a clip that's really handy

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.300 
in case on a clip that's really handy
and<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:06.020> guess<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.590> case<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.980> other<00:03:07.100> ones

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
and I guess just in case the other ones

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.480 
and I guess just in case the other ones
are<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.490> bit<00:03:07.550> uncomfortable<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.860> get<00:03:10.220> a

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
slipped out of my hands there that's one

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.300 
slipped out of my hands there that's one
thing<00:03:59.990> about<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.380> phone<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:00.950> actually

thing about this phone it's actually

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.080 
thing about this phone it's actually
quite<00:04:01.580> tin<00:04:01.940> its<00:04:02.210> tin<00:04:02.480> enough<00:04:02.720> anyway<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.090> on

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
quite tin its tin enough anyway and on

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.740 
quite tin its tin enough anyway and on
it<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.450> fits<00:04:05.660> nicely<00:04:05.990> into<00:04:06.440> my<00:04:06.590> hands<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:07.820> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
only thing is I think the rounded edges

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.940 
only thing is I think the rounded edges
just<00:04:11.060> kind<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.450> make<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.960> little<00:04:12.260> bit<00:04:12.530> slippy

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
just kind of make it a little bit slippy

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.550 
just kind of make it a little bit slippy
it's<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.510> much<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.930> big<00:04:15.140> deal<00:04:15.170> I

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
it's not that much of a big deal I

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.990 
it's not that much of a big deal I
