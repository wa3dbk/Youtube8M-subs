00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.160
We’re in Tensator’s offices
in Lisbon, Portugal

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.880
launching the Fingernails 2 Go nail art kiosk.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.440
The kiosk was brought about through the demand
of the beauty and cosmetic industry for nail art

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.000
which has boomed
and exceeded lipstick sales

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.280
and every other type of
cosmetics in the industry.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.400
The Fingernails 2 Go kiosk provides
nail art within two seconds of printing.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.680
The range of designs can be thousands
upon thousands on the nail art kiosk.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.040
You can also bring your own USB and
download a picture to put onto your nails.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.080
The challenge was finding a partner
to work in conjunction with

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.600
to build a kiosk,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.480
a printer which would print to the exact
shape of the fingernail within seconds.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.720
Time was always of the
essence in the printing.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.680
So, in conjunction
with Tensator and HP,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.760
we are now able to produce
this nail art within seconds.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.960
One of our main challenges that
we had to overcome was the ink.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.280
The ink needed to comply
with regulations across the globe.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.000
Normal ink and normal cartridges
wouldn’t have complied with the regulations.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.120
With Tritron we’ve managed
to produce a formula of ink

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.920
that complies with every regulation; European,
FDA and suits every country in the globe.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.960
We are doing all kinds of inkjet inks
for all kinds of different technologies.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.840
In particular we are doing inkjet inks
for thermal inkjet HP technology. 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.520
We were called by HP

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.920
and they asked us if we would be capable of
developing a special inkjet ink set for nail printing.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.120
Since we are used to doing food grading,
we felt very comfortable to do that.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.520
It has been a very interesting
project I have to say.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.040
The main challenge for printing
on nails is the regulations;

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.720
the different regulations of the cosmetic
industry all around the globe.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.200
Tensator is a global solution provider
for the customer journey across all sectors

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.960
providing solutions for appointment
booking systems, queue management,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.120
delivering efficiency, profitability
and revenue for all of our clients.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.040
We use HP thermal inkjet
technology in a number of ways.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.160
Mostly we use it for our
multi-service machines

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.440
where we have an application for self service
where we want to print out a coupon

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.560
or a booking confirmation
for an appointment.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.000
So, a really good example of our application of
HP TIJ Technology is in our Fingernails 2 Go machine.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.160
Working closely with HP for this
particular project has been very interesting.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.240
We’ve had to work together as a team
and involve different stakeholders

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.600
from various parts of the HP and Tensator
business to really move this innovation along.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.000
It’s taken great creativity from the team,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.080
sometimes a lot of faith,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.920
but we’ve all worked together very well.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.760
We are very excited about
this innovative product

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.200
that allows the user to come and have their
fingernails painted using HP TIJ 4.0 technology.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.640
We have worked very closely with HP to deliver
what is a very unique and exciting proposition.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.520
I think it’s never been done before.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320
So, we are all very excited
about this new application.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.200
The Fingernails 2 Go kiosk can print
natural nails or artificial nails.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.160
It’s a very simple process.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.480
We have a kit for
both types of printing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
In the natural nail pack you get
a BS code, you get a base coat 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.520
and then we print your nail
and put the top coat on.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080
In the artificial kit,
you get two sets of these

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.760
and you just simply put
them into the machine

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.520
and they print directly
onto them in two seconds.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.800
You then top coat them and dry them.
It lasts up to ten days.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.040
The kiosk is very simple to use.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.200
Pick an image.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.800
Add it to your selection.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.920
Hit “next”.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.920
Are you ready to go?
Yes, let’s go.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.320
Because we're using natural nails, we should pick 'Natural Nail Pack'.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.800
The carriage comes out to draw your finger in

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.440
and we hit "next step"

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.040
Hit print.
