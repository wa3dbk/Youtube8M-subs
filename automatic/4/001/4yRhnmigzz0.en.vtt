00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.450
 the first thing we'll do 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 will be there go well these little ones come 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.640
 all in blue is the inverse effect of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.480
 package we have to wash well 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 them before putting to boil 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 they are like that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.790
 and these can be eaten at will 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.480
 from the clear attack phase not with 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.220
 This sauce I'm going to do but adapt 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.230
 so you can eat does not make 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.620
 of attack it is from the phase of 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.620
 attack 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.209
 then rinse well I'll leave them 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.920
 I'll run here a little bit and I'll see if the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.959
 water is already boiling 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.560
 after washing the Iraqi well 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.159
 I put it in boiling water to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.159
 boil a little 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 While it will allow for an attack, I will do the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 sauce in this frying pan I'll go 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.320
 put a little water 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.950
 I say you have your side this way 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.950
 olive oil 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:56.790
 [Music] 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 the chili 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.539
 [Applause] 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.460
 and now the flesh 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.970
 I'm using ground beef 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.120
 but you can use the output of cattle 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.120
 at 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.530
 when it starts to change in the background you 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.920
 put a little water can help 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.920
 and help 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.280
 [Applause] 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 now I'm going to put salt 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 I will also put some blood 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.090
 hydrated and now we have already 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.650
 wink in the flesh has already put a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.080
 little water to finish 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.620
 cooking has begun to change at the end of 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.010
 a little more water and the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.010
 to take 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.919
 and now on low heat let's leave 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.610
 cook for about ten minutes this 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.439
 name so now i chose this attack 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.999
 I let it cook for the 10 minutes. 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.579
 more or less 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:30.999
 in fact it does not have a time a time 

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:33.219
 Exactly does not mark anything in the package and 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.719
 also in it changes texture I think 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.939
 have to cook a little just to take 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.949
 the strong taste do not know what or idea is 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.799
 the first time I'm doing it and a 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.120
 sauce has been cooking for another ten 

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:49.420
 minutes too and now I'm going to put 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.420
