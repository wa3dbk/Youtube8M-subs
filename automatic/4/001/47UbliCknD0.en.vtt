00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.170
 In this video, let's talk about exchange rates 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 Yandex direct it is important to understand that before 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 all courses all bets all prices were 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 only ye in conventional units 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 and later currencies were introduced 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.260
 national that is Ukraine this hryvnia 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.010
 In Russia, it is the ruble in the register 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.869
 respectively, their currencies therefore 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 every currency every every rich and ryan 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.830
 and take and brought in conventional units 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.789
 it used to be dollars but now it is not 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 just a dollar and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.250
 what is cu let's look we 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 we will understand first came Yandex began 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.469
 look for exchange rates yandex direct 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 nothing really found in 1 issue and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 went to google and the first bitch me 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.620
 led by request exchange rates Yandex 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.969
 direct led to the course sign this 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.870
 small lyrical digression about 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.750
 as searching for Yandex; as searching for google 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 Okay, this is such a reference to this 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.059
 the page will be under the video and that we are here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.439
 see that 1st at the moment and 30 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 rubles it is only lower the dollar it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.439
 12 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.049
 hryvnia and so on 5 euro what is it 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.090
 means it means that basically everything 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.210
 all your bills all your money 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.159
 provided Kue and after that these have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 there is work inside the base itself 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.959
 Yandex ie the director of the fat is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.899
 same your cost but proceeding from ye 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.689
 there is also a tablet with minimal 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.929
 rates as we see yes here in hryvnia 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.299
 minimum bet of 8 kopecks or 900 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.079
 hryvnia logical in rubles minimum 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 the rate is 30 kopecks or several thousand 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.539
 rubles , in principle, everything can be seen here 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.140
 look ask this figure 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:59.579
 have a look further need to pay 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.899
 attention to mts what is the vat and with what 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.429
 eat it is a surcharge tax 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:09.060
 the cost that the index takes you 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:14.069
 you are running an account before was an account 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.739
 there were accounts cu vat did not get a 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.350
 now when executing the index takes 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.600
 rounded mass percent of hryvnia 20 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.799
 percent it looks like this 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.840
 we see our company initially we 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.630
 here we see a button to connect the general 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.940
 account we press it we connect the general account 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 in order not to replenish each 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.989
 company separately and after that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.180
 replenish the account this will appear darling 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.030
 pay extra we click and see that we 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 perform an account for 800 hryvnia while 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.769
 payment will be 960 TDS appears so 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 Image index a little from the start 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.359
 leaves without a 200 percent budget here 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.000
 there are people who specifically 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.040
 recalculated 9-ki calculator and think in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.739
 the better to campaign in rubles 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.109
 hryvnia something there in dollars in general 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.799
 try to twist-twirl to trick 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:14.669
 Yandex direct but personally I am not a supporter 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.410
 such manipulations advice to be hard 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.680
 it will take time constantly courses 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.950
 grow especially now in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 a dollar in rubles long 30-33 date you 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.799
 almost 50 hryvnia rose personally that is 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.900
 background growth rates is very difficult to monitor 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.180
 all this and jump from account to 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.359
 account to cut that ruble account 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.609
 100 yeah account that the game is not warriors 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.420
 will be very uncomfortable and you will be 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.329
 uncomfortable at least 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.659
 situation of exchange rates yes and in principle 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.519
 it's pretty simple the essence of the lesson in 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.340
 that there are different courses from different 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.560
 they will need to understand that to leave is not 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.889
 always dollars yes they are translated by 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.540
 the course itself is recalculated into your 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.030
 currency and 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.769
 considering CPC and cost response to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.290
 remember about the VAT here if in Ukraine 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.859
 taking out of us for a click is 8 kopeks then 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.519
 these 8 kopecks need to be multiplied by 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:17.630
 there we will turn ds and will be approximately 9 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.759
 9 and 6 pennies for the clip next lesson we 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.169
 let's talk about ghost finances 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.820
 ad campaigns and see you on 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.560
 clothing aki actually watch out for 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.510
 updates come in contact 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.510
