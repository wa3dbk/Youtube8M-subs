 This is my skin, my corner is that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.280
 instead of skin and I made him in that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.020
 The program that I'll pass on to you is fine. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.530
 simple on your website that was talking 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.120
 for you I feel here I already started 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.199
 to do but how we will 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 to use this is this tutorial in case 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.180
 I already started doing his hair here. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.480
 Mohican 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.609
 normally it comes as the same xiv and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.799
 You start messing with him. 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.650
 for example up here will have this the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.049
 parts of the body and if from above 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.720
 he means that the hat is then 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.290
 You are to edit here and it will appear 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.689
 this screen that will be his hat 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 so you can not edit 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.549
 directly you click to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.640
 take to get the face directly 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.479
 here the tools are very simple and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 if here I chose agreement or the color of the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.220
 of the face nor the small brush so a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.990
 time to copy 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 click the one you wanted was the color of the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.250
 face that's already here so I can 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.120
 explain with the hand drag and 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.160
 and doing I'll end up here when 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.340
