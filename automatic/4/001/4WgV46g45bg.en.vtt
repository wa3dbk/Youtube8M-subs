00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
I'm probably sure doing videos on the

I'm probably sure doing videos on the
actual<00:00:16.199> game<00:00:16.320> itself<00:00:16.550> as<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> right<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:17.910> it's

not<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.330> far<00:00:18.660> into<00:00:18.779> development<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.289> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
not that far into development so it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.080 
not that far into development so it's
pretty<00:00:19.529> fun<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.460> pretty<00:00:20.580> good<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.000> an

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pretty fun but it's pretty good for an

pretty fun but it's pretty good for an
in-game<00:00:21.359> browser<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> video<00:00:22.350> of

how to set up a server for world wide

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
how to set up a server for world wide
instead<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> land<00:00:26.340> server<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
instead of just the land server like you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
instead of just the land server like you
can<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.840> internet<00:00:28.170> connection<00:00:28.560> now

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
can do like on internet connection now

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.529 
can do like on internet connection now
if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> don't<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.400> where<00:00:29.550> land<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.510> uh

if you don't know where land is it uh
it's<00:00:31.140> land<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.340> much<00:00:32.520> something<00:00:32.730> where

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's land is pretty much something where

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's land is pretty much something where
everyone<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.290> being<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.860> wireless

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
everyone has being the same wireless

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
everyone has being the same wireless
router<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.450> network<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.440> play<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:38.040> each

router or network to play with each

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
router or network to play with each
other<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the same household to do that now this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
the same household to do that now this
is<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> way<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> bypass<00:00:41.489> didn't<00:00:42.000> make<00:00:42.090> er<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
is a way to bypass didn't make er you

is a way to bypass didn't make er you
can<00:00:42.270> play<00:00:42.510> online<00:00:42.719> um<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.980> yeah<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.129> gonna

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
can play online um so yeah I'm gonna

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
can play online um so yeah I'm gonna
show<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.600> easy

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
show you how to do it it's pretty easy

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
show you how to do it it's pretty easy
and<00:00:46.320> straightforward<00:00:46.399> there's<00:00:47.399> some<00:00:47.520> ways

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and straightforward there's some ways

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
and straightforward there's some ways
but<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> static<00:00:48.390> IP<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> stuff

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
but you have to do a static IP and stuff

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.240 
but you have to do a static IP and stuff
like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
like that and this is not that one of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
like that and this is not that one of
those<00:00:50.309> ways<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> pretty<00:00:51.930> much<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
those ways this is pretty much how you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.049 
those ways this is pretty much how you
do<00:00:52.469> any<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.739> server<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:53.879> much

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
do any other server so I'm pretty much

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
do any other server so I'm pretty much
gonna<00:00:54.210> walk<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> through<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> first

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410

whatever<00:01:23.040> users<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.549> how<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> find

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
whatever users I don't know how to find

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
whatever users I don't know how to find
it<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.119> Mac<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> should<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it for Mac but this should be how it is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
it for Mac but this should be how it is
and<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> should<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> something<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and it should be something like this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
and it should be something like this
around<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.070> part<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
around that the first part will be the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.920 
around that the first part will be the
same<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> rest

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
same all the way up to one then the rest

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.060 
same all the way up to one then the rest
would<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.110> randomized<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> being<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:31.950> your

would be randomized to being on your
computer<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.759> Mars<00:01:32.909> 1<00:01:33.119> 1<00:01:33.270> 3<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
computer so Mars 1 1 3 so that is that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.190 
computer so Mars 1 1 3 so that is that
now<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.790> IP<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.479> hand<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
now with you that IP in hand you want to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
now with you that IP in hand you want to
go<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> Google<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.310> want<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> type<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
go to Google and you want to type in the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
go to Google and you want to type in the
IP<00:01:39.689> itself<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> would<00:01:41.310> type<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
IP itself now you would type in the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.010 
IP itself now you would type in the
whole<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.119> mine<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.299> demon<00:01:42.659> comes<00:01:42.869> up

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
whole thing but mine are demon comes up

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
whole thing but mine are demon comes up
as<00:01:43.170> single<00:01:43.500> port<00:01:43.649> forwarding<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.399> come

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
as single port forwarding this will come

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
as single port forwarding this will come
up<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.320> for

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
up now if you have not set up one for

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.030 
up now if you have not set up one for
your<00:01:46.619> router<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.369> should<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.880> admin<00:01:48.509> admin

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
your router it should be admin admin

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
your router it should be admin admin
password<00:01:50.040> user<00:01:50.430> names<00:01:50.670> admin<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> then

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
password user names admin and then

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.109 
password user names admin and then
password<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.350> admin<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
password is admin now if it's not that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
password is admin now if it's not that
then<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.540> most<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> set<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.259> something

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
then it's most like you set to something

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
then it's most like you set to something
and<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.640> come<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> he<00:01:57.030> reduced

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and you're gonna come to he reduced

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
and you're gonna come to he reduced
