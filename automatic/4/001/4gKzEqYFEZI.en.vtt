00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.559
 Hello everyone, Sergey, after the recent one 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.130
 Apple ios 7 presentations 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.339
 our phones with you have an iphone 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.679
 there are a lot of new features 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.980
 one of these functions is called asset 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.169
 and stocking what is it with what it is eaten 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.300
 i will tell in today's video let's 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.449
 let's start actively stocking in my opinion 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.940
 quite an interesting idea which 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.000
 develops safety ideas laid yet 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.160
 fine function my iphone or otherwise 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 find my iphone 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.379
 if earlier you could have lost the gadget 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.109
 detect through the program find my 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.640
 iphone on card or remotely delete 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.219
 everything on it, if God forbid in 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 your king or just send 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.190
 a message to the phone this and that when 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.150
 provided your phone is in 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.060
 network or connected to the internet then starting 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.820
 from the release of aes67 everything will be 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 slightly different functions of assets and drawstring 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.710
 arranged very very simple when you 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.350
 Put on your connecting skyclad 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.720
 she binds to your account with 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.420
 from this moment, disable the background file or 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.120
 log out cloud settings hayes 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.630
 it becomes impossible without entering your 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.730
 password for your account like this 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.860
 everything will act in detail I you 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.390
 Iâ€™ll show you my iphone as an example 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.400
 I will show you how this function works. 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 for example, I want to sell my phone 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.810
 respectively, before selling it 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.090
 I must completely clear immediately 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.670
 that i already had ios 7 installed 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.760
 first beta now instead of 6 and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.360
 rolled back and so to clear 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.430
 phone we go to the main construction site 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.130
 reset and then click delete content and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.930
 settings click clear iphone 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.860
 he warns that everything will be all 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.650
 clay and click and the phone is cleaned here I am 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.450
 completely cleared your phone by connecting 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.170
 I see computers like this 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.880
 assets 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.150
 iphone 3 as a matter of fact 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.390
 need to lead your lane first 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.330
 password and click continue 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.130
 after that on me is activated but here 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.740
 what picture to me on the phone that is 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.170
 accordingly , the screen itself appears 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.800
 greet you choose language choose 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.170
 the country offers you its nonsense 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.850
 Wi-Fi networks available and after that 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.780
 Again, here is the inscription of the asset 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.420
 iphone probably need us iphone can 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.720
 will continue to work only after 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.130
 How do you see your likes and password 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.380
 you can escape the necessary authorization 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.750
 only one way to turn off the file 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.970
 my iphone and log out and cloud 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.670
 then stocking assets then 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 will stop working so you need 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.560
 be sure to remember when you will 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.890
 sell your phone either when you 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.380
 will buy if you do not sell 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.750
 forget it done so just not 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.360
 Substitute your future buyer and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.430
