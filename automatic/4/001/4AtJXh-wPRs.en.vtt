00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.109
 Welcome to the new episode of "The Hero You Don't Know". This time, Jax is introduced. 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.781
 If you like, remember to give a compliment and say no more to us to see his skills. 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.703
 Jax’s passive skills increase the number of layers when attacking the tower. 

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.497
 Passive gain is refreshed for each attack 

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.207
 Even if it is full 

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:25.421
 Jax can jump to the target with a flea 

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.549
 But the game says this is a sprint skill. 

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.760
 Indicates that some of the control fields can be shot down in half air. 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.389
 But the damage seems to still cause 

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:39.769
 You just saw the effect of Jax being dizzy or imprisoned, but look at this. 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.315
 Serresi’s E skills shot him down in the air, but the damage will still be caused. 

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.734
 Spell shield can block flea damage 

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.986
 But won't stop Jax from jumping to the target. 

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.156
 Fleas can also jump to our heroes 

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.326
 There are also units like the Jiawen flag Timothy mushrooms. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.958
 Don't forget that you can also use W plus fleas to cause extremely high instant damage. 

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:09.340
 The result of the Jax W skill hitting the rebound and blinding and blocking is very interesting. 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.468
 If you are blinded, your W skills will be completely lost. 

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:15.888
 If Jax hits W on the rebound shield 

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:20.976
 General damage will be bounced but W damage will hit the target 

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.354
 Panson’s block is the same 

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:28.234
 General damage will be blocked but W damage will hit the target 

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:32.488
 Finally, it might be a BUG, ​​if Jax launches E skills. 

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:38.244
 The general attack will be flashed, but if you even W, the attack will also hurt and W skill damage will hit. 

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:41.038
 Even if W skill is a general attack type skill 

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:42.748
 But the spell shield can still block the damage. 

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:46.794
 And it will also block the damage and dizziness of E skills. 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:50.631
 Don't forget that E skills are not singing skills. 

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:55.010
 Jax can still attack and use skills in the state where E skills are launched. 

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:59.223
 (In more detail, it is to block the ability to have a hit effect.) E Skills can also flash the general attack type skills. 

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:01.308
 Like the captain’s Q will be completely blocked 

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:06.981
 (Other examples are: Yzerel's Q and Q's Q, etc.) More interesting, such as Jax's E skills can completely block the Warwick's great 

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.566
 Fiora's big can also block 

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.069
 Spell shields can't block Jax's passive damage. 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.239
 Even if it is very similar to the effect of W skills 

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.326
 Jax can't make a huge magical damage to the defense tower. 

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:25.583
 So I will stay in the state of the third attack forever and I can always hear the sound. 

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:31.130
 Magic attacks are usually done when attacking heroes or creeps. 

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:35.926
 Here are some little knowledge and stories about Jax. 

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:41.640
 Jax is designed by Ezreal, which everyone is familiar with. 

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.226
 His voice actor is Erik Braa. 

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.270
 Also a voice actor of Darwin 

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:50.357
 The name of Jax may be based on the Greek Warrior AJax 

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:56.864
 Or the undefeated weapon master Garet Jax in Terry Brooks’s Shanara series. 

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:03.078
 (The following story refers to Garena translation) Unlike other heroes Jax's before joining the League of Legends 

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.206
 He is still just an ordinary mercenary 

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:10.211
 Former leader of the Alliance, Senior Member, Regina. Ashram doesn't know why 

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:14.048
 Ranked Jax in the top of the list of candidates for the league ruling 

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:17.468
 It is up to the interview result to decide whether to accept the candidate to become a hero in the league. 

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.429
 Jax’s ruling is the fastest record in league history 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:28.145
 Jax created a long list of winning streaks in the land of justice. Many summoners worry that he is too strong. 

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:33.609
 The new leader of the alliance, Haywood. Rayleigh Weiss makes special restrictions on Jax 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.449
 Jax’s response was to use his own lamppost as a weapon but it had no effect on him. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.373
 Regina. Ashram disappeared before Jax went to the league 

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:51.210
 So some people wonder if there is any connection between these two things. 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.090
 Jax seems to be a reference to the Garo in the Mask of the Salda Legend Musula. 

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.427
 Jax in the new version of the League of Legends official website page 

00:04:00.427 --> 00:04:05.516
 You can see that a strange figure behind Jax is probably Oss. 

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:09.853
 But the fist club did not make any confirmation. 

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:15.234
 So many gamers think that Jax is a blood-blooded family. 

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:21.365
 Is one of the remaining five ethnic groups in the story of Oss 

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:29.832
 This may explain why Jax’s body has strange three purple fingers and many eyes. 

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:35.087
 (The hero of this styling is Vandal Jax) The "Destructive" styling seems to be not in the same line as other Vandal stylings. 

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:39.300
 Like Tucci Brand Vladimir and Gulagus 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.931
 Probably because this model is much earlier than other similar names. 

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:51.854
 The "Ghost Warrior" styling may be a reference to Murmillo, a gladiator in the Roman Empire. 

00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:56.817
 Perhaps it is the reference to the protagonist of the "Ghost Warrior" 

00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:06.035
 This styling also pays tribute to Joe Ewing's sarcoma patient. He visits the headquarters of the fist club with the help of the Make A Wish organization when he is sick. 

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:10.247
 He eventually passed away on June 5, 2012. 

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:13.417
 The mobile voice of this style has been changed. 

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:14.793
 "This is for your child." 

00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.963
 Because Jax and this "Ghost Warrior" look is Joe's favorite. 

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:23.469
 The "martial sorcerer" model refers to the samurai in "Penny Street Adventure" 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.472
 Both have a tribute to "The Elf" 

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:30.392
 "Hockey Player" is a reference to the Disney movie "The Ice Commando" 

00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:39.151
 It seems that the fist club did not let the shape of Jax follow the story like these three shapes. 

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:41.862
 Which is using real weapons 

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.573
 It feels a bit awkward with his voice. 

00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:49.078
 Jax: "Think if I have a real weapon." 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.581
 Jax and Gulagus seem to be a pair of friends 

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:55.709
 Look at the page of Jax in the new official website. 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.712
 Jax is a hero of Ionia 

00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:01.924
 Fiora and Jax are rivals 

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:05.886
 This episode of "The Hero You Don't Know" ends here.
