00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 So I think the left side of the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.280
 map the swamp we can completely outside 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200
 nobody will leave it there 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.340
 go through 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.750
 you you need to why now is switching 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.219
 go on, yes I am already I am already 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 right in the clear so I'm already in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 right picture in it so schÃ¶nherr 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 so I find I also first the going 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 first probably the medium 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.279
 want to secure with the e4 of the object of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.510
 I do not know about driving four teams before 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.000
 can be very dangerous and the a 100 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 into the city and the moment is mine 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.520
 I'll wait for you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 surprise me until I'm in town 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 Apple put the e100 is over the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 line if the 89 stop there 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.890
 around here will be up here where 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.570
 One would always be excited, too 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.059
 I do not just share it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 because that's one of the safe things 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.930
 what you quickly mock about tchibo 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.500
 go over the valley fact yes lick me on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 ass 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.030
 That may not be so 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 super stupid 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 that's not silly to the long 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 We're right up to the point where you are 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.180
 then at some point on the cap 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.770
 other keys in front of him hangs falls 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 first a city and something before something 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 happened they have a lot of relatively many 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.220
 panzer yes but that's exactly what you do 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 Clever one back assigned earlier, too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.189
 already the tasi has hinted one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.650
 will stay safe in the back since also on 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.210
 spotted he tries to use the book 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 but I believe that anyway 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.820
 I think that too much down too 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.130
 long but it does exactly what i do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.890
 previously said he had 100 over the a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 line in the city 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 good four would have thought the same 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.159
 that now your object a bit 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.540
 they do not protect that protects themselves 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.780
 yes even in the place because there can 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.000
 shown I would stay there 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.770
 no good position can be the object 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.979
 263 is on the way who want there 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.720
 is all three robbers together 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.340
 I guess now learns left 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.340
 then his surprise or 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.959
 Ducati drive in all three directions 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.709
 that could be the real journalism now 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.760
 required 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.500
 now they have to go but you can too 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.050
 afterwards the cap from below also 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.940
 relatively good, which is why it is not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.209
 it's so stupid for juno if you take your time 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.209
 to let 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.750
 but if they have pushed over now 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 I believe our part can dresser 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.470
 right so it's better time does not work 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.049
 more 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.459
 if I'm right somehow we have 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.900
 still the teenagers yes both clips 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.030
 really hard he comes now that I 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.239
 Simply spotted to the caps so 'n 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:06.060
 run safety was almost too late 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.260
 when you overtake jumbo this is definite 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.329
 Here we are against lucky view 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.090
 but unfortunately are in a fall 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.299
 but advised with Lieferheld landsmann 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.340
 so now I think so too 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.930
 outclassed going that were her 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.880
 heavy armor so not so far from 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.680
 pulled away from the cap because they can 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.620
 from the back still cross over 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.510
 Shoot that is the advantage I find 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.750
 just on the other side 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.769
 has much harder cap to allow 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.180
 the votes of the 50 were discovered he 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.430
 drives also quite wide open where now 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.329
 I'll get a job 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.620
 1 shot the snapshot that he 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.790
 by now they have to be one 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.930
 Now they have to build wagenburg 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.609
 shield each other 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.109
 they do not want to tip okay they 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.659
 now attacks at 50 m 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.519
 so yes the iab goes well for us 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.879
 jowood that does not go well when the 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:07.900
 there are no that will be dangerous 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:09.370
 especially in the hla but are also 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.980
 take in seconds so you have to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.609
 slower again put a hit there 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.630
 but we are on the wrong tank 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.630
 hopefully 50 m 7 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:29.130
 yes that was it or I further object 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.620
 is necessary 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.070
 ok now it was one but complete 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.300
 it works out on the side 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.780
 they just do not seem to come 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.520
 just back there from the city de 4 of 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.830
 just could too well back 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.650
 shoot the cap is just he you can 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.150
 not working properly again comes from 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.460
 the harmless forward in the feed and could 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.599
 from the bend but on it if you have the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.550
 run out of hair 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.250
 but we also have the vehicle setup 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.120
 and each other 15 50 is too much 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.240
 soft whole even the 50 m is relative 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.620
 soft 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.330
 so one I have to have to do everything 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.110
 well done and definitely yes 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.919
 to push through the through the 1 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.740
 so if you are a bit faster 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.780
 would have been because who is I believe 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.070
 come even better but it keeps like 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.110
 you have actually seen them 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.949
 almost hit the perfect timing and 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.949
 it was still not enough
