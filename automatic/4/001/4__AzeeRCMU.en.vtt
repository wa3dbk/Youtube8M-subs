okay<00:00:03.960> so<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.590> is<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.189> new<00:00:05.370> exhaust<00:00:05.759> which<00:00:06.090> is

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
okay so this is the new exhaust which is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.289 
okay so this is the new exhaust which is
launching<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.649> mini<00:00:08.490> one<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.059> Mini

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
launching for the mini one and Mini

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.299 
launching for the mini one and Mini
Cooper<00:00:09.959> from<00:00:10.170> 2002<00:00:11.009> to<00:00:11.160> 2006<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
Cooper from 2002 to 2006 so I will get a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
Cooper from 2002 to 2006 so I will get a
tape<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.700> measure<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.150> exhaust<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.780> we've

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
tape and measure the exhaust but we've

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.230 
tape and measure the exhaust but we've
got<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> fairly<00:00:16.860> large<00:00:17.130> trim<00:00:17.610> it's<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:17.939> largest

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
got a fairly large trim it's the largest

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.599 
got a fairly large trim it's the largest
true<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.740> without

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
true and we think you can get on without

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
true and we think you can get on without
actually<00:00:21.390> changing<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.470> bumper<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> can

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
actually changing the bumper so you can

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
actually changing the bumper so you can
see<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> fits<00:00:23.699> nicely<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.160> original

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
see it fits nicely into the original

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.929 
see it fits nicely into the original
bumper<00:00:27.260> cutout<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:29.699> hand

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
bumper cutout that's on the right hand

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540 
bumper cutout that's on the right hand
side<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.359> our<00:00:30.449> mini<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:30.990> okay<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.400> we've<00:00:32.519> got

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
side of our mini here okay so we've got

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.479 
side of our mini here okay so we've got
a<00:00:32.640> polished<00:00:33.059> tailpipe<00:00:33.629> okay<00:00:34.350> onto<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
a polished tailpipe okay onto a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.689 
a polished tailpipe okay onto a
stainless<00:00:36.059> steel<00:00:36.530> fully<00:00:37.530> welded<00:00:37.949> silencer

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
stainless steel fully welded silencer

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.700 
stainless steel fully welded silencer
there<00:00:38.909> and<00:00:39.150> that's<00:00:39.659> hanging<00:00:40.019> there<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.409> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there and that's hanging there now and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
there and that's hanging there now and
if<00:00:40.769> I<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.070> duck<00:00:41.370> down<00:00:41.400> here<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.510> you've<00:00:42.690> got

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
if I just duck down here so you've got

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.360 
if I just duck down here so you've got
your<00:00:42.960> conventional<00:00:43.589> robbers<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.159> is<00:00:44.280> how

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
your conventional robbers this is how

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.619 
your conventional robbers this is how
the<00:00:44.430> exhaust<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.030> mounted<00:00:45.479> at<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.629> back<00:00:45.890> okay

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
the exhaust is mounted at the back okay

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
the exhaust is mounted at the back okay
so<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> hangs<00:00:48.960> off<00:00:49.199> normal<00:00:49.680> rubbers<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so it hangs off normal rubbers and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
so it hangs off normal rubbers and
you've<00:00:50.790> got<00:00:50.970> this<00:00:51.119> clamp<00:00:51.479> that<00:00:51.600> goes<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.229> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you've got this clamp that goes all the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
you've got this clamp that goes all the
way<00:00:52.379> around<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:53.430> silencer<00:00:54.119> that<00:00:54.150> holds<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
way around the silencer that holds that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.079 
way around the silencer that holds that
on<00:00:55.010> okay<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.400> next<00:00:56.430> part<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> we

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
on okay and then the next part is we

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.579 
on okay and then the next part is we
work<00:00:57.269> down<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.659> exhaust<00:00:57.839> we've<00:00:58.080> put<00:00:58.229> a<00:00:58.260> skid

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
work down the exhaust we've put a skid

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.920 
work down the exhaust we've put a skid
plate<00:00:58.619> here<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.729> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> exhaust<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.750> have

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
plate here so a lot of exhaust just have

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
plate here so a lot of exhaust just have
the<00:01:01.049> silencer<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.189> now<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.909> problem<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the silencer going on now the problem is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
the silencer going on now the problem is
if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.290> speed<00:01:04.619> bump<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
if you go over a speed bump and it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
if you go over a speed bump and it
catches<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.760> edge<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> skid<00:01:07.020> plate<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
catches this edge with the skid plate it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
catches this edge with the skid plate it
slides<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.310> also<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> gives<00:01:09.480> a<00:01:09.660> lot<00:01:09.780> more

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
slides over also it gives a lot more

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
slides over also it gives a lot more
strength<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.620> this<00:01:10.740> joint<00:01:11.160> in<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.700> because

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
strength to this joint in here because

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
strength to this joint in here because
obviously<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.840> triangulated<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.980> joint

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
obviously this is triangulated the joint

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
obviously this is triangulated the joint
and<00:01:14.490> where<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> welded<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.230> weld<00:01:16.440> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and where it's welded there and weld it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
and where it's welded there and weld it
as<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:16.980> as<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.730> exhaust<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.600> gives<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
as well as the exhaust it gives you a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
as well as the exhaust it gives you a
lot<00:01:19.110> more<00:01:19.140> strength<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:20.370> the<00:01:20.430> other<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
lot more strength now the other thing to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
lot more strength now the other thing to
note<00:01:21.180> when<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.390> design<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> exhaust<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.980> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
note when we design this exhaust was we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.120 
note when we design this exhaust was we
try<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.080> depth<00:01:25.410> here<00:01:25.650> that's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
try to get the the depth here that's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
try to get the the depth here that's
visible<00:01:26.370> from<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> car<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:27.930> low

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
visible from the back of the car as low

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.430 
visible from the back of the car as low
as<00:01:28.710> possible<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.580> we<00:01:30.360> felt<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:31.080> could<00:01:31.230> see<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
as possible some we felt you could see a

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.230 
as possible some we felt you could see a
lot<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> silencer<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.640> we've<00:01:32.760> really<00:01:32.970> got

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
lot of the silencer so we've really got

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
lot of the silencer so we've really got
the<00:01:33.360> silencer<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.050> slim<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.620> could<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.190> on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the silencer as slim as we could here on

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.470 
the silencer as slim as we could here on
this<00:01:36.000> design<00:01:36.470> okay<00:01:37.730> well<00:01:38.730> if<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.090> move<00:01:39.270> down

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
this design okay well if we move down

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.720 
this design okay well if we move down
the<00:01:39.690> exhaust<00:01:39.960> we've<00:01:40.230> only<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.620> one<00:01:40.650> join<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
the exhaust we've only got one join in

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.730 
the exhaust we've only got one join in
the<00:01:42.240> system<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.900> system<00:01:43.050> we<00:01:43.350> sell<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the system so the system we sell is a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.000 
the system so the system we sell is a
two-piece<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:45.960> postage<00:01:46.380> we'd<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.830> do<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
two-piece for postage we'd like to do it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.860 
two-piece for postage we'd like to do it
in<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.640> can't<00:01:47.909> post<00:01:48.210> anything<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
in one but you can't post anything that

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.410 
in one but you can't post anything that
long<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.770> we've<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.310> central<00:01:50.820> clamp<00:01:51.090> here

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
long so we've got one central clamp here

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.360 
long so we've got one central clamp here
in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> middle<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.110> tunnel<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.650> can<00:01:53.040> we've

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
in the middle of a tunnel I can we've

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.890 
in the middle of a tunnel I can we've
actually<00:01:53.520> world<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> top<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
actually world of it at the top you

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.930 
actually world of it at the top you
can't<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.440> here<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.550> clamp

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
can't see on here so that this clamp

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.010 
can't see on here so that this clamp
will<00:01:57.180> never<00:01:57.420> sort<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.440> come<00:01:59.190> loose<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
will never sort of come loose and and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.830 
will never sort of come loose and and
rattle<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:02.760> also<00:02:03.000> makes<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> easy<00:02:03.630> when

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
rattle around it also makes it easy when

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
rattle around it also makes it easy when
you're<00:02:04.020> assembling<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.220> you're

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you're assembling it because you're

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.449 
you're assembling it because you're
going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.610> hold<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.940> clamp<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.479> place<00:02:06.510> okay

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
going to hold the clamp in place okay

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.249 
going to hold the clamp in place okay
and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.090> come<00:02:09.269> down<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> exhaust<00:02:09.989> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and then if we come down the exhaust so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
and then if we come down the exhaust so
if<00:02:10.319> you're<00:02:10.470> changing<00:02:10.709> exhaust<00:02:11.310> you'll<00:02:11.490> need

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
if you're changing exhaust you'll need

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
if you're changing exhaust you'll need
to<00:02:11.760> remove<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.180> under<00:02:12.540> tray<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.470> which<00:02:13.680> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to remove this under tray here which is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
to remove this under tray here which is
just

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.569 
just
in<00:02:14.439> with<00:02:14.650> these<00:02:14.890> bolts<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:16.150> carries<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
in with these bolts and that carries the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.759 
in with these bolts and that carries the
middle<00:02:18.579> rubber<00:02:19.060> mount<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.019> can<00:02:20.230> see<00:02:20.470> here

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
middle rubber mount you can see here

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.100 
middle rubber mount you can see here
which<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.459> locate<00:02:22.209> onto<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.599> plate<00:02:22.900> so

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
which just locate onto this plate so

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.920 
which just locate onto this plate so
this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.409> relatively<00:02:23.920> easy<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:25.150> remove<00:02:25.480> just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
this is relatively easy to remove just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.220 
this is relatively easy to remove just
on<00:02:26.079> a<00:02:26.110> set<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.470> car<00:02:26.680> ramp<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.019> takes

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
on a set of car ramp and then that takes

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.660 
on a set of car ramp and then that takes
us<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.709> front<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.220> here<00:02:30.370> you've<00:02:30.459> got<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
us to the front so here you've got the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
us to the front so here you've got the
catalytic<00:02:31.239> converter<00:02:31.360> which<00:02:31.780> isn't<00:02:32.019> part<00:02:32.409> of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
catalytic converter which isn't part of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.770 
catalytic converter which isn't part of
the<00:02:32.680> exhaust<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the exhaust and here you can see that it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.449 
the exhaust and here you can see that it
started<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> discolor<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.860> exhaust<00:02:36.280> we've

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
started to discolor the exhaust we've

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.960 
started to discolor the exhaust we've
had<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.209> week<00:02:37.390> now<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.700> supply

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
had this on for a week now and we supply

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
had this on for a week now and we supply
a<00:02:40.060> new<00:02:40.269> gasket<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.109> joint<00:02:41.440> here<00:02:41.709> we<00:02:41.890> also

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
a new gasket for this joint here we also

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.660 
a new gasket for this joint here we also
supply<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:43.390> bolts<00:02:43.840> new<00:02:44.049> bolts<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
supply the the bolts new bolts so that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.670 
supply the the bolts new bolts so that
sort<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.180> take<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.659> off<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.959> fairly<00:02:47.170> easy<00:02:47.319> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
sort of take it off it's fairly easy you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.099 
sort of take it off it's fairly easy you
just<00:02:47.709> go<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.040> undo<00:02:48.400> those<00:02:48.609> bolts<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.299> release

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
just go to undo those bolts and release

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.680 
just go to undo those bolts and release
it<00:02:50.319> from<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.590> hangers<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:52.329> is<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it from the hangers but that is the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.210 
it from the hangers but that is the
exhaust<00:02:52.989> we'll<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.379> now<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.590> we'll<00:02:53.769> go<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.190> a

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
exhaust we'll do now is we'll go for a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.699 
exhaust we'll do now is we'll go for a
little<00:02:54.459> bit<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.810> run<00:02:55.810> outside<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.650> can

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
little bit of a run outside so you can

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.199 
little bit of a run outside so you can
try<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.099> get<00:02:57.370> an<00:02:57.519> idea<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.079> tone<00:02:59.829> of<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
try and get an idea of the tone of the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.270 
try and get an idea of the tone of the
exhaust<00:03:01.629> okay<00:03:02.139> so<00:03:02.200> here<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.739> are<00:03:02.769> now<00:03:03.040> we're

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
exhaust okay so here we are now we're

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.970 
exhaust okay so here we are now we're
out<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:04.109> from<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.200> ramp<00:03:05.409> so<00:03:05.680> we'll<00:03:05.829> just

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
out of a out from the ramp so we'll just

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.949 
out of a out from the ramp so we'll just
get<00:03:06.099> another<00:03:06.280> look<00:03:06.549> at<00:03:06.670> how<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:06.970> sits<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:07.900> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
get another look at how it sits so you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.660 
get another look at how it sits so you
can<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.440> doesn't<00:03:08.650> stick<00:03:08.980> out<00:03:09.190> too<00:03:09.430> far

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
can see it doesn't stick out too far

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.059 
can see it doesn't stick out too far
we've<00:03:09.940> really<00:03:10.209> tried<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.599> get<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.560> right<00:03:11.829> so

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
we've really tried to get just right so

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.379 
we've really tried to get just right so
you<00:03:12.159> can<00:03:12.340> notice<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.849> but<00:03:13.000> you're<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.180> going

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
you can notice it but you're not going

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.899 
you can notice it but you're not going
to<00:03:13.450> bang<00:03:13.690> your<00:03:13.900> shin<00:03:14.109> on<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.349> every<00:03:14.560> time<00:03:14.909> as

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
to bang your shin on it every time as

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.759 
to bang your shin on it every time as
you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.599> sits<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.170> there<00:03:17.409> nicely

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
you can see it sits in there nicely

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.129 
you can see it sits in there nicely
we've<00:03:18.489> got<00:03:18.669> a<00:03:18.699> little<00:03:19.150> bit<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.419> silencer

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
we've got a little bit of the silencer

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.869 
we've got a little bit of the silencer
but<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.410> think<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:21.010> that's<00:03:21.370> class-leading

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
but we think that that's class-leading

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.509 
but we think that that's class-leading
in<00:03:22.599> terms<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.049> how<00:03:23.199> much<00:03:23.379> silencers<00:03:24.099> visible

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
in terms of how much silencers visible

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.180 
in terms of how much silencers visible
we<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.359> have<00:03:25.449> tried<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.780> get<00:03:26.019> that<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:26.980> low

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
we really have tried to get that as low

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
we really have tried to get that as low
as<00:03:27.340> possible<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.790> certainly<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.449> if

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
as possible and certainly if you if

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.720 
as possible and certainly if you if
you're<00:03:29.379> driving<00:03:29.590> behind<00:03:30.069> or<00:03:30.280> walking<00:03:30.579> behind

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730

and let's see if we can just do some

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.949 
and let's see if we can just do some
basic<00:03:40.000> shot<00:03:40.569> in<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.870> car<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.359> did<00:03:43.660> what<00:03:43.840> it

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
basic shot in the car and I did what it

00:03:43.959 --> 00:04:11.330 
basic shot in the car and I did what it
sounds<00:03:44.410> like

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.710 

okay<00:04:12.340> we're<00:04:12.460> joined<00:04:12.670> do<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.850> video<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.480> car

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
okay we're joined do a video in the car

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.170 
okay we're joined do a video in the car
to<00:04:13.960> give<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.170> an<00:04:14.230> idea<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.620> how<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.700> drives<00:04:15.940> and

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to give you an idea of how it drives and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.490 
to give you an idea of how it drives and
what<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.359> sounds<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.959> car<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:17.380> we've

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
what it sounds like in the car so we've

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.410 
what it sounds like in the car so we've
turned<00:04:17.709> off<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.160> stereo<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.820> fan<00:04:19.030> again

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
turned off the stereo on the fan again

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.870 
turned off the stereo on the fan again
so<00:04:20.260> here<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.709> go<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.890> is<00:04:27.100> fairly<00:04:27.340> quiet<00:04:27.640> in

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
so here we go so this is fairly quiet in

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.980 
so here we go so this is fairly quiet in
the<00:04:27.970> car<00:04:28.150> it's<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.420> too<00:04:28.540> bad<00:04:28.720> there's<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
the car it's not too bad there's a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:45.730 
the car it's not too bad there's a
little<00:04:29.230> bit<00:04:29.380> more

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.320 

so<00:04:46.740> yeah<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:46.949> certainly<00:04:47.159> goes<00:04:47.429> okay<00:04:47.849> with<00:04:48.089> the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
so yeah it certainly goes okay with the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.739 
so yeah it certainly goes okay with the
new<00:04:49.319> exhaustion<00:04:50.009> but<00:04:50.909> it's<00:04:51.029> not<00:04:51.179> too<00:04:51.389> quiet

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:51.749 
new exhaustion but it's not too quiet

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.049 
new exhaustion but it's not too quiet
not<00:04:51.899> too<00:04:52.080> droning<00:04:52.529> especially<00:04:52.919> on<00:04:53.039> one<00:04:53.219> long

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:54.059 
not too droning especially on one long

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.879 
not too droning especially on one long
runs<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.569> you<00:04:54.689> just<00:04:54.839> drive<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.259> it<00:04:55.379> sensibly

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
runs if you just drive in it sensibly

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.129 
runs if you just drive in it sensibly
it's<00:04:56.669> quite<00:04:56.999> nice<00:04:57.179> but<00:04:57.449> if<00:04:57.569> you<00:04:57.659> put<00:04:57.869> your<00:04:57.959> foot

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
it's quite nice but if you put your foot

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.499 
it's quite nice but if you put your foot
down<00:04:58.249> we'll<00:04:59.249> just<00:04:59.429> pull<00:04:59.610> out<00:04:59.759> a<00:04:59.789> disjunction

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
down we'll just pull out a disjunction

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:13.709 
down we'll just pull out a disjunction
here<00:05:00.860> one<00:05:01.860> more<00:05:02.099> Revit<00:05:02.520> game

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.469 

laughs<00:05:14.349> we<00:05:14.499> drive<00:05:14.769> it<00:05:14.889> sensibly<00:05:15.339> of<00:05:15.549> the<00:05:16.269> road

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
laughs we drive it sensibly of the road

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.499 
laughs we drive it sensibly of the road
noise<00:05:16.719> along<00:05:17.049> is<00:05:17.309> as<00:05:18.309> much<00:05:18.519> as<00:05:18.759> eggs<00:05:18.969> or<00:05:19.179> snow

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
noise along is as much as eggs or snow

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.519 
noise along is as much as eggs or snow
so<00:05:21.329> there<00:05:22.329> we<00:05:22.389> go<00:05:22.419> so<00:05:22.749> that's<00:05:22.869> our<00:05:23.439> little

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
so there we go so that's our little

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.599 
so there we go so that's our little
exhaust<00:05:24.039> demonstration<00:05:24.879> video<00:05:25.179> finished
