 now that we've learned how to assign 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.980
 hot keys and let's look at 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.270
 next tab 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.490
 and wolf show 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.619
 here you point the program on which 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.320
 began to apply your hot keys 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.390
 I want to mark the table mode under my arm when 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.280
 you play a lot of tables this mode 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.480
 can be very helpful 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.180
 in this mode all hotkeys 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969
 act on steel 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.919
 where your cursor is 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.419
 you just need to move the cursor to the desired table 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.459
 and press hotkeys 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.379
 further i would like to nominated a hot 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.499
 key to move between the pillars 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.619
 when you press this key the program 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.389
 will move the cursor to that table 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.759
 for which you are waiting for care you can 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.169
 use this key for quick 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:27.730
 search 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.389
 such tables is a very convenient feature 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.279
 further i would like to tell and tabs 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.679
 and the guy 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.339
 tab data can be specified 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.559
 default bid amount 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.319
 these values ​​will be automatically 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.290
 skip matched for betting 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.899
 when is your turn 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.569
 This is a very handy tool for 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.099
 performing automatic 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.759
 rates 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.019
 for example, preflop is lighter than four 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.159
 big blind 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.319
 plus one happens on one linter 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.659
 now 3 could not be automatically 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.509
 count enable charter based on 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.670
 number of liters 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.989
 and bring these values ​​the victory became 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.299
 here you can specify the standard rate for 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.200
 preflop 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.520
 if you have a flight, it will be 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.469
 standard size of your release 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.589
 below you can specify automatic 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.229
 bets for the next flop streets let 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.680
 it will be 80 percent of the bank 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.140
 this is a good bet to learn about 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.180
 power of your opponents on the flop 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 let's not bet 75 percent of the bank 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.189
 and 70 percent of the river bank 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.659
 also i would like to include rounding 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.579
 t was not forget rounds may 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.009
 bets up to one small blind 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.799
 This is a handy feature if you do not want 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.639
 for example, constantly betting type 7 bets 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.309
 dollars 53 cents 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.659
 many useful features are found in 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.109
 tab but insis 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.680
 first useful feature then 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.259
 automatically take backup time 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.499
 every time the rub will offer you 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.649
 take the backup time you could not be 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.529
 automatically agree through 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.209
 every 5 seconds 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.699
 thanks to this feature you don’t 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.129
 will have to constantly keep track of time and 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.069
 was not doing anything for you 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.799
 I would also like to use the function 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.629
 intellectual sitall before big 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.579
 good 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.229
 assigned to this hotkey 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.180
 every time you press this key 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.680
 when is your turn put down 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.729
 big blind 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.569
 and make the cheesecake motive 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.119
 sitalo for all became anna if you play 

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:22.159
 many eatery want to finish 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.860
 session 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.319
 just press this hotkey and 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.379
 the program will help you competently leave 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.370
 every pillar 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.349
 without spending extra money on the blinds 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.399
 further we will consider functions with in the tab 

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.990
 about nko son 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.740
 one of the most useful 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.030
 Functions for porridge puncture will be functions 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.920
 automatic table seating 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.169
 and buying chips 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.550
 I would like to enable the option automatically 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.640
 to take place 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.279
 and automatically fill in the buy in window 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.139
 now every time and when opening 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:51.970
 new pillar 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.690

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.629
 number of chips 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.649
 in this case it is one hundred percent 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:00.550
 maximum possible battles on 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.389
 Once again I would like to note that this 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.110
 very important and useful features for 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.750
 pedestrians cove all you need to do is 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.860
 just open 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.039
 several tables 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.800
 and the rest of the table cannot be done for you 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.620
 also i would like to nominate hot 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.009
 the key for the function to close is left 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.199
 after you did 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.900

 and you were not automatically 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.969
 will close all open became 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.799
 it is a very convenient way quickly 

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:28.219
 finish the session 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.419
 at the end I would like to go to the generale tab 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.270
 and activate the shutdown feature 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.370
 hot keys this is the main hot 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.669
 keys after pressing which the rest 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.360
 hot key stops working 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.249
 after pressing three keys, this field a 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.120
 also the icon is overflowing tomorrow them 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.370
 turns red 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.190
 that means all hotkeys 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.190
 disabled 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.580
 if you press again in this key 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.180
 but all hot keys again 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.939
 turn on 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.429
 this function is necessary 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:55.989
 use when you want something 

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.300
 write in chat 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.960
 or make but player price 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.690
 further as I promised 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.349
 played a little net 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.610
 the first thing you see is like this 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.000
 cannot automatically 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.460
 land me outposts and buy chips 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.310
 here I am already caught anja me 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.669
 highest possible buy and I 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:14.809
 ready to play 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.319
 and so open a few tables 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.259
 when it's my turn 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.800
 table cannot automatically contribute 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.599
 personally bid in this field 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.399
 as you remember it four big 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.779
 blinds plus one blinds inter 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.969
 in this case it's 8 cents 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.009
 euro experience and rooting key 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.669
 to make a quick bet 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.759
 from the podium, it turns out faster 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.520
 more convenient 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.930
 red frame around active became 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.339
 flashes every time 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.339
 when you press hotkeys 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.120
 my turn came at the other table 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.039
 again we see that the field has already been entered 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.930
 standard rate 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.569
 again 8 cents 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.970
 and here we see that on the flop 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.390
 already bid eighty 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.110
 interest from the bank
