00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.960
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.600
 occasion we are in another tutorial of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.460
 refreshing and delicious drinks 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.799
 this time we will make a cream of 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.290
 whiskey type bailey and for this 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.190
 we will occupy the following ingredients 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.400
 we are going to need 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.660
 condensed milk 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.370
 whiskey evaporated milk 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.690
 coffee 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.120
 and vanilla 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.190
 and the procedure is as follows 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.400
 we will start by noticing the milk 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.400
 evaporated 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.780
 in a fret and the measurements will be two 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.780
 cups 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.539
 once we are pouring we are going to throw 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.750
 our mixture half a cup of milk 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.750
 condensed 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.229
 once the condensed milk is poured 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.700
 we will pour a tablespoon or half 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.700
 vanilla spoonful 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 Once the vanilla is poured, let's 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 pour two tablespoons of coffee that is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 half cope earth 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.830
 we must be careful not to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.730
 invest him talk and a lot of coffee because if 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.350
 not because it will lose the characteristic flavor 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.689
 of this cream 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.860
 and now vert we have what is a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.860
 whiskey glass 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.939
 well and now very carefully with a 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.210
 blender we will return all 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.210
 ingredients 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.650
 once we have stirred all the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.780
 ingredients and that we have noticed 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.350
 that the coffee beans were good 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.130
 dissolved is advisable to try our 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.410
 drink whether it lacks more 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.940
 sweetener or not that would be to your liking 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.140
 also this drink can be saved in 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.150
 a bottle or in a jar or you can 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.390
 last us in the refrigerator 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.820
 this is for its conservation as there 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.640
 to our liking now they see it 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.160
 we believe in our glasses to decorate it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 and if they want it even colder in this 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.850
 case then everything ingredients were 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.320
 refrigerated and the temperature is fine 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.410
 but if they want it colder add 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.800
 ice 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.420
 how can you cool the cup with the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.480
 earlier this can be seen in 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.909
