00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 what to train a dog tasty 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.560
 pet shop or simple sausage 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.460
 train need to burn short 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.679
 blocks because you are not a mane dog 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.139
 active here and these classes and they 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.500
 get bored quickly and you can't let that happen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.470
 that here we are and we gave rest here it is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.840
 runs with perseus rejoices so let's 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
 will return the team to lay on emphasize 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.539
 in the moment when he became quite 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.870
 wooden and he wanted to lie down and even 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.309
 did not want to head for food to lower legs 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 i like i know very well i am straight 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 I feel I feel that he is tired of this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 process and no goodies are needed 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 whether heat can be more delicious 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 delicacy could play its good 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.309
 the role of russian or cheese i can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.989
 assume for the dog 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.799
 unconditioned cheese or sausage sausage 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.990
 is a more delicious delicacy but I 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.780
 I do not know what I can be sure and give 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 dog these things 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.880
 what you have any objections first 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 the vet said that to him by 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.670
 can not surrender 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.570
 that for him it is very good well it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 serious argument opinion of the vet 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.610
 honestly but i heard a lot of that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.340
 dogs, in principle, Smirnov days 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.869
 it is advisable to believe in this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.320
 or Gorbachev to talk about what is not 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.010
 let's them the worst 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 although she 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.310
 trolls analysis came just the same with 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 slices of cheese 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.570
 I was told not to take an example well yes to me 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.160
 like you 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.110
 then see if you use feed 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.240
 which is not very tasty for a dog then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.120
 eat dry and here it is from the pet store 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.880
 so -called snacks mean dog 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.980
 should be either more hungry or you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 should be more competent and technical 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.420
 or you need to build the whole scheme 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 learning is very very consistent 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
 breaking into the smallest small stages 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.430
 so that learning goes very easy and simple 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 once you have a good one 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.650
 motivational object is good zhrachka 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 you can make mistakes dog all 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.370
 Equal will work or you can 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.770
 skip some stages anyway 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.320
 strong dog motivation can work 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.270
 of course work and dry food if 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.459
 the vet said dogs dog 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.160
 which is allergic 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.160
 no questions but it's so myasko 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.380
 well this is not a dry food that feeds 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.300
 dog he's just dry un in himself 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.350
 anyway less interesting dogs than 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.230
 sausages for 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.780
 and this never wimp I myself 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 sausages and dogs will not pick them 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.269
 because you are watching rats paper mages 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.910
 I fully support you just the result 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.650
 what are our conversations that yes good you 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.200
 train your dog with these 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.209
 yummy from the store you then 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.160
 should just very consistently and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.760
 properly and accurately train the dog 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.660
 that's all as an occupation lasts enough 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.730
 for a long time yes itâ€™s like these goodies 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.370
 which 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.140
 they are well from one pack yes that is only 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.220
 one same kind 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.799
 only sweets take a long time 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.810
 maybe i think it will be an option if i 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.140
 I will have at least a few tastes and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.830
 several kinds of brother that he threw 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.709
 yes you can and one listen to one 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.319
 softer there can there what dried 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.290
 easy or liver there happens too such 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.690
 cubes but their millions of such nyashek can 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.790
 be right brother a few tastes and not 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.879
 passed well well, in general, the result is clear 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 let's have a break now 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.900
