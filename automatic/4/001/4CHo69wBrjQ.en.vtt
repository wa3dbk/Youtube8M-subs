00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.699 
and we're gonna slice it with each knife
to<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.630> well<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> doesn't<00:02:04.440> blend

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
to see how well they it doesn't blend

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.109 
to see how well they it doesn't blend
the<00:02:04.890> layers<00:02:05.069> together<00:02:07.009> first<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.789> super

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the layers together first the super

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.839 
the layers together first the super
slicer<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.610> looks<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
slicer and here it is and it looks the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.820 
slicer and here it is and it looks the
same<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.660> super<00:02:19.049> slicer<00:02:19.260> does<00:02:19.620> do<00:02:19.799> a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
same so the super slicer does do a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.729 
same so the super slicer does do a
really<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.459> job<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.910> clean<00:02:21.840> even<00:02:22.440> cuts

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
really good job of clean even cuts

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.400 
really good job of clean even cuts
making<00:02:23.670> sure<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> layers<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.200> get

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
making sure that the layers don't get

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.000 
making sure that the layers don't get
blended<00:02:25.590> together<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:28.500> we're<00:02:28.650> using<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
blended together here we're using the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.250 
blended together here we're using the
paring<00:02:29.280> knife<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.720> does<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> pretty<00:02:34.140> good

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
paring knife and it does a pretty good

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.190 
paring knife and it does a pretty good
job<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.680> not<00:02:34.860> blending<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> layers<00:02:35.459> -<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.959> did

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
job of not blending the layers - it did

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.470 
job of not blending the layers - it did
go<00:02:37.350> down<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.590> little<00:02:37.829> bit<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> find<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
go down a little bit but I find it's a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.130 
go down a little bit but I find it's a
really<00:02:39.870> inexpensive<00:02:40.350> solution<00:02:41.930> for<00:02:42.930> when

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
really inexpensive solution for when

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.569 
really inexpensive solution for when
you're<00:02:43.290> cutting<00:02:43.470> layers<00:02:43.769> instead<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.310> buying

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
you're cutting layers instead of buying

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.050 
you're cutting layers instead of buying
the<00:02:44.970> expensive<00:02:45.510> super<00:02:45.840> slicer<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:50.060> lastly

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the expensive super slicer and lastly

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.539 
the expensive super slicer and lastly
the<00:02:51.720> other<00:02:51.870> blade<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:55.130> there<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.250> go

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
the other blade and there we go

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.309 
the other blade and there we go
this<00:02:56.730> four<00:02:57.000> dollar<00:02:57.209> blade<00:02:57.510> did<00:02:58.019> pretty<00:02:58.230> much

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
this four dollar blade did pretty much

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.710 
this four dollar blade did pretty much
the<00:02:58.440> exact<00:02:58.890> same<00:02:58.920> job<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.700> super<00:03:00.030> slicer

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.160
