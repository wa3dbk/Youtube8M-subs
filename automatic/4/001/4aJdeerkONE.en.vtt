00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
don't need to learn to program you just

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.529 
don't need to learn to program you just
need<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> make

way

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
way

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.340 
way
let's<00:02:47.550> pick<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:50.720> let's<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.810> do<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.290> one

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
let's pick one let's just do this one

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.010 
let's pick one let's just do this one
and<00:02:53.120> now<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.180> size

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.170 

we<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.770> add<00:03:00.920> more<00:03:01.160> cabinets<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.880> make<00:03:02.030> them

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
we can add more cabinets and make them

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.600 
we can add more cabinets and make them
all<00:03:02.330> at<00:03:02.450> once<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.200> for<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:03.530> let's<00:03:04.130> process

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
all at once but for now let's process

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.110 
all at once but for now let's process
this<00:03:04.820> one<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.920> machine<00:03:07.250> wants<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.640> verify<00:03:07.820> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
this one the machine wants to verify the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240 
this one the machine wants to verify the
dimensions<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.990> material<00:03:09.440> we'll<00:03:09.590> use<00:03:09.890> it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
dimensions of the material we'll use it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.340 
dimensions of the material we'll use it
we'll<00:03:10.820> adjust<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.330> parts<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.960> exact

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
we'll adjust the parts for the exact

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.240 
we'll adjust the parts for the exact
size<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.250> get<00:03:13.400> perfect<00:03:13.610> joints<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:16.100> at

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
size so we get perfect joints now at

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.490 
size so we get perfect joints now at
once<00:03:16.460> no<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.060> would<00:03:17.360> like<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.570> use<00:03:17.870> material

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
once no if we would like to use material

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.490 
once no if we would like to use material
left<00:03:18.710> from<00:03:19.010> previous<00:03:19.430> jobs<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.140> need<00:03:21.350> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
left from previous jobs we just need to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.710 
left from previous jobs we just need to
scan<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:22.370> for<00:03:22.550> now<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:23.120> will<00:03:23.270> use<00:03:23.330> new

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
scan it but for now we will use new

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.240 
scan it but for now we will use new
material<00:03:25.960> okay<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.290> job<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.710> processed

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
material okay the job is processed

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
material okay the job is processed
here's<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.910> number<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.300> sheets<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.750> each

here's the number of sheets of each

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.040 
here's the number of sheets of each
material<00:03:30.110> we'll<00:03:30.620> need<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:32.180> machine<00:03:32.540> tells<00:03:32.840> us

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
material we'll need the machine tells us

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.050 
material we'll need the machine tells us
to<00:03:33.200> load<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.590> first<00:03:33.830> sheet<00:03:34.160> if<00:03:34.700> we're<00:03:34.940> ever

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
to load the first sheet if we're ever

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.790 
to load the first sheet if we're ever
not<00:03:35.270> sure<00:03:35.300> what<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:35.960> there<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.350> ShowMe

button that plays a quick video to
explain<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.870> we'll<00:03:39.680> slide<00:03:40.010> our<00:03:40.040> sheet<00:03:40.460> onto

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
explain it we'll slide our sheet onto

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.680 
explain it we'll slide our sheet onto
the<00:03:40.850> table<00:03:41.300> up<00:03:41.510> against<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.080> stop

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.030 

what's<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.810> machine<00:03:48.140> sense<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.710> sheet<00:03:48.920> is

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
what's the machine sense is the sheet is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.400 
what's the machine sense is the sheet is
in<00:03:49.190> position<00:03:49.520> vacuum<00:03:50.180> turns<00:03:50.360> on<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.960> hold<00:03:51.200> it

while<00:03:54.860> running<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.250> machine<00:03:55.610> I'll<00:03:55.820> use<00:03:56.030> this

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
while running the machine I'll use this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.330 
while running the machine I'll use this
clicker<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.720> talk<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.980> way<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.190> don't

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
clicker to talk to it that way I don't

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.770 
clicker to talk to it that way I don't
have<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.670> go<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> screen<00:03:59.150> each<00:03:59.390> time<00:03:59.420> it

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
have to go to the screen each time it

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.130 
have to go to the screen each time it
needs<00:03:59.960> something<00:04:00.340> we're<00:04:01.340> ready<00:04:01.900> click<00:04:02.900> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
needs something we're ready click and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.860 
needs something we're ready click and
we're<00:04:03.800> cutting

while it's running pressing the clicker

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.820

will<00:04:09.459> stop<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.599> means<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.230> don't<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.620> to

I need to be back sometimes parts are

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.970 
I need to be back sometimes parts are

machined off both sides the cut Center

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.470 
machined off both sides the cut Center
will<00:04:27.130> group<00:04:27.340> these<00:04:27.490> parts<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.270> first

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
will group these parts on the first

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.090 
will group these parts on the first
couple<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.960> sheets<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.919> back

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
couple of sheets and do the back

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.640 
couple of sheets and do the back
operations<00:04:30.850> first<00:04:31.120> then<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.080> tells<00:04:32.320> me<00:04:32.500> to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
operations first then it tells me to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.820 
operations first then it tells me to
flip<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.010> sheet<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.970> we<00:04:34.090> can<00:04:34.240> do<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.510> front

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
flip the sheet so we can do the front

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.140 
flip the sheet so we can do the front
this<00:04:35.830> flipping<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.460> sheet<00:04:36.700> thing<00:04:36.970> is

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
this flipping the sheet thing is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.010 
this flipping the sheet thing is
actually<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.690> lot<00:04:37.990> easier<00:04:38.020> than<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.710> sounds

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
actually a lot easier than it sounds

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.430 
actually a lot easier than it sounds
just<00:04:41.020> slide<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.560> sheet<00:04:41.770> into<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.220> clamp<00:04:42.550> and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
just slide the sheet into this clamp and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:57.990 
just slide the sheet into this clamp and
crank<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.530> over

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.490 

I'll<00:04:59.000> press<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.540> clicker<00:04:59.750> to<00:05:00.020> raise<00:05:00.260> the
