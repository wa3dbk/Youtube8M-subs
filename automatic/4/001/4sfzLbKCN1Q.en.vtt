00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 In order to see the function of the change of door Itteyuu to calculate what an average rate of change 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 It is something that connects the way change on the curve and calculates the kennel there 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.520
 So what kind of thing is it? 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:31.430
 Suppose there are points a and p 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.430
 It is at this time ab It is to calculate the slope of the straight line ab 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.469
 If it is processed, it will be understood that the average manager between this point a and the point day 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.469
 It is a thing 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 In the case of actually calculating the head in thinking about such a right triangle 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 The height of this triangle at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.090
 Length of the bottom side of the vertical here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.950
 If cracks in the transverse direction 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:05.190
 The manager of this curve is that you can understand the inclination 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:11.550
 Because it's just this is the only management's ab 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:14.659
 But it is considerably Zatsuna why is the management's inclination in 10 a 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.850
 Do you completely different reason and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:25.950
 I Are You rise of the curve in the world because 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:31.829
 You need to improve the accuracy a little to get 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:37.320
 Then I want to ask for a manager at point a from here 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:44.360
 What do you do? It is not d but a place closer to a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.360
 That is to say it I will be rewarded by calculating the average of that is the rate of change I inspection 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:55.750
 Be puzzled thing or a is a point as c say Well this is not the b and say ne 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:00.850
 I'm thinking about opening a shop a day more than b 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.220
 It is to say eh Well should I calculated by the inclination of such ac in this way 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.130
 Ne 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.090
 Gradually approaching gradually to it management by it-out direction at No 10 a if so 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.090
 It means that it will come 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.160
 Tteyuu right next to a dash of a to true it's been doing this all the time 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.350
 Of the place 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.350
 You just need to calculate the slope 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:33.640
 Looking at the slope of the tangent at 10 a in the end according to this kind of feeling 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.530
 It will be 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:42.040
 It means that you will feel like you hit a straight line 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.260
 Yes, in and say something I slope of the Yukitoki 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:52.810
 I There is as it were feel like efficacy was touched at the It is this curve a 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.770
 If you say it's crooked like that, you have such an image and you can figure it out numerically 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.770
 It is that
