00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.440
 the news has shocked those who thought the glaciers were going to 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.369
 disappear in sicarios or more 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.750
 Unfortunately, according to Nasa itself 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.160
 the layers of ice that have always covered the planet are close 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.680
 will disappear ten years ago it is wasted that the glacial ocean 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.479
 arctic 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.269
 courtesy to be without ice 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.010
 at the time 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.250
 not this time 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 p for 2050 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.050
 about 2020 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 be ten years 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 franc of 80 years 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.320
 mazinho the ship's scientists before tsonga and the organization 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.290
 environmentalist grint and spies uncovered that remained on the track 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.290
 the island the largest wing in the world 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.290
 has started to thaw quickly from there the girl scientists verified 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.550
 the detachment 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.720
 the ruling establishes 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 existing in the north pole the doctor jason box of the research unit 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 polar progress of osaka and hyogo university in united states have 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 brought the gigantic ice flying over Gandia 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 jajajajajajajaja not now 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 at the end is a great day is the largest freshwater reserve on the planet 2 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.510
 6% and its melting has caused two great tragedies 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.520
 the first is the loss of millions of tons of fresh water that could 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.439
 destined to human consumption and the second reason esaÃºl more terrible and 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 supposes the flood of much of the planet 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
 the first on the pacific islands not that they are almost flush 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.410
 the level of the sea and that can disappear completely fotosub to one 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.720
 or two or three meters 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.840
 and then that's as important as a major as venice monsterrat 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350
 they are right on the edge of the sea 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 i also because it's like Bangladesh one 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.669
 also where in all areas it is at sea level as new 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.819
 york especially bad that they walk 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.530
 Underwater it is good to also remember that Holland has a large part of its 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.530
 territory three meters below sea level 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.709
 to protect themselves the authorities have built dams and dams 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:36.059
 but it is clear that this measure did not protect them from a 6 meter rise in 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 the sea level 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.989
 the investigators assure that it must withdraw completely from the entity 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.190
 in the sea his life c 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.290
 15 meters 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.270
 something 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.839
 gillard commented 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.960
 how right was the goal 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.629
 who in his documentary and the awkward truth propagated in 2006 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.560
 already predicted the disappearance of Greenland as an ice reserve and a 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.069
 great flood 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.340
 we had a problem as serious as this one were 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.049
 the escorts 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.730
 toshiba vodafone apple fire 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.099
 maybe this data 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.359
 founded 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.169
 moment 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.859
 however, it was 1 20 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.729
 the firemen the fire in his cousin we live in the middle of an old museum 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.309
 dig for 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.369
 before visiting our 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.919
 the rest of the planet will also be affected 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.669
 Of course, it is enough to increase the entire coast to six meters of water 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.479
 live where will they be 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.929
 underwater 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.459
 in fact greenland has at least so far 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.089
 one million 700 thousand square kilometers of ice 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.549
 suddenly they will become 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.740
 water the answer of nature 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.140
 to the incredible emission of toxic gases and global warming 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.039
 the gendarmes 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.389
 ronaldo 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.829
 the question is where are we going we are right at the crossroads of 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.799
 assets 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.429
 homeless 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:11.719
 there is 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.979
 few films like the day after tomorrow the chronic trainer of 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.010
 this tragedy announced 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.490
 a flood that comes hand in hand with droughts moon my despair in 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.349
 several areas of the planet 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.840
 Regrettably 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.939
 there is no one 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.939
 they seem to matter 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:39.619
 China will remain the world's factory and united states france 

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:44.239
 england and spain will continue to do nuclear tests at the bottom of the 

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.759
 peaceful while the reserves and trees are disappearing 

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.709
 and all for the sake of progress 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.959
 in any case we leave it with the world map and that according to the own nasa will have the 

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.909
 planet in mendoza of a decade
