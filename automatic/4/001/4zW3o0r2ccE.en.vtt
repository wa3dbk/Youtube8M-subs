so this is a perspective of war as seen

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
so this is a perspective of war as seen
by<00:01:10.920> civilians<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:12.510> did<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> games<00:01:13.110> run<00:01:13.380> on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
by civilians how did the games run on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
by civilians how did the games run on
the<00:01:13.740> alienware<00:01:14.220> computers<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> yeah

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the alienware computers for you yeah

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
the alienware computers for you yeah
really<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.979> game<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
really well actually the game is a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.499 
really well actually the game is a
little<00:01:18.360> demanding<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.650> shaders

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
little demanding because we have shaders

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
little demanding because we have shaders
pretending<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> hand-drawn<00:01:22.500> graphics

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pretending to be a hand-drawn graphics

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
pretending to be a hand-drawn graphics
but<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.610> generated<00:01:24.090> life<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
but it's all generated life so it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.109 
but it's all generated life so it's
pretty<00:01:25.680> demanding<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> works

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
pretty demanding but here it works

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.700 
pretty demanding but here it works
incredibly<00:01:27.900> fluently<00:01:28.829> plus<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.060> some

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
incredibly fluently plus we have some

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
incredibly fluently plus we have some
light<00:01:31.710> effects<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.970> finalized<00:01:33.479> yet<00:01:33.630> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
light effects but not finalized yet so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
light effects but not finalized yet so
you're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.619> better<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you're going to see better in that in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
you're going to see better in that in
the<00:01:36.180> final<00:01:36.509> version<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> works<00:01:37.409> really

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the final version and it works really

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.609 
the final version and it works really
well<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.400> we've<00:01:38.850> been<00:01:38.880> working<00:01:39.299> with

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
well you know we've been working with

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.130 
well you know we've been working with
alienware<00:01:40.619> since<00:01:41.040> years<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.110> good

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
alienware since years so that's a good

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
alienware since years so that's a good
proof<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.479> makes

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
proof that you know it really makes

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.230 
proof that you know it really makes
sense<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:47.009> says<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.549> especially<00:01:47.820> when<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
sense it says a lot especially when you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
sense it says a lot especially when you
stick<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.659> company<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> you're<00:01:49.439> like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
stick with a company and you're like

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
stick with a company and you're like

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
okay this this works we know it works

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.440

initially<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:58.140> making<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.070> Windows

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
initially we're making this for Windows

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
initially we're making this for Windows
Mac<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.790> Linux<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.840> pc<00:02:01.170> computers<00:02:01.680> is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
Mac and Linux so for pc computers is
