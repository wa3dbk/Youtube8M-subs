a drink I just toss it up and catch
behind<00:00:22.320> back<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.189> could<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.430> anything<00:00:23.550> from

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
behind back and I could do anything from

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.720 
behind back and I could do anything from

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
but that's the trick right here it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.999 
but that's the trick right here it's
starting<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:31.019> side<00:00:31.260> throwing<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
starting down on your side throwing it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
starting down on your side throwing it
up<00:00:32.390> catching<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> bring<00:00:34.020> even<00:00:34.260> bringing

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
up catching it and bring even bringing

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.869 
up catching it and bring even bringing
it<00:00:34.890> around<00:00:34.980> um<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.460> mean<00:00:38.460> I've<00:00:38.550> done<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it around um so I mean I've done it

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
it around um so I mean I've done it
where<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.149> tossed<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.200> into<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> air

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
where I'm tossed it way up into the air

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
where I'm tossed it way up into the air
you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> where<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> flip<00:00:42.780> behind

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you can do it where you do a flip behind

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.459 
you can do it where you do a flip behind
it<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.920> double<00:00:44.370> flip<00:00:44.870> all<00:00:45.870> kinds<00:00:46.440> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it you can do double flip all kinds of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
it you can do double flip all kinds of
stuff<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.059> basically<00:00:48.059> let's<00:00:48.239> let's<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.539> into

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
stuff so basically let's let's go into

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.299 
stuff so basically let's let's go into
this<00:00:48.989> trick<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.620> more<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.190> how

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
this trick a little bit more and see how

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
this trick a little bit more and see how
I<00:00:50.340> did<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.360> quickly<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> easily

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I did this and how quickly and easily

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
I did this and how quickly and easily
you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.559> doing<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.890> yourself<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.699> your

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you can be doing it yourself at your

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.869 
you can be doing it yourself at your
next<00:00:54.239> bar<00:00:54.420> tending<00:00:54.660> gig<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> in

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
next bar tending gig I start with it in

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
next bar tending gig I start with it in
my<00:00:56.910> right<00:00:57.180> hand<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
my right hand just like this in a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
my right hand just like this in a
standard<00:00:59.609> standard<00:01:00.120> pour<00:01:00.800> just<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.039> three

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
standard standard pour just two or three

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310 
standard standard pour just two or three
fingers<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> need<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
fingers on is all you need and really

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
fingers on is all you need and really
what<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
what you're going to do and this is the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.170 
what you're going to do and this is the
real<00:01:06.479> trick<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.340> we're<00:01:08.670> standing

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
real trick is that if we're standing

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
real trick is that if we're standing
parallel<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.720> bar<00:01:10.100> you're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
parallel with the bar you're going to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
parallel with the bar you're going to
cheat<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.270> take<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.710> foot<00:01:13.740> or

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
cheat a bit and take your right foot or

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
cheat a bit and take your right foot or
the<00:01:14.310> same<00:01:14.610> foot<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.060> next<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> bottle

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the same foot that's next to the bottle

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.679 
the same foot that's next to the bottle
and<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> forward<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> 45-degree

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and put that forward at a 45-degree

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.830 
and put that forward at a 45-degree
angle<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.670> you're<00:01:21.150> standing<00:01:21.720> at

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
angle so now you're you're standing at

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
angle so now you're you're standing at
an<00:01:21.960> angle<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.250> customer<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
an angle like this to your customer that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
an angle like this to your customer that
way<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> makes<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.290> easy<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.340> catch<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
way it makes it easy for you to catch it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.859 
way it makes it easy for you to catch it
behind<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.540> shoulders

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
behind the back because your shoulders

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
behind the back because your shoulders
up<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> basically<00:01:31.079> we're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.240> toss

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
up more so basically we're going to toss

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
up more so basically we're going to toss
the<00:01:33.509> bottle<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.049> straight<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the bottle up straight up just like that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999 
the bottle up straight up just like that
and<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.570> other<00:01:36.600> hand<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> left<00:01:37.470> hand<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and the other hand the left hand is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.600 
and the other hand the left hand is
going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:39.020> rested<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.860> your
