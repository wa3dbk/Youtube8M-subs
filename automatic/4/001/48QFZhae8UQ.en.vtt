00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.440
 Hello little short little 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.690
 Obzorchik will be today at just such 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.400
 the thing is we have a cartoon university 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.789
 monsters 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.730
 there are such boxes and here are two figures 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.520
 one figure with a VAZ shirt 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.860
 and the second figure is paradise a box with hidden 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.230
 figure we do not know who is there in general 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.070
 inside these boxes some kind of jelly 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.710
 some kind of such a sticky thing and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.270
 inside here is a character hidden there 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.910
 you can bury him there with this little thing 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.610
 you can play in general now I look 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.739
 Well, a cartoon about a long time passed in some 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.860
 sales stores go in this case 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.320
 I bought this store in my shop 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 a toy and and she was in sales 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.020
 cost there two times cheaper than when 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.180
 wood novelty quite let's see what 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.320
 there inside and quick quick with 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.300
 see all sides 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.140
 it is necessary on the other hand we see that here 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.710
 there are more characters here 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.899
 so look from this same series here such 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.389
 here as if it turns out two in one not 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.429
 only two figures but also two of these 

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:15.979
 here 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.569
 close substances how to write them correctly 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.090
 write if you know the exact name 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.539
 set what will be inside let's 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 let's see what's inside there so 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.990
 open cartoon monsters university 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.780
 I liked the second one 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.260
 part of the final 1 part 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 I like more of course but this one 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.710
 the part also doesnâ€™t know anything but the text 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.310
 here inside or that separately okay now 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.070
 look here so look at the liner on 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.009
 liner but how many of them will it be 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.009
 there are only a few really about 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.659
 how many different characters 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.700
 from cartoons for every taste and so 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.530
 initially we had a mike in this 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.310
 the box should have been more accurate then it 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.800
 like a house probably and it looks like 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 the door remember from the first part of these doors 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.550
 and here it seems like this one 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.209
 door portal 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:22.269
 not here inside 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.000
 and here and as if something overdue 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.220
 we put that there is a name 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.250
 the assumption that it could already 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.519
 can spoil these toys long ago 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.700
 On sale in general, that's such a thing though 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:42.310
 there seems to be OK in here little thing she 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.790
 stretches breaks and whom lizun who is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.209
 stinks well stinks somehow 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.730
 not a toxic substance unlike 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.739
 some rodents and I don't know how here 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.609
 need to play it as tonal 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:02.109
 buy us like but this one 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:04.599
 so you can be so play it and so 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.370
 colleagues and send a while he 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:13.450
 sleep good morning oh how did you sleep 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.680
 lormar you walked too well 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.870
 yesterday can be seen but he can give give five 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.599
 this thing hello thing maybe that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.470
 the character that they had there was still some 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.109
 did not show jelly yolk there 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.120
 some kind of like that here it should 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.000
 probably kept this saber 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.769
 this spit is so jelly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.799
 will be filled in this thing and there when 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:44.530
 can immerse it is not here a little bit 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.639
 so not a carbine then look to the table 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.080
 even the ball jumps off a little cool 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.560
 cool 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.640
 so let's put the shirt on and who 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.970
 then the second secret character and this this 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.650
 here is such a thing like two brothers in 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:09.380
 single front door and are here this 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:13.170
 substances in my opinion it seems more 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.320
 I think they go more in this 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.380
 yellow thing stop and not very 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.860
 pleasant occupation 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.260
 so cold and wet or something 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.590
 constantly feel the fingers though remain 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.590
 that's kind of like dry but sensations 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.840
 this is not a pleasant, I tell you, well 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.970
 ok and this one is more suited to him this 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.270
 a piece more suitable here and so 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.040
 do not stay on toys any 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.900
 traces 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.730
 done everything is okay so not on super 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.070
 detailed somewhere on the little here 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.050
 see the paint flowed but it is so 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.600
 such more for fun than for 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.200
 serious are there collections there others 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.800
 toys 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.169
 it's for fun and here it is also possible 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.020
 about this set are two such 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.130
 Doors greenbacks that of course we 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.230
 do that we combine this slime 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.169
 I understand that you are typing a lot 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.729
 and then you really get 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:18.759
 huge considered such a ball with 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:20.529
 and mucus that's how it mucus and she's 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.349
 if you put the rest like this 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:26.889
 spreads out 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.689
 here you can stay something I will call to me 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.699
 a lot of mucus and now with this 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.050
 more interesting probably play I do not know on 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.050
 the camera is like this 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.450
 about saber is a very very unusual thing 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.970
 strange don't know how to relate 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.920
 do you like such things or not but 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.960
 anyway i think kids are cool 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.370
 play this if it's all the more 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:00.250
 harmless don't think such mugs are from 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.840
 The famous company Disney and Pixar will be 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.710
