once it's cooled down you'll remove the
siphon<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> shell<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> shell<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.300> can

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
siphon from the shell the shell you can

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
siphon from the shell the shell you can
say<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.460> fried<00:00:59.460> clam<00:00:59.730> strips<00:01:00.030> put<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> in

stock<00:01:00.960> something<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> siphon

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
stock something like that but the siphon

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.320 
stock something like that but the siphon
is<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.019> most<00:01:04.199> sought<00:01:04.439> after<00:01:04.470> part<00:01:05.330> after

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is the most sought after part after

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
is the most sought after part after
we've<00:01:06.689> removed<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> siphon<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> shell

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we've removed the siphon from the shell

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
we've removed the siphon from the shell
we'll<00:01:08.549> remove<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.150> skin<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> siphon

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
we'll remove the skin from the siphon

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
we'll remove the skin from the siphon
itself<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> you'll<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.729> amazed<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.510> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
itself and you'll be amazed when you see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.190 
itself and you'll be amazed when you see
what<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> looks<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.130> comes<00:01:14.310> up

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
what it looks like when it comes up

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.570 
what it looks like when it comes up
afterwards<00:01:16.200> we'll<00:01:16.590> slice<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> siphon<00:01:17.490> in

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
afterwards we'll slice the siphon in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.120 
afterwards we'll slice the siphon in
half<00:01:17.729> lengthwise

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.330 

and<00:01:24.280> remove<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.270> very<00:01:25.480> core<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:27.190> is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
and remove the very core of it this is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.780 
and remove the very core of it this is
where<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.580> actually<00:01:27.700> siphons<00:01:28.360> all<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:29.790> all

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
where it actually siphons all the all

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.010 
where it actually siphons all the all
the<00:01:31.030> gunk<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:32.380> its<00:01:32.680> stomach<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:34.450> just

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
the gunk into its stomach and then just

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.300 
the gunk into its stomach and then just
wipe<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.380> down<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.710> make<00:01:35.830> sure<00:01:35.950> there's<00:01:36.190> no

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
wipe it down to make sure there's no

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.170 
wipe it down to make sure there's no
excess<00:01:36.670> dirt<00:01:36.970> or<00:01:37.240> mud<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.140> inside

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
excess dirt or mud on the inside

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.640 
excess dirt or mud on the inside
afterwards<00:01:40.180> we'll<00:01:40.330> lay<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.510> down<00:01:40.780> make<00:01:41.619> sure

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
afterwards we'll lay it down make sure

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.380 
afterwards we'll lay it down make sure
it's<00:01:41.890> nice<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.040> dry<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.880> we'll<00:01:42.970> slice<00:01:43.210> it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it's nice and dry and we'll slice it

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.219 
it's nice and dry and we'll slice it
paper-thin<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:45.670> eat<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.970> raw

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
paper-thin so that you can eat it raw

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.390 
paper-thin so that you can eat it raw
some<00:01:47.229> people<00:01:47.470> eat<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.680> wrong<00:01:47.830> some<00:01:48.160> people

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
some people eat it wrong some people

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.940 
some people eat it wrong some people
slice<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.880> thicker<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.390> put<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
slice it thicker and put it and they

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.609 
slice it thicker and put it and they
batter<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:51.610> fry<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.320> me<00:01:53.440> I
