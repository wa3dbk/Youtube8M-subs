those I've got the 15 inch props those
are<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> high<00:00:34.739> efficiency<00:00:35.250> props<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:36.120> I'm

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
are the high efficiency props there I'm

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
are the high efficiency props there I'm
running<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> Panasonic<00:00:38.010> gh4<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.180> with

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
running the Panasonic gh4 on there with

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.580 
running the Panasonic gh4 on there with

that's<00:01:40.110> talking<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.880> AR<00:01:42.360> 8,000<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that's talking to an AR 8,000 so the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.609 
that's talking to an AR 8,000 so the
spectrum<00:01:44.189> AR<00:01:44.520> 8,000<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.329> what's<00:01:45.600> linking<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
spectrum AR 8,000 is what's linking to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.340 
spectrum AR 8,000 is what's linking to
the<00:01:47.130> spectrum<00:01:47.750> DX<00:01:48.750> 18<00:01:49.670> radio<00:01:51.229> some<00:01:52.229> other

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the spectrum DX 18 radio some other

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
the spectrum DX 18 radio some other
stuff<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.180> we've<00:01:54.180> got<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:58.610> Lowell

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
stuff on here we've got the Lowell

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.440 
stuff on here we've got the Lowell
converter<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> HDMI<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:02.450> AV

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
converter here so this is a HDMI to AV

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
converter here so this is a HDMI to AV
converter<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.009> that's<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.430> lets<00:02:05.670> me

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
converter so that's what lets me

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.109 
converter so that's what lets me
actually<00:02:06.829> get<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> footage<00:02:08.459> working<00:02:08.940> from

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
actually get the footage working from

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.840 
actually get the footage working from
the<00:02:09.270> dh4<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.500> gh4<00:02:10.979> into<00:02:11.580> the

the dh4 there's gh4 into the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
fpv monitor you can see that the I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.410

I<00:02:58.970> got<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> Pelican<00:03:00.140> case<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.130> for<00:03:04.130> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
I got a Pelican case for the for the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.020 
I got a Pelican case for the for the
octocopter<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.830> gimbal<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:07.820> whole

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
octocopter and the gimbal so this whole

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.700 
octocopter and the gimbal so this whole
setup<00:03:08.300> right<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:08.630> fits<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:09.890> Pelican

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
props off so the the actual octocopter

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.600 
props off so the the actual octocopter
will<00:03:20.600> fit<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.110> part<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.709> case<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
will fit in this part of the case and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.030 
will fit in this part of the case and
then<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.850> gimbal<00:03:23.360> fits<00:03:24.230> down<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:24.860> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
then the gimbal fits down in there you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.800 
then the gimbal fits down in there you
take<00:03:25.250> these<00:03:25.459> these<00:03:27.459> landing<00:03:28.459> gear<00:03:28.700> off<00:03:28.910> just

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
take these these landing gear off just

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.350 
take these these landing gear off just
from<00:03:30.020> this<00:03:30.170> clamp<00:03:30.800> right<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.550> those
