 what to do when they appear where the border between journalism and 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.850
 literature in non-fiction novels we are talking about a new 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150
 way of telling the story the past 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 today some sections we will speak of those hybrid beings that are born of the symbiosis 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.140
 between some almost always sad events 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.210
 and the exercise 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.390
 to turn them into a story we will do it Juan Ignacio Martínez de Pisón 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.780
 reference writer in this field 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.670

 better jesus lizcano a poet of the libertarian daily life of the verse that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.500

 the stretches 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.400
 formed he said boom because in general they feel called to rescue 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.210
 reality is 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.040
 of a more than likely forgetting 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 We often hear some writers confess that they are not the ones who seek 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 the stories that are born from their pens but are the stories themselves 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 who are going to meet him will be that true he kept them perhaps at the time in some 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.150
 secret place and at the appropriate time in which they have to be counted 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 they deposit their desk however many of these stories have seen the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.570
 light thanks to non-fiction novels a genre halfway between the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.530
 literature and journalism that narrates with the language of the novel facts 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 true that inspires them, without doubt a reality that competes in interest and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.730
 in claw with the hobby 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.050

 lester i how critics value their audience 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.720
 because there are those who really boast to the strictly faithful enclosure that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.329

 to accept that there are many possibilities 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:41.259
 the one who is very scrupulous efe ec that in the images that they are like others 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.609
 so long ago in a more than a decade of 11m 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.359
 believe that there are better and worse moments to rescue certain facts 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.700
 historical has cost a lot that is to speak for example here in Spain 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.659
 the civil War 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.780
 and not watch over that part of our history 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.260
 sometimes those facts are too hot to make a novel 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.629
 maybe they even seem to them in the eleven 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.260
