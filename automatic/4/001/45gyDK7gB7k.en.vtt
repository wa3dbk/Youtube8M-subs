00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.070
 comments on shortages of skilled labor, he leaves for our 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.359
 region 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.710
 between these phenomena that happen during some years 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.879
 it has been called dictating a tense being said workforce blackout 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.449
 but I have already gone through several blackouts, not the power blackout and others are day 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.350
 more this blackout in the house is being quite intense because 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 it takes a very large slice of our economy 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.540
 there is a constant in the strategic rh area that says you want 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.700
 in everyone to be sorry neither can nor can avoid what happened 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.530
 are the ones that happen with the Brazilian model, the economy grows 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.340
 The labor force does not qualify at the same speed if you are to meet the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.700
 growth prospects of the country. 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700

 amateur of AraxÃ¡ points out several losses of business and national opportunities 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.290
 due to lack of labor 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 so either the government forms distant even before making a program 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.600
 which is not likely to happen in the short term. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.490
 or else these gaps in the sacristies of other mac forms and other forms 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.730
 companies should start to start a knowledge management program 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 programs that qualify the professional within the company and not I 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.540
 I have this attitude of waiting for a fully qualified professional to 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.240
 enter company 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.990
 or else these professionals will start looking for fast courses courses 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.640
 technicians with this only of wicks for insertion in the market of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.630

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.020
 the extent to which it occupies public policy does not accompany the growth of
