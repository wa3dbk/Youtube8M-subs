00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello i danil heads and tell you today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 about painting technology technology in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.849
 painting is the rules of use 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.269
 art materials viz 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.150
 paint canvases in soils and so on 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.400
 if you use these rules then the picture 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 will last longer as good as new 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.570
 that is, what kind of it would be written 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 initially besides these rules 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.439
 allow you to achieve maximum 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.430
 expressiveness of art 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.500
 materials use them to the fullest 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.970
 coil if the artist breaks 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 painting technology 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 then over time his paintings change his 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 color most often they either turn yellow either 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.329
 blacken besides pictures can 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 crack 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 or even showered such a picture 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.700
 Requires a serious restoration which 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.770
 costly takes time and that thing 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.989
 offensive she just changes the original and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.239
 opposite pattern written based on 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 technological features are very 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.280
 well preserved and do not require 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 restoration for many years as 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.359
 determine the appearance of the picture 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.700
 which is painted with oil paints 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.420
 well will it persist or not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 First look at the base. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 what is the picture on as 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.420
 the basics can be either canvas 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 either paper or wood or cardboard and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.689
 all other materials first 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 the base must be solid and the paint on 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.320
 she should keep well if the picture 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 written on paper or on cardboard then these 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.540
 paper or cardboard should be tight and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.729
 pasted on something solid 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.189
 otherwise over time they are about butter and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 just crumble into pieces if the picture 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 painted on canvas that is stretched over 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.329
 stretcher then make sure to 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.600
 there were no dents on this canvas 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.430
 creases and folds nodules is possible 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 see from the back of the canvas 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 folds can say that the canvas with 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.430
 paintings either crushed or initially 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 painting on crumpled canvas in places 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.450
 the fold of the canvas the ground may be damaged and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 then crumble 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.530
 the ground is such a special coating 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.360
 composition basis 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.170
 on which they write a canvas or 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 tree or paper and group influences 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 how will look 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.190
 paint put on it and how much 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.230
 firmly they will stay watch out 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.170
 so that the canvas stretched on a stretcher 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.360
 did not sag 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.459
 vibration is bad for 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.690
 preservation of painting 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.680
 subframe is such a frame on which 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 stretch the canvas 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.230
 make sure that the stretcher is not 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.290
 curves so that the canvas was stretched on it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.190
 exactly and that the frame was not flimsy 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.800
 all this affects the tension of the canvas and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.630
 the possibility of it sagging colorful 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.930
 layer too can tell something about 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.239
 the future fate of the picture if in the picture 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.209
 a very large layer of paint 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.150
 then most likely it will crack 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.600
 much faster than a thin layer of paint 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.120
 so if you need to dial big 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.470
 a thick layer of paint you need to do it 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.010
 gradually layering not too thick 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.570
 paint layers one on another and give 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.750
 dry each layer well 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.130
 that is why quality made 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.940
 multilayer painting 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.100
 may be created over the years as it should 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900
 would ripen so for example when I wrote 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.780
 my picture of a quiet jetty left me 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.530
 about a year of time just because i 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.720
 tried to keep the technology to this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.570
 the picture is just not cracked and not 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.880
 crumbled from a collector and vice versa 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.430
 very thin layers of paint over time 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.130
 are erased by air and 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.579
 just simply disappear exposing the lower 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.970
 layers make sure that in colorful 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.720
 layer 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.910
 there were no foreign objects if 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.459
 will there be some cilia or hair 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.739
 from the brush there is probably nothing 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.260
 no harm will happen but if it is 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.290
 any pieces of newspapers or anything 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.060
 such it can seriously affect 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.849
 painting preservation treat this 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.660
 very past 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.400
 because the colors look like in the picture 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.919
 also we can assume that they will 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.840
 happen over time but for that 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.380
 need some experience can often 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.610
 see that paint in the picture as if 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.300
 some dirty 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.919
 and this happens not because the paints 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.250
 colors are poorly chosen 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.600
 or just it's gray but because 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.690
 The author added some substances to them. 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.599
 any color be it bright yellow or 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.139
 ocherto gray first must 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.259
 sound 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.229
 pigment they are thinner which was injected 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.039
 in these paints any additives that 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.840
 are introduced into the paint and do not evaporate from them 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.360
 affect color and durability by 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.770
 testimony technologists 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 greatest technology success painting 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.849
 reached the old masters 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.340
 many contemporary artists put 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.259
 tasks that were different from 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.320
 tasks that set themselves old 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.740
 masters and therefore 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.270
 author of modern works and 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.990
 buyers of these works have to 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.389
 often compromise between the unusual 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.370
 the appearance of his work 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.409
 durability and of course 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.680
 technological writing 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.560
 pictures you can learn except from the author 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.900
 this picture or if it is about 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.229
 old picture from restorer 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.120
 or art vienna and so artist 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.430
 useful to know painting technology for 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.680
 to make his paintings longer 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.260
 preserved and in order to have 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.220
 ability to use expressive 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.050
 properties of the materials to the fullest and 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.210
 collector it is useful to know for 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.780
 to be able to choose first 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.580
 the picture 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.340
 and secondly to the paintings of their collection 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.750
 didn't change their colors don't crack 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.810
 did not crumble and did not require restoration 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.699
 this is a fragment of work 60 years ago 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.580
 it is written in oil on paper type 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.880
 vacuum paper promo merged and became 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.570
 fragile and fragile 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.220
 just like potato chips this job 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.760
 written on thin cardboard 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:38.980
 although it is stronger than the previous but all 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:42.380
 equally crack and easily breaks a 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:50.660
 it's cracks in the thick paint layer on 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:53.240
 picture of constantine cow so 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.670
 look crack upper layer of painting 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.500
 which was laid but not enough 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.630
 the dried down paint is the same 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.440
 cracks in the portrait of Pushkin brush 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:10.610
 Cyprian 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:13.880
 and this picture velasquez equestrian portrait 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.130
 philippe 4 he decided to fix the horse 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.220
 hind legs and recorded them in a thin layer 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:22.430
 paint over time this top thin 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:27.680
 a layer of paint began to fade and now u 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.960
