00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just this support I believe where you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
just this support I believe where you
could<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.489> 14-4<00:00:57.559> 2414<00:00:58.559> 440<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.309> would

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
could go 14-4 2414 440 and you would

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.639 
could go 14-4 2414 440 and you would
earn<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> stealth<00:01:00.090> bomber<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
earn a stealth bomber that that is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
earn a stealth bomber that that is
definitely<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.760> fair<00:01:03.030> especially<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.510> ground

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.280 
skills this the way black ops 2 did
everything<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.060> um<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.659> copied

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
everything it's just um if they copied

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.340 
everything it's just um if they copied
the<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.369> owns<00:01:23.580> stuff<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.509> black<00:01:24.900> ops<00:01:25.020> 2<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the way he owns stuff on black ops 2 is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
the way he owns stuff on black ops 2 is
just<00:01:25.560> perfect<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.640> means<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just perfect which means they do it this

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.010 
just perfect which means they do it this
way<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.080> probably<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.710> hard<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.369> out

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
way it will probably be hard to work out

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
way it will probably be hard to work out
specialist<00:01:31.020> maybe<00:01:31.200> every<00:01:31.439> 500<00:01:31.920> points<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
specialist maybe every 500 points you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
specialist maybe every 500 points you
get<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> perk<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.820> something<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.270> i<00:01:33.299> doubt<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
get a perk or something but i doubt that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
get a perk or something but i doubt that
puts<00:01:33.900> specialist<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> game<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
puts specialist in the game then you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819 
puts specialist in the game then you
never<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.299> might<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.869> specialist<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
never know they might put specialist in

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
to modern warfare 3 time zone so we

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.210 
to modern warfare 3 time zone so we
won't<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:16.080> any<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.440> won't<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.800> swarm

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
won't see any so you won't see a swarm

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.520 
won't see any so you won't see a swarm
or<00:02:18.340> anything<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:18.970> might<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.480> hope<00:02:20.410> we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
or anything like that we might I hope we

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.990 
or anything like that we might I hope we
see<00:02:20.680> dogs<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.280> that's<00:02:21.400> sort<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.760> tryout

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
see dogs but that's sort of a tryout

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.630 
see dogs but that's sort of a tryout
thing<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.660> doubt<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.350> see<00:02:23.590> dogs<00:02:23.980> in

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
thing so I doubt we will see dogs in

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.310 
thing so I doubt we will see dogs in
ghosts<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.210> never<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.510> because<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
dog is like the main thing in the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
dog is like the main thing in the
campaign<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.350> never<00:02:29.440> know<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.710> might<00:02:29.770> see

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
