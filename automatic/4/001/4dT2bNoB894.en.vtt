SEO and things like that so I started

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.979 
SEO and things like that so I started
out<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.030> basic<00:00:33.239> title<00:00:33.719> getting

out with this basic title getting
backlinks<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.559> count<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.280> started<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
backlinks to count and as I started to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
backlinks to count and as I started to
write<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.090> article<00:00:36.360> references<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
write this article references and all it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
write this article references and all it
just<00:00:37.530> got<00:00:37.860> longer<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> longer<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> longer

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
just got longer and longer and longer

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
just got longer and longer and longer
and<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.020> occurred<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.460> could

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and it occurred to me that I could

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
and it occurred to me that I could
really<00:00:41.879> add<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
really add so much more to it and so I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
really add so much more to it and so I
thought<00:00:43.860> why<00:00:44.489> publishes<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> blog<00:00:45.570> post

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thought why publishes this a blog post

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
thought why publishes this a blog post
which<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.530> course<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> great<00:00:47.370> blog

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
which of course would be a great blog

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
which of course would be a great blog
post<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.210> why<00:00:48.360> publish<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
post but why publish it that when it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
post but why publish it that when it
could<00:00:49.590> make<00:00:49.770> such<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> great<00:00:50.430> special<00:00:50.879> report

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
could make such a great special report

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959 
could make such a great special report
so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.989> decided<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.860> change<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.699> short

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969

have<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.240> have<00:03:12.480> all<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.840> formatting<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.380> place

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
have to have all the formatting in place

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.100 
have to have all the formatting in place
in<00:03:13.860> order<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.250> flush<00:03:15.090> out<00:03:15.270> my<00:03:15.480> content<00:03:15.990> it's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
in order to flush out my content it's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.020 
in order to flush out my content it's
just<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.470> quirk<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.220> next<00:03:17.460> thing<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.850> is

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
just a quirk the next thing that I do is

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.420 
just a quirk the next thing that I do is
put<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.110> heading<00:03:19.410> 1<00:03:19.440> heading<00:03:19.620> 2<00:03:19.980> heading<00:03:20.100> 3

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
put in the heading 1 heading 2 heading 3

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.430 
put in the heading 1 heading 2 heading 3
i'm<00:03:20.820> assuming<00:03:21.210> i<00:03:21.510> may<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.080> seven

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
i'm assuming i may have like seven

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.140 
i'm assuming i may have like seven
chapters<00:03:22.830> i<00:03:23.010> really<00:03:23.370> don't<00:03:23.520> know<00:03:23.610> yet<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.970> i

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
chapters i really don't know yet and i

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.570 
chapters i really don't know yet and i
can<00:03:24.300> edit<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.600> as<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.020> go<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:26.160> next<00:03:26.370> step

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
can edit that as I go so the next step

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.950 
can edit that as I go so the next step
that<00:03:26.790> I'm<00:03:26.880> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.210> is<00:03:27.330> actually<00:03:27.480> create

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
that I'm going to do is actually create

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.140 
that I'm going to do is actually create
these<00:03:28.140> headings<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.710> what<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.010> does<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.610> it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
these headings and what this does is it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.330 
these headings and what this does is it
makes<00:03:30.180> an<00:03:30.480> outline<00:03:31.020> for<00:03:31.320> my<00:03:31.620> report<00:03:32.070> which

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
makes an outline for my report which

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.280 
makes an outline for my report which
makes<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.730> super<00:03:33.180> easy<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.600> actually<00:03:34.080> sit<00:03:34.230> down

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
makes it super easy to actually sit down

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.810 
makes it super easy to actually sit down
and<00:03:34.440> write<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.860> because<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.220> breaks<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.730> up

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
and write it because it breaks it up

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.990 
and write it because it breaks it up
into<00:03:36.090> topical<00:03:36.960> chunks<00:03:37.710> if<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:37.980> will<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.850> we'll

the next thing is we'll put how to get

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:53.530 
the next thing is we'll put how to get
fast<00:04:41.690> traffic<00:04:51.550> there<00:04:52.550> we<00:04:52.640> go<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.030> now<00:04:53.060> we're

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
fast traffic there we go so now we're

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.730 
fast traffic there we go so now we're
kind<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.750> fleshing<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.169> out<00:04:54.290> here<00:04:54.560> so

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
kind of fleshing it out here so

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.020

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
continuing to rough draft the rest of

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.140 
continuing to rough draft the rest of
those<00:04:58.280> because<00:04:58.520> they're<00:04:58.640> probably<00:04:58.820> going<00:04:59.060> to

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
those because they're probably going to

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.060 
those because they're probably going to
change<00:04:59.390> but<00:04:59.960> basically<00:05:00.320> then<00:05:00.560> now<00:05:00.770> I'm<00:05:00.890> going

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
change but basically then now I'm going

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.409 
change but basically then now I'm going

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
leave the original article in full draft

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.560 
leave the original article in full draft
below<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.640> that's<00:05:13.910> just<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.180> quirk<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.510> mine

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
below that that's just a quirk of mine

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.210 
below that that's just a quirk of mine
also<00:05:14.870> because<00:05:15.290> I<00:05:15.380> like<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.560> have<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.890> all<00:05:15.980> down

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
also because I like to have it all down

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.700 
also because I like to have it all down
there<00:05:16.460> just<00:05:17.300> in<00:05:17.450> case<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.410> we'll<00:05:18.500> put<00:05:18.650> that

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
there just in case so we'll put that

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.320 
there just in case so we'll put that
part<00:05:19.100> there<00:05:19.280> because<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.610> belongs<00:05:19.880> under<00:05:20.090> that

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
part there because it belongs under that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.120 
part there because it belongs under that
heading<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.840> then<00:05:20.930> let's<00:05:21.169> say<00:05:21.410> for<00:05:21.650> example<00:05:21.680> I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
heading and then let's say for example I

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.520 
heading and then let's say for example I
go<00:05:22.310> down<00:05:22.520> here<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.720> get<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.080> next<00:05:24.260> section

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
go down here and get to the next section

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.810 
go down here and get to the next section
that<00:05:24.860> talks<00:05:24.890> about<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.870> nofollow<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:28.580> come

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
that talks about the nofollow and I come

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.850 
that talks about the nofollow and I come
up<00:05:28.850> here<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.540> put<00:05:30.260> that<00:05:30.410> under<00:05:30.770> the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
up here and put that under the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.460 
up here and put that under the
appropriate<00:05:31.100> heading<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:32.600> as<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.050> can<00:05:33.200> see

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
appropriate heading so as you can see

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.170 
appropriate heading so as you can see

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
now I'm actually kind of fleshing things

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.570 
now I'm actually kind of fleshing things
out<00:05:35.419> I'll<00:05:35.690> go<00:05:35.960> back<00:05:36.320> in<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.830> change<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.310> font

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580

out I'll go back in and change the font
I<00:05:37.940> prefer<00:05:38.710> arial<00:05:39.710> 12<00:05:40.130> or<00:05:40.400> aerial<00:05:40.760> 11<00:05:41.150> something

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
like that usually looks good but

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.250 
like that usually looks good but
basically<00:05:44.270> what<00:05:44.750> I'm<00:05:44.870> doing<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.140> I'm

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
report is conceived on my computer it

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.680 
report is conceived on my computer it
starts<00:06:16.400> out<00:06:16.520> usually<00:06:16.850> as<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.300> blog<00:06:17.600> post

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
starts out usually as a blog post

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.200 
starts out usually as a blog post
because<00:06:17.990> that's<00:06:18.410> where<00:06:18.590> my<00:06:18.740> writing

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
because that's where my writing

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.140 
because that's where my writing
generally<00:06:20.210> happens<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:21.200> if<00:06:22.160> I<00:06:22.640> see<00:06:22.850> that<00:06:23.000> it's

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
generally happens and if I see that it's

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.719 
generally happens and if I see that it's
just<00:06:23.450> it's<00:06:23.930> just<00:06:24.190> exploding<00:06:25.190> into<00:06:25.370> something

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
just it's just exploding into something

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.670 
just it's just exploding into something
totally<00:06:25.940> out<00:06:26.210> on<00:06:26.479> its<00:06:26.630> own<00:06:26.780> and<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.289> know<00:06:27.410> into

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
totally out on its own and you know into

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.830 
totally out on its own and you know into
like<00:06:27.830> report

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
like report

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.480 
like report
material<00:06:29.410> then<00:06:29.590> I'll<00:06:29.710> just<00:06:29.889> take<00:06:30.130> it<00:06:30.280> straight

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
material then I'll just take it straight

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.970 
material then I'll just take it straight
over<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:30.880> word<00:06:31.060> and<00:06:31.360> format<00:06:31.810> around<00:06:32.620> it<00:06:32.830> and

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
over the word and format around it and

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.270 
over the word and format around it and
create<00:06:33.460> a<00:06:33.669> short<00:06:33.970> report
