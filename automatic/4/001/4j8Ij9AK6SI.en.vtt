00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.099
 the first thing I would like to say is 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.030
 about the appearance and so we have 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 There are two devices sony ericsson 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 aspen of such white color and sony 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.820
 ericsson aspen black as you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 see, in principle, they are both the same 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.890
 only black color product more 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 early version therefore 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 structurally slightly different from 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.820
 white version here here is their appearance 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.160
 the view is very easy in the hand 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.800
 most of the bends are very smooth 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.290
 and very beautifully all done in hand 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 lies confidently 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.809
 as for size, here they are 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.370
 about here at a level like you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.910
 see not only beautiful but ergonomic 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.219
 pretty much related to others 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.660
 phone sizes to show 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 The difference here is for example, we have 2 fish 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.990
 x650 as you can see it is so relative 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.130
 plump width about them somewhere 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.350
 same here it weighs much more 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 there is such lightness here 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.900
 something like this if you can compare 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.360
 can also be compared to Nokia 5800 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.390
 but also completely different phones of course 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.060
 but nevertheless, here's our back 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.329
 it turns out thinner 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.049
 on the other side of the area 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:45.649
 that is, we have more screen plane 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.649
 Here are our sizes 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:56.520
 so it all looks well, and again with black 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 versions are all about here 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.479
 as you see here are different stubs 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.619
 headset plug is from the white version 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.920
 no here but this is the reason because 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.330
 first version of the phone in the rest 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 phone versions will be like this 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.959
 option it will perform without a stub 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.360
 that's about appearance 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.209
 light so let's say white or back and 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.209
 black dark and back
