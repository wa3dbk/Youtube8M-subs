00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
a pain the first thing is there's a lot

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.859 
a pain the first thing is there's a lot
of<00:00:18.150> small<00:00:18.690> plastic<00:00:19.230> Clips<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.750> holding<00:00:21.750> the

grill a nice - front trim parts on and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.460 
grill a nice - front trim parts on and
they<00:00:25.740> break<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.519> easily<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.019> person

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
they break really easily as the person

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890 
they break really easily as the person
who<00:00:28.619> owned<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.609> car<00:00:29.849> previously<00:00:30.420> obviously

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
who owned this car previously obviously

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.690 
who owned this car previously obviously
found<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.619> bother<00:00:31.859> replacing<00:00:32.399> any<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
found out then bother replacing any of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.620 
found out then bother replacing any of
them<00:00:32.820> okay<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.890> first<00:00:35.130> step<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> remove

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
them okay so the first step is remove

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
them okay so the first step is remove
the<00:00:36.809> grill<00:00:37.100> there<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.370> tabs<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> top

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the grill there are two tabs on the top

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.569 
the grill there are two tabs on the top
one<00:00:39.780> two<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> them<00:00:41.219> usually

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
one two so you can get to them usually

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
one two so you can get to them usually
with<00:00:41.700> along<00:00:41.940> those<00:00:42.149> pliers<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.350> clip

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
with along those pliers and just clip

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
with along those pliers and just clip
them<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.860> might<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.090> slid<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
them out might actually just slid out so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
them out might actually just slid out so
I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.260> being<00:00:46.469> pulled<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I think it's being pulled on and off a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.330 
I think it's being pulled on and off a
few<00:00:47.489> times<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> couple<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
few times and then there are a couple of

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
few times and then there are a couple of
tabs<00:00:50.520> signs<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> side<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
tabs signs is one on this side if you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.670 
tabs signs is one on this side if you
just<00:00:52.710> push<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:54.870> screwdriver<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
just push down with a screwdriver on the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
just push down with a screwdriver on the
top<00:00:56.239> it'll<00:00:57.239> slide<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.870> there's<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
top it'll slide right out there's one of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.619 
top it'll slide right out there's one of
those<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.859> each<00:00:58.890> side

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
those on each side

rack headlight mounting bolts there are
three<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> those<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.630> here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
three of those so there was one here

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
three of those so there was one here

there was one here and there was one up
here<00:01:40.790> that's<00:01:41.790> off<00:01:41.970> read<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> headlight<00:01:42.750> up

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
here that's off read the headlight up

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.160 
here that's off read the headlight up
quite<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.840> there's<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> lot<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
quite a bit so you know there's a lot of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
quite a bit so you know there's a lot of
play<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.500> left-hand<00:01:46.770> side<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> lot

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
play at the left-hand side and not a lot

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
play at the left-hand side and not a lot
at<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.720> thinking<00:01:48.930> what's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
at the right I was thinking what's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
at the right I was thinking what's
what's<00:01:50.009> still<00:01:50.310> holding<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.090> thought

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
what's still holding it and I thought

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.590 
what's still holding it and I thought
maybe<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.350> trim<00:01:52.619> piece<00:01:53.180> clip<00:01:54.180> here

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
maybe there the trim piece clip here

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120 
maybe there the trim piece clip here
goes<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.170> through<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> doesn't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
goes all the way through but it doesn't

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
quick release clips like you found on a

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
motorbike the top of the trim piece

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.940 
motorbike the top of the trim piece
there<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.590> looks<00:02:53.769> like<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
there so it looks like this and that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.589 
there so it looks like this and that
will<00:02:57.069> all<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.220> flush<00:02:57.849> obviously<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.450> can

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
will all be flush obviously and you can

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.270 
will all be flush obviously and you can
just<00:02:58.750> insert<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> screwdriver<00:02:59.530> into<00:02:59.950> one<00:03:00.159> of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
just insert a screwdriver into one of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.960 
just insert a screwdriver into one of
these<00:03:00.400> edges<00:03:00.909> and<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:02.170> usually<00:03:02.829> just<00:03:03.129> twist<00:03:03.849> it

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
these edges and I usually just twist it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.550 
these edges and I usually just twist it
to<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.090> side<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.599> leaves<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.079> center<00:03:05.319> pin

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
to the side so it leaves the center pin

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.949 
to the side so it leaves the center pin
out<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.950> then<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.400> should<00:03:06.609> collapse<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
out and then it should collapse and I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.149 
out and then it should collapse and I
like<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> rest<00:03:08.440> kind<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:10.090> then<00:03:10.269> obviously

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
like the rest kind and then obviously

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.080 
like the rest kind and then obviously
you<00:03:12.159> got<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> go<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.640> shop<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:12.940> buy<00:03:13.060> a
