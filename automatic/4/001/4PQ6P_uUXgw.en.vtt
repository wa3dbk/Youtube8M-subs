00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
an airplane or maybe you just need a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.900 
an airplane or maybe you just need a
ruggedized<00:00:33.020> case<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:34.400> don't<00:00:34.430> want<00:00:34.760> to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
ruggedized case and you don't want to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.110 
ruggedized case and you don't want to
carry<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.050> box<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.590> came<00:00:36.770> in<00:00:36.970> well<00:00:37.970> if

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
carry the box that it came in well if

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.460 
carry the box that it came in well if
you're<00:00:38.239> like<00:00:38.390> me<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.780> you've<00:00:38.900> performed<00:00:39.379> a

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
you're like me and you've performed a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.320 
you're like me and you've performed a
search<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:39.950> internet<00:00:40.090> you've<00:00:41.090> probably

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
search on the internet you've probably

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.490 
search on the internet you've probably
found<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.989> cases<00:00:43.180> made<00:00:44.180> for<00:00:44.540> DJI<00:00:44.900> phantom

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
found that cases made for DJI phantom

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.200 
found that cases made for DJI phantom
are<00:00:45.850> roughly<00:00:46.850> $100<00:00:47.690> maybe<00:00:47.930> $200<00:00:48.860> or<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.210> so

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
are roughly $100 maybe $200 or more so

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.920 
are roughly $100 maybe $200 or more so
what<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.390> found<00:00:50.720> is<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.080> way<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.290> do<00:00:51.589> it<00:00:51.620> for

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
what I found is a way to do it for

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.130 
what I found is a way to do it for
likely<00:00:53.930> comfortably<00:00:54.589> under<00:00:54.860> $50

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
likely comfortably under $50

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.130 
likely comfortably under $50
so<00:00:57.140> for<00:00:57.650> science<00:00:58.100> comparison<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.960> the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
so for science comparison this is the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.960 
so for science comparison this is the
box<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.269> my<00:01:02.269> DJI<00:01:02.780> phantom<00:01:03.470> 1.1.1<00:01:04.430> came<00:01:04.729> in

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
box that my DJI phantom 1.1.1 came in

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.350 
box that my DJI phantom 1.1.1 came in
and<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.770> can<00:01:06.920> see<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:07.370> case<00:01:07.640> I've<00:01:07.940> got<00:01:08.150> right

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
and you can see this case I've got right

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.289 
and you can see this case I've got right
here<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.720> sticker<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:10.460> case<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:11.030> right

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
here is sticker this case is right

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.880 
here is sticker this case is right
around<00:01:12.130> give<00:01:13.130> or<00:01:13.280> take<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.520> few<00:01:14.770> fractions<00:01:15.770> of

use and I'll show you one this case on

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.709 
use and I'll show you one this case on
the<00:01:59.359> inside<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:01.219> it's<00:02:01.609> lockable<00:02:02.210> too<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.479> don't

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
the inside and it's lockable too I don't

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.120 
the inside and it's lockable too I don't
know<00:02:02.899> if<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.109> can<00:02:03.259> lock<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:03.770> airline

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
know if you can lock it for airline

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.450 
know if you can lock it for airline
travel<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.020> lockable<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:07.369> know

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
travel but it is lockable so you know

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.320 
travel but it is lockable so you know
really<00:02:07.759> nice<00:02:07.909> latches<00:02:08.570> right<00:02:08.600> here<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
really nice latches right here and you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.500 
really nice latches right here and you
open<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> you've<00:02:13.819> got<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> really<00:02:14.240> nice

foam padding on the top and then on the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.960 
foam padding on the top and then on the
bottom<00:02:18.550> you've<00:02:19.550> got<00:02:19.730> little<00:02:19.970> square<00:02:20.360> pieces

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
bottom you've got little square pieces

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.570 
bottom you've got little square pieces
or<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> should<00:02:23.240> say<00:02:23.420> rectangular<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.460> can

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you can pull it out individually so what

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.690 
you can pull it out individually so what
I<00:02:32.540> did<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:34.010> got<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.650> DJI<00:02:37.040> phantom<00:02:37.580> now

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I did is I got the the DJI phantom now

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370 
I did is I got the the DJI phantom now
obviously<00:02:38.270> right<00:02:38.450> now<00:02:38.480> I've<00:02:38.720> got<00:02:38.870> my<00:02:38.900> GoPro

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
obviously right now I've got my GoPro

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.950 
obviously right now I've got my GoPro
connected<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.370> I've<00:02:41.270> got<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.600> landing

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
connected to it and I've got the landing

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.690 
connected to it and I've got the landing
gear<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.530> before<00:02:42.950> you're<00:02:43.130> ready<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.430> travel

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
gear on so before you're ready to travel

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.070 
gear on so before you're ready to travel
you<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:44.750> need<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.050> take<00:02:45.200> off<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.650> props<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
you would need to take off the props and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.940 
you would need to take off the props and
actually<00:02:48.080> if<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.260> wanted<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.830> could

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
actually if you wanted to you could

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.410 
actually if you wanted to you could
probably<00:02:49.190> cut<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.700> out<00:02:49.880> too<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.150> could<00:02:50.330> keep

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
probably cut this out too we could keep

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
probably cut this out too we could keep
the<00:02:50.600> props<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.290> prefer<00:02:51.650> not<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:53.270> when<00:02:53.390> I

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the props on I prefer not to but when I

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.210 
the props on I prefer not to but when I
travel<00:02:53.900> with<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.140> all<00:02:54.260> unscrew<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.980> self

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
travel with it all unscrew the self

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.320 
travel with it all unscrew the self
tightening<00:02:55.580> props<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.810> I'll<00:02:56.959> take<00:02:57.200> off<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
tightening props and I'll take off the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.850 
tightening props and I'll take off the
you<00:02:59.330> know<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.630> landing<00:03:00.200> gear<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.500> GoPro

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
you know the landing gear and the GoPro

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.460 
you know the landing gear and the GoPro
mount<00:03:01.070> but<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> demonstrate<00:03:02.000> how<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> did<00:03:03.170> this

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
mount but to demonstrate how I did this

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.660 
mount but to demonstrate how I did this
and<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.520> not<00:03:04.700> rocket<00:03:04.970> science

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and it's not rocket science

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.320 
and it's not rocket science
but<00:03:07.670> I'll<00:03:07.790> lay<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.640> Phantom<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.150> there

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
but I'll lay the the Phantom in there

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.790 
but I'll lay the the Phantom in there
and<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.480> try<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.050> positioned<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.709> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
and I try to get it positioned in the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.010 
and I try to get it positioned in the
middle<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.260> as<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.770> see<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:16.870> didn't<00:03:17.870> want

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
middle so as you can see I didn't want

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.420 
middle so as you can see I didn't want
to<00:03:18.110> take<00:03:18.260> out<00:03:18.410> too<00:03:18.590> much<00:03:18.739> foam<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.190> where<00:03:19.340> it

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
to take out too much foam to where it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.080 
to take out too much foam to where it
would<00:03:19.550> jiggle<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.070> took<00:03:22.370> out<00:03:22.550> enough<00:03:22.850> foam

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
would jiggle but I took out enough foam

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.640 
would jiggle but I took out enough foam
to<00:03:23.300> where<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.840> push<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.560> foam<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.010> side

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
to where I can push the foam to the side

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.740 
to where I can push the foam to the side
and<00:03:27.650> gently<00:03:28.130> press<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.950> really<00:03:31.190> mold

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
and gently press this in to really mold

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.289 
and gently press this in to really mold
securely<00:03:32.750> around<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.880> because<00:03:34.880> particularly

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
securely around it because particularly

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.789 
securely around it because particularly
for<00:03:35.630> air<00:03:35.750> travel<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.290> don't<00:03:36.440> want<00:03:36.590> something

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
for air travel you don't want something

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.180 
for air travel you don't want something
that's<00:03:37.010> going<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.160> jiggle<00:03:37.549> random<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.070> you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that's going to jiggle random so as you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.550 
that's going to jiggle random so as you
can<00:03:40.310> see<00:03:40.370> here<00:03:40.790> once<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.330> take<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.230> landing

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
can see here once I take the landing

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.620 
can see here once I take the landing
gear<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.799> GoPro<00:03:43.130> off<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.940> top<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.330> that<00:03:44.360> case

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
gear to GoPro off the top of that case

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.770 
gear to GoPro off the top of that case
will<00:03:44.870> close<00:03:45.019> without<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> problem

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
will close without a problem

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.970 
will close without a problem
what<00:03:47.780> I'm<00:03:47.870> also<00:03:48.049> going<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.620> do<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:49.420> put<00:03:50.420> these

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
what I'm also going to do is put these

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.390 
what I'm also going to do is put these
these<00:03:51.980> extra<00:03:52.400> self<00:03:52.670> tightening<00:03:52.970> propellers<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
these extra self tightening propellers I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.850 
these extra self tightening propellers I
can<00:03:55.400> simply<00:03:55.790> rest<00:03:56.030> them<00:03:56.299> right<00:03:56.570> there<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.140> for

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
can simply rest them right there and for

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.199 
can simply rest them right there and for
extra<00:03:58.190> batteries<00:04:00.400> what<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.430> can<00:04:01.700> do<00:04:01.820> for<00:04:02.060> them

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
extra batteries what I can do for them

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.870 
extra batteries what I can do for them
is<00:04:04.329> just<00:04:05.329> pull<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.190> pieces<00:04:07.190> select<00:04:07.700> right

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
is just pull out pieces select right

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.850 
is just pull out pieces select right
here<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.769> this<00:04:09.769> corner<00:04:10.040> area<00:04:11.410> I'm<00:04:12.410> pulling<00:04:12.769> out

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
here in this corner area I'm pulling out

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.060 
here in this corner area I'm pulling out
a<00:04:12.920> couple<00:04:13.700> pieces<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.180> foam<00:04:14.480> what<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.470> recommend

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
a couple pieces of foam what I recommend

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.880 
a couple pieces of foam what I recommend
doing<00:04:16.250> if<00:04:16.700> if<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.600> do<00:04:17.840> decide<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.380> pick<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
doing if if you do decide to pick up a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.640 
doing if if you do decide to pick up a
case<00:04:19.130> somewhere<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.640> this<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:21.200> doing<00:04:21.560> a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
case somewhere to this it's doing a

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.230 
case somewhere to this it's doing a
piece<00:04:21.890> at<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.190> time<00:04:22.460> because<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:22.850> don't<00:04:23.090> want

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
piece at a time because you don't want

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.570 
piece at a time because you don't want
to<00:04:23.300> get<00:04:23.390> too<00:04:23.570> much<00:04:24.910> because<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.030> want<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.270> have

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
to get too much because you want to have

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.170 
to get too much because you want to have
you<00:04:28.580> want<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.910> be<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> snug<00:04:29.390> fit<00:04:29.419> so<00:04:30.169> I<00:04:31.180> just

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
you want it to be a snug fit so I just

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.390 
you want it to be a snug fit so I just
took<00:04:32.390> out<00:04:32.600> three<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.290> these<00:04:33.410> side-by-side

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
took out three of these side-by-side

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.950 
took out three of these side-by-side
you<00:04:35.000> can<00:04:35.180> see<00:04:35.419> how<00:04:36.340> narrow<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:37.970> in

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
you can see how narrow that is in

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.049 
you can see how narrow that is in
comparison<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:40.599> see

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:43.059 
comparison to that see

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.320 
comparison to that see
but<00:04:44.059> when<00:04:44.179> I<00:04:44.209> put<00:04:44.449> this<00:04:44.599> battery<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.199> there<00:04:46.330> it

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
but when I put this battery in there it

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.889 
but when I put this battery in there it
fits<00:04:47.599> it<00:04:47.809> like<00:04:47.959> a<00:04:47.989> glove<00:04:48.289> and<00:04:49.749> then<00:04:50.749> obviously

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:50.899 
fits it like a glove and then obviously

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:56.049 
fits it like a glove and then obviously
once<00:04:51.559> I<00:04:51.709> had<00:04:53.409> once<00:04:54.409> I<00:04:54.559> had<00:04:54.739> those<00:04:54.949> landing<00:04:55.399> legs

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:56.059 
once I had once I had those landing legs

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:06.219 
once I had once I had those landing legs
off<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.509> could<00:04:56.719> close<00:04:56.989> this<00:05:04.599> with<00:05:05.599> my<00:05:05.749> batteries

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
off I could close this with my batteries

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:13.919 
off I could close this with my batteries
in<00:05:06.409> there<00:05:08.619> so<00:05:09.849> you<00:05:10.849> know<00:05:10.939> just<00:05:11.119> a<00:05:11.300> good<00:05:11.479> way<00:05:11.689> to

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
screwdriver on the side so this way I've

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:21.309 
screwdriver on the side so this way I've
got<00:06:19.339> everything<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:19.999> would<00:06:20.179> need<00:06:20.289> except<00:06:21.289> for

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
my transmitter and that's that's the

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.139 
my transmitter and that's that's the
thing<00:06:28.009> that's<00:06:28.309> probably<00:06:28.489> not<00:06:28.729> going<00:06:28.909> to<00:06:28.969> fit

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.149 
thing that's probably not going to fit

probably<00:06:34.999> carry<00:06:35.449> it<00:06:35.659> in<00:06:35.809> a<00:06:35.899> backpack<00:06:36.139> or

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
probably carry it in a backpack or

probably carry it in a backpack or
another<00:06:38.029> thing<00:06:38.329> but<00:06:38.599> I<00:06:38.809> mean<00:06:39.529> this<00:06:39.709> obviously
