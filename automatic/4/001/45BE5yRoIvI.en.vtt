you bathe the different layers of them

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.160 
you bathe the different layers of them
so<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.160> here<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.509> set<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> cookies

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so what we have here is a set of cookies

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
so what we have here is a set of cookies
they<00:01:16.740> still<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.100> flour<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
they still have flour on them which is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.200 
they still have flour on them which is
perfectly<00:01:18.600> okay<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.820> we'll<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.000> able<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
perfectly okay and we'll be able to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
perfectly okay and we'll be able to
brush<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> flour<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:22.050> after<00:01:22.410> they're<00:01:22.560> baked

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
brush that flour off after they're baked

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.790 
brush that flour off after they're baked
I've<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.940> life-size<00:01:24.450> cookies<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.440> same

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
I've put life-size cookies on the same

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.790 
I've put life-size cookies on the same
sheet<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.850> cookies<00:01:27.600> bake<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.470> different

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
sheet because cookies bake at different

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.120 
sheet because cookies bake at different
temperatures<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.060> case<00:01:30.360> I'm<00:01:30.690> going<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
temperatures in this case I'm going to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.469 
temperatures in this case I'm going to
put<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.399> into<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.910> oven<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.950> 325<00:01:34.950> degrees

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
put these into the oven at 325 degrees

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
put these into the oven at 325 degrees
for<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.899> 6<00:01:37.530> minutes<00:01:37.709> then<00:01:38.369> I'll<00:01:38.490> check<00:01:38.759> them

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
for about 6 minutes then I'll check them

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.779 
for about 6 minutes then I'll check them
and<00:01:39.860> they're<00:01:40.860> probably<00:01:41.039> going<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.610> two

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
and they're probably going on in two

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.219 
and they're probably going on in two
minutes<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.569> I'll<00:01:42.690> bring<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:42.959> out<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
minutes and then I'll bring them out of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.719 
minutes and then I'll bring them out of
the<00:01:43.319> oven<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:44.220> goes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the oven here goes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.740 
the oven here goes
I<00:01:45.500> put<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.039> cookies<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.729> very<00:01:48.209> lowest

I put the cookies on the very lowest

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
I put the cookies on the very lowest
rack<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.500> couldn't<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:49.979> oven<00:01:50.340> take<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> look<00:01:51.119> at

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
rack I couldn't my oven take a look at

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.050 
rack I couldn't my oven take a look at
how<00:01:51.810> low<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.459> there<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.819> all

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
how low that is and how there is all

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.650 
how low that is and how there is all
this<00:01:54.420> room<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.349> so<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.390> and
