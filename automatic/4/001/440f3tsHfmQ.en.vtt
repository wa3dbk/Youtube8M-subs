00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
you wake up the iPod it will always show
the<00:01:05.280> clock<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.119> also<00:01:06.240> change<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> clock

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the clock you can also change the clock

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620

face<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.460> black<00:01:08.939> clock<00:01:09.330> face

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
face so if you want the black clock face

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300 
face so if you want the black clock face
you'll<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> black<00:01:10.799> instead<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you'll get the black instead of the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.810 
you'll get the black instead of the
white

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
white

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
white
so<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.689> turn<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.610> turn<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> back

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so now if I turn this off turn it back

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
so now if I turn this off turn it back
on<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> clock<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.100> course<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.580> will

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
on we have the clock of course it will

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
on we have the clock of course it will
go<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.119> after<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> period<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> inactivity<00:01:19.310> now

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
go off after a period of inactivity now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
go off after a period of inactivity now

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
once you have your iPod Nano configure

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
once you have your iPod Nano configure
you'll<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.409> need<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> attach<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> an

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you'll just need to attach this to an

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
you'll just need to attach this to an
armband<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.509> sure<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:24.990> products

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
armband I'm sure there will be products

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.840 
armband I'm sure there will be products
that<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that will do this but for now I'm just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
that will do this but for now I'm just
gonna<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> backwards<00:01:27.840> watch<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.470> attach<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
gonna use a backwards watch to attach it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.090 
gonna use a backwards watch to attach it
to<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> clip<00:01:31.100> slide

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to so you can just use the clip slide

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.620 
to so you can just use the clip slide
the<00:01:32.400> sign<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> have

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the sign and there we go we kind of have

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
the sign and there we go we kind of have
an<00:01:39.750> idea<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.229> how<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> might<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
an idea of how it might look and this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
an idea of how it might look and this
this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> leather<00:01:42.659> strap<00:01:43.079> watch<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.799> it's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this is a leather strap watch so it's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.100 
this is a leather strap watch so it's
