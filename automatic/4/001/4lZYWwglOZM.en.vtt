00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the tackling the terrorist project was

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.099 
the tackling the terrorist project was
an<00:00:16.230> opportunity<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> could

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
an opportunity to see how you could

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.529 
an opportunity to see how you could
bring<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.920> group<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> people<00:00:20.550> together<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.150> do

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bring a group of people together to do

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.830 
bring a group of people together to do
an<00:00:22.170> external<00:00:22.859> wall<00:00:23.039> insulation<00:00:23.519> project<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
an external wall insulation project and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.570 
an external wall insulation project and
to<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.380> there<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.590> any<00:00:25.710> cost<00:00:26.099> savings

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to see if there are any cost savings

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370 
to see if there are any cost savings
that<00:00:26.730> could<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> made<00:00:27.240> whether<00:00:28.050> there<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.289> any

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that could be made whether there are any

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.410 
that could be made whether there are any
social<00:00:28.920> issues<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.429> went<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.210> it

social issues that went with it and it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.840 
social issues that went with it and it
was<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.779> looking<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:32.309> early

solid wall insulation project is that if

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
solid wall insulation project is that if
you<00:00:54.870> were<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> single<00:00:55.800> house

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you were to do it in a single house

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
you were to do it in a single house
while<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.149> different<00:00:57.899> neighbors

might<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.649> different<00:00:59.039> products<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.579> there

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
might use different products so there

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
might use different products so there
might<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> different<00:01:00.300> thicknesses<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> then

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
might be different thicknesses and then

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
might be different thicknesses and then
you<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.890> joint<00:01:02.190> problems<00:01:02.780> potential<00:01:03.780> joint

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you have joint problems potential joint

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.450 
you have joint problems potential joint

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
problems where you could get water

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
problems where you could get water
ingress<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.299> you've<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.140> air<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> come

in or out which makes the insulation not
as<00:01:10.799> good<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.540> go

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
as good as when you do it all in one go

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.929 
as good as when you do it all in one go
and<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.740> from<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.010> aesthetic<00:01:14.159> point<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and actually from an aesthetic point of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.260 
and actually from an aesthetic point of
view<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.810> probably<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:16.979> better

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.940 

projects<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.840> providers<00:01:22.470> work<00:01:22.650> for

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
projects like that do providers work for

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
projects like that do providers work for
local<00:01:23.070> people<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.820> used<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> local

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
local people and we used a lot of local

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
local people and we used a lot of local
people<00:01:25.580> all<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:26.939> neighbors<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.540> got

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
people all of our neighbors actually got

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
people all of our neighbors actually got
really<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.189> spend<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.939> each

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
really well they do spend time with each

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
really well they do spend time with each
other<00:01:30.240> they've<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:30.509> children<00:01:30.900> around<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
other they've got children around a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
other they've got children around a
similar<00:01:31.530> age<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.979> play<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> back<00:01:32.610> garden

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
similar age that play in the back garden

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
similar age that play in the back garden
so<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:34.110> were<00:01:34.320> very<00:01:34.470> lucky<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> people<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
so we were very lucky with the people we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
so we were very lucky with the people we
got<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.200> haven't<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.590> neighbors

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
got but if you haven't got neighbors

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
got but if you haven't got neighbors
that<00:01:38.220> speak<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> each<00:01:38.790> other<00:01:38.970> maybe<00:01:39.720> don't

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that speak to each other maybe don't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.679 
that speak to each other maybe don't
consider<00:01:40.650> using<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.729> multi<00:01:42.210> property

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
consider using them for a multi property

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.780 
consider using them for a multi property
