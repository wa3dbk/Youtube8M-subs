00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
next year but I really think that ever

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.420 
next year but I really think that ever
since<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:35.990> lost<00:04:36.169> loyalist<00:04:36.800> field<00:04:37.010> we<00:04:37.190> really

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
since we lost loyalist field we really

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.730 
since we lost loyalist field we really
you<00:04:37.970> know<00:04:38.120> we<00:04:38.360> lost<00:04:38.510> by<00:04:38.720> one<00:04:38.930> point<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.410> then

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
you know we lost by one point and then

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.110 
you know we lost by one point and then
you<00:04:40.040> know<00:04:40.160> we're<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.520> weight<00:04:40.669> room<00:04:40.699> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
you know we're in the weight room and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.550 
you know we're in the weight room and
the<00:04:41.180> offseason<00:04:41.660> would<00:04:41.810> say<00:04:41.960> we<00:04:42.110> lost<00:04:42.290> by<00:04:42.410> one

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
the offseason would say we lost by one

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.810 
the offseason would say we lost by one
point<00:04:42.590> that's<00:04:43.010> one<00:04:43.130> more<00:04:43.280> rep<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.610> we<00:04:43.699> can

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
point that's one more rep that we can

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.340 
point that's one more rep that we can
push<00:04:44.000> out<00:04:44.210> that's<00:04:44.419> one<00:04:44.570> more<00:04:44.720> set<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.199> can

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
push out that's one more set that we can

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.560 
push out that's one more set that we can
do<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:46.639> know<00:04:46.699> I<00:04:46.790> think<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.240> sky<00:04:47.419> is<00:04:47.449> the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
do and you know I think the sky is the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.030 
do and you know I think the sky is the
limit<00:04:47.660> for<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.050> team<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.320> really<00:04:48.650> think<00:04:48.830> I

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
limit for this team I really think I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040 
limit for this team I really think I
truly<00:04:49.400> believe<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.060> we<00:04:50.600> have<00:04:50.630> something

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
truly believe that we have something

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.360 
truly believe that we have something
special<00:04:51.199> here<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.680> we<00:04:51.770> haven't<00:04:52.010> had<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.160> past

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
special here that we haven't had in past

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.860 
special here that we haven't had in past
years<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.360> know<00:04:53.449> hopefully<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.840> brings

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870
