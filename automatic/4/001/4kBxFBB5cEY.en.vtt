00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.130
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 found for a video a little 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.930
 information of what happened these 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 last time with go pro so like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.660
 you could see it on the networks 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.800
 social ones so those who have not seen it's 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.040
 for that this video is made for 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.720
 I already talked about the new coop 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 roque is out yesterday so it's the gopro 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.540
 more heroes so just you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.540
 explain after this case there then we go 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.430
 talk about them jump so I like it's a 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.910
 go pro accessory that allows to do 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 videos or 360 photos and finally the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 drone gopro so to start we're going 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 talk about this new camera gopro 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 heroes more then there frankly they have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.660
 is strong because we have something 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 really not bad for a camera so 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 already at the 8 megapixel of two wings to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.979
 the LCD screen that she did not have before 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.250
 on the classic aero and then she 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 can shoot in 1080p 60 frames second 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.310
 it is 127 g al a little bit 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.200
 heavier than the aero then we have the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 function has light so be told the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.840
 function of the markers we have the function 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.759
 quick capture like on the aero 4 so that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 so it's really not bad we have the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.060
 super view mode the goal that opens up to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.049
 2.8 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have integrated microphone and mono we have a port 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.000
 for external micro autonomy 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.520
 estimated at 2 hours in full HD 60 images 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 per second without him of course 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.780
 when it was turned on because yes 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 she embarks u18 girl on at 1:45 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.049
 then we also had bluetooth for 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.840
 connect the gopro to a mobile terminal 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.430
 or a smart remote terminal so 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.689
 really not bad this little camera I 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.890
 find I pass you the photos at the same 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.219
 time as you can see 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 so the price I spoke to you immediately 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.489
 it is about 3 129 euros including 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.920
 finding that can have in France because 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.299
 that good she announced at 299 dollars this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.280
 which normally would represent little 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.430
 almost 179 euros 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.410
 and there we have 329 euros so we get 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.910
 largely well ripped off and that's not it 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.510
 the fault of go pro is the fault of the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.190
 France so then I find that she 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 is not bad except that it is actually 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.130
 she is not very far from the gopro 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.070
 hero iv silver which is located 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.920
 currently at 30 euros more expensive so 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.470
 basically 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.970
 you have to choose your camera in everything 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.319
 case for 8 megapixel etc 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.910
 I find it really not bad she is 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.800
 water resistant to 40 meters it must be 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 specify 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.430
 so personally I find that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.660
 this range is rather interesting there 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.220
 should downright suppress the hero 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.970
 classic dropped a little the price of that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.980
 ci and keep this one a hero iii more 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.700
 I would say inherent to the four blocks me 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.560
 and me that's what I see 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.730
 personally after eighteen months in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.440
 the comments you what you see 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.060
 but otherwise she is there she is really 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.050
 not bad she offers a lot of things 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.500
 in addition she did not have before 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.640
 especially the lcd screen so the lcd screen by 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.810
 against they say not autonomy but 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.040
 I think that although we come down to a 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.290
 hour and a half when it is activated 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.790
 so that's usable underwater and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.220
 it's really not bad 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.410
 then we went to number two 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.180
 so this is the famous jump accessory 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.180
 so john what is it watching 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.280
 it is on the screen this sphere then there was 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.580
 two versions good the official version 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.319
 it is this one that I thought on the screen 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.940
 it is precisely on the plateau so me 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.790
 I prefer to stick to this information 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.980
 there look good we have a kind of 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.870
 squares and we're on it actually there are 6 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.690
 go pro and his six co prove everything 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.940
 simply be connected together by hand 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.400
 how to say an algorithm that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.220
 allows to put it together the flow of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.660
 six cameras and in the end we have an image 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.920
 spherical unified in six cases so that's 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.970
 an information lot because 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.829
 it's actually a French company 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.120
 who created these and that was bought back 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.329
 by go causes it's fine for the 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.640
 la France 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.140
 besides this is actually if you 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.730
 do you want to be able to film 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.549
 videos and making tablecloths knows 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.980
 to make 360 photos and then the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.790
 just read on cases what 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.289
 you know 360 degrees like we can 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.549
 see on the internet right now and 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.940
 start a little out 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.590
 so that to allow to start there 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.640
 in virtual reality if you 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.100
 prefer dhr we will be able to watch 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.860
 so here we can they are compatible 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 also with youtube 360 ​​on smartphone and 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.130
 on pc so these rooms benefits but 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.500
 also the reality helmets as I 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.240
 said the price of the accessory in 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.680
 France it was sold 600 euros but it 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.970
 would surprise me that it is sold 600 euros 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.169
 when it was redeemed by what you said 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.669
 will go up more in the 1000 euros I 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.480
 think but we'll see but in any case 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.240
 must already see if 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.740
 proulx and rob blake and it hurts 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.700
 then the second the very first 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.830
 rumor that had it's exactly 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.780
 this photo so if this photo if I 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.000
 do not think so much is about 16 go 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.580
 pro on is 16 go pro who would do the same 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.170
 thing but I have not I'm not sure 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.640
 that this is the real social reason 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.230
 we have the picture we saw while 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.310
 the time on the set in the 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.610
 google presentation and conference 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.760
 and then in last news we have 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.870
 the most important info that all the 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.930
 world was waiting for is that your 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.760
 about doing a drone well yes neither 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.650
 kouman what he did is that everything 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.330
 he simply told the public 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.320
 so I do not have I have not managed to 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.180
 find the video but he said at 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.250
 public is what you want the drone 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.480
 what did you do to yourself is this 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.820
 that you think there will be a drone 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.680
 gopro he said ok go ok then you 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.390
 to do the we will not go pro is basically it 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.690
 announced that she would come out the 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.830
 first quarter of 2016 so that's it 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.690
 do not know how it's going 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.640
 and we will not be if we will not be if it will be 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.170
 better than already or not if there are 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.090
 stabilizers etc for now we do not 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.920
 know nothing at all there really said that 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.250
 just it will be available at first 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.760
 quarter 2007 even so here we have more 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.790
 than wait 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.440
 in any case do you wish 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.690
 wait to buy a gopro drone 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.680
 also you can buy following jean 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.630
 it's up to you to choose 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.610
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.140
 will have pleased here is the little information 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.710
 that there have been drifts minutes to them 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.710
 beat
