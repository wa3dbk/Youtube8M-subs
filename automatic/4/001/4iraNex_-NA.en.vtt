00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.179
 You can practically say that internet pom key paper and trade 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.239
 electronic 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.510
 is gaining every day 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.880
 exposition 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 let's say 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 the difference was transacted there is no transaction 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.030
 I believe that it is not really very important to be transacted disappointment 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.370
 the question 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.430
 fundamentally, they did not expect electronic transaction to be 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.500
 electronic transaction the issue 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 essien and transaction or not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.630
 be physical electronic and really that transaction there is a percentage 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.300
 huge in tourism moves and through the internet and without a doubt that will go 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.480
 more to say what is the role of electronic commerce without a doubt 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.970
 relevant in today's world 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.810
 and a tourist company 1 can not say to face this world without a 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.060
 positioning 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.560
 in the internet world 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.219
 and the internet world when one is really well positioned the top 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.180
 is when you allow the transaction 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.410
 so let's say that if one wants 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.960
 let's say that you are well positioned in this world, because you need without a doubt 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 in generating transactions 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.320
 I do not think so 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.540
 a touristic company at the moment dv 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.630
 your positioning 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.800
 very large worlds people move a different way 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.160
 so the first thing you should do without a doubt is to have a 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.540
 Moscow functionality we send cheerful 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.630
 a functionality 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.180
 we look at what is used is to say that people 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 do not have to be an expert to navigate the paid concur 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 a few percent higher and your study will be done 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.370
 It is also very important 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.039
 that web is a web 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.900
 the state pact is to say 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.899
 that really on this website is reached 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.189
 in the last house 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.649
 that is not the same website year after year 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.539
 something really important that that web 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.809
 offer transactionality 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.319
 and these the pair of the web but not enough in today's world one should 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.979
 also be in the 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.469
 let's say intermediaries 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.169
 increasingly important 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.549
 and without a doubt 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.369
 it must be so well positioned 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.789
 the ear markets 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.939
 ep a good positioning on the internet requires a plan 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.409
 and demands yes no 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.299
 you doubt a real decision of the company that this is one of your channels 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.299
 fundamental 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.679
 in these very easy 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.089
 must respond 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.649
 percent someone thinks 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.139
 in which your child uses computers or video consoles or the mobile 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 It is punctual poker and he will use it every day 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.009
 bush I am convinced my son directs them all his life 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.660
 If you do not have the possibility 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.470
 p undoubtedly we join but it is an opportunity to be norme 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.799
 for any company 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.009
 to approach 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.009
 to the large mass of customers that will be a technological mass 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.319
 the fundamental idea is that the path is continuous innovation 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.329
 and each continuous innovation is reached exclusively at this time 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.439
 scu is that there may well be very smart that I somewhere else but the 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.189
 most of the people we have to get through the intensive use of the 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.149
 technology 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.999
 and of continuing education 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.979
 and in that way I think 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.499
 that there are many, many, many more chances of winning 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:46.119
 that in others
