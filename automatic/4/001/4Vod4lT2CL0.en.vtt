as<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.690> I've<00:00:19.020> already<00:00:19.170> started<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
as you can see I've already started the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890 
as you can see I've already started the
process<00:00:21.350> but<00:00:22.350> I've<00:00:22.500> taken<00:00:23.630> plaster<00:00:24.630> patcher

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
process but I've taken plaster patcher

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
process but I've taken plaster patcher
and<00:00:25.670> layered<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:27.930> elite<00:00:28.260> head<00:00:28.550> now

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and layered it up on my elite head now

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.040 
and layered it up on my elite head now
what<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
what that's going to do is it's going to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
what that's going to do is it's going to
allow<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> actually<00:00:33.800> are<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
allow me to actually are about the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
allow me to actually are about the
details<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> sandpaper<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
details with the sandpaper and what that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.420 
details with the sandpaper and what that
will<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.620> give<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
will do is it will give it more of a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
will do is it will give it more of a
fleshy<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> organic<00:00:43.020> feel<00:00:43.320> instead<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.370> using

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fleshy and organic feel instead of using

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
fleshy and organic feel instead of using
a<00:00:45.329> dremel<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:47.000> relying<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> initial<00:00:49.050> shape

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
a dremel or relying on the initial shape

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.860 
a dremel or relying on the initial shape
which<00:00:49.620> y'all<00:00:49.860> saw<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.789> blocky<00:00:51.120> what

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
which y'all saw was really blocky what

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.529 
which y'all saw was really blocky what
I'm<00:00:51.989> doing<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:52.770> taken<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.489> 120<00:00:54.390> grit

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
I'm doing is I've taken a 120 grit

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
I'm doing is I've taken a 120 grit
sandpaper<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.699> trying<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
sandpaper I'm actually just trying to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.990 
sandpaper I'm actually just trying to
follow<00:00:57.649> what<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
follow what I would think would be the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
follow what I would think would be the
natural<00:01:00.210> edges<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
natural edges you as you can see the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.429 
natural edges you as you can see the
fans<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.780> easily<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:06.260> what<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.409> doing

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
fans off really easily so what I'm doing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.660 
fans off really easily so what I'm doing
is<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.100> only<00:01:08.159> making<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.909> crews<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:10.670> trying

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
is not only making it crews from trying

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.870 
is not only making it crews from trying
to<00:01:11.820> push<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.869> take<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.159> little

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to push in and take off just a little

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.960 
to push in and take off just a little
excess<00:01:15.780> where<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.369> skin<00:01:17.729> would

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
excess where I think this the skin would

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.800 
excess where I think this the skin would
naturally<00:01:18.720> creep<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.600> basing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
naturally creep in now what I'm basing

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
naturally creep in now what I'm basing
this<00:01:22.200> top<00:01:22.530> part<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.060> legendary
