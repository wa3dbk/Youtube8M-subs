00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.259
 there are six different degrees to 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.729
 trip 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.830
 many travelers experience each 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.280
 day the first five but few of 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.600
 they touched the 6th I long 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.490
 dreamed of leaving to escape a 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.560
 monotonous daily but I have never 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.119
 made 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.619
 until the day I met voluntarily 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.210
 it's always like that the first 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.840
 moments of a relaxing journey in 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 mighty nature tapas like a rise of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 lsd it's calm it's normal 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 I quickly realized that the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.359
 destination mattered little that counts 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 the road that is not what will be in 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.880
 three months so 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.260
 if they're deadline art done 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.150
 those who bet after the hearing 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.860
 hashim thaÃ§i 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.970
 greg opened the doors of a world where 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.660
 every encounter is the beginning 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.660
 of a new life 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.210
 a world where every night carries high our 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 dreams of days to come and where time 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 only has value 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.869
 starts from something 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.840
 sixth trip guti that does not have 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840
 bus has passed 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:45.640
 you surely have to taste the east 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.640
 heroin is part of the opium fermin 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.620
 we are all looking for a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 ideal or a mystical power greg has 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.560
 found his in the exaltation of the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.730
 movement why am I still alive 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.330
 in front of you because I have 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.330
 the impression of writing there because never 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.110
 we touch we move we are in 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.440
 the excitement more harmony 12 all 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.440
 simply 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:39.890
 he reached 2.7 and gothard 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.360
 stop the slaughter I use it myself I 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.280
 have a screw a circus 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.270
 I want each departure is a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.140
 birth 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.569
 like every movement is a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.790
 breathing 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.469
 the beating heart I do not perceive their most 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.510
 that the pulsation of a life that escapes me 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.980
 second after second to drift to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.219
 a stranger I'm looking for since his 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.219
 beginning 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.749
 and if by the greatest of chances and 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.319
 degree so this morning on the way that 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.909
 is for me 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.329
 I would then have nothing left to 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.329
 blame 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.710
 I expect different movies on 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.280
 the absolute where young people who surf 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.450
 trip either that makes no sense it's at 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.450
 me that you wait 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.370
 but
