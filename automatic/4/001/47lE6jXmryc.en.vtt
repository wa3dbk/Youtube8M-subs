Sigma are not art lens failures or their
signal<00:01:00.960> lens<00:01:01.109> failures<00:01:01.879> um<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.570> have

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
signal lens failures um they don't have

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.380 
signal lens failures um they don't have
forward<00:01:04.229> compatibility<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
forward compatibility they do up to a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
many 20-year old nick wars are out there

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
many 20-year old nick wars are out there
still<00:01:12.030> cranking<00:01:12.479> hot<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> heavy<00:01:13.100> nearly<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
still cranking hot and heavy nearly a
hundred<00:01:14.340> percent<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:15.420> many

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hundred percent you know how many

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
hundred percent you know how many
twenty-year-old<00:01:16.200> signals<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.770> still<00:01:16.979> out

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
twenty-year-old signals are still out

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.060 
twenty-year-old signals are still out
there<00:01:17.130> cranking<00:01:17.729> none<00:01:18.350> well<00:01:19.350> let's<00:01:19.710> say<00:01:19.890> one

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there cranking none well let's say one

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.469 
there cranking none well let's say one
or<00:01:20.189> two<00:01:20.220> percent<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:23.180> started<00:01:24.180> getting<00:01:24.390> all

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
or two percent so I started getting all

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
or two percent so I started getting all
these<00:01:24.630> emails<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.590> folks<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:26.130> yeah<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
these emails from you folks about yeah I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.749 
these emails from you folks about yeah I
had<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> expensive<00:01:28.259> art<00:01:28.470> lens<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.579> day

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
had this expensive art lens and one day

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.740 
had this expensive art lens and one day
the<00:01:29.909> motor<00:01:30.119> burned<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.189> two<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.520> were

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
the motor burned out or two of them were

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.730 
the motor burned out or two of them were
our<00:01:33.950> aperture<00:01:34.970> crashes<00:01:35.970> were<00:01:36.740> especially

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
our aperture crashes were especially

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
our aperture crashes were especially
shooting<00:01:38.189> attendant<00:01:38.610> continuous<00:01:39.119> high<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
shooting attendant continuous high the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
shooting attendant continuous high the
tolerances<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.409> low<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> aperture

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
tolerances are low on the aperture

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
tolerances are low on the aperture
blades<00:01:41.579> will<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> they'll<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.079> crash

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
blades will do is they'll actually crash

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.539 
blades will do is they'll actually crash
and<00:01:43.799> fold<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.250> themselves<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.549> kind

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and fold on themselves it's it's a kind

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
and fold on themselves it's it's a kind
of<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.729> yeah<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.600> what's<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
of like yeah I don't know what's that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.929 
of like yeah I don't know what's that
compare<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.100> junk<00:01:50.340> stuck<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> your

Sigma<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.370> was<00:02:13.459> actually<00:02:13.819> more<00:02:14.060> than<00:02:14.239> if<00:02:14.330> it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
Sigma it was actually more than if it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.690 
Sigma it was actually more than if it
was<00:02:14.690> even<00:02:14.810> asking<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.440> emails<00:02:16.010> about<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
was even asking for emails about the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.120 
was even asking for emails about the
dead<00:02:17.060> Sigma<00:02:17.780> heart<00:02:17.959> lenses<00:02:18.470> but<00:02:21.130> moreover

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
dead Sigma heart lenses but moreover

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.839 
dead Sigma heart lenses but moreover
rolled<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.790> than<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.060> actually<00:02:23.239> expected<00:02:23.770> and

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
