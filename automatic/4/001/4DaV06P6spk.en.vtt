stocks<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.259> stand<00:02:10.530> even<00:02:11.159> if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> don't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
stocks and you stand even if you don't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.069 
stocks and you stand even if you don't
use<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.209> they<00:02:12.329> just<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.689> of<00:02:12.719> take<00:02:12.959> up

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
use them so they just kind of take up

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.580 
use them so they just kind of take up
your<00:02:13.230> memory<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.249> you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.489> it's<00:02:14.790> whatever

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
here is also pretty neat and I really

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.690 
here is also pretty neat and I really
like<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.590> also<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> download<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.580> music

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
so you can listen to it offline and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.880 
so you can listen to it offline and
without<00:02:59.760> Wi-Fi<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.050> went<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.410> offline

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
without Wi-Fi so here I went on offline

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.270 
without Wi-Fi so here I went on offline
mode<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.630> some<00:03:03.840> songs<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.680> some

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
mode and I have some songs and some

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
mode and I have some songs and some
playlists<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.180> listen<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:07.010> without

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
playlists that I can listen to without

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.130 
playlists that I can listen to without
Wi-Fi<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:08.850> i<00:03:08.970> think<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.239> really<00:03:09.510> cool<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
Wi-Fi which i think is really cool and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.410 
Wi-Fi which i think is really cool and
then<00:03:10.709> once<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.010> turn<00:03:11.220> off<00:03:11.430> offline<00:03:12.030> mode<00:03:12.209> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
then once you turn off offline mode and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
then once you turn off offline mode and

stuff I make a lot of playlists and my
playlist<00:03:23.579> names<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:24.090> really<00:03:24.750> really<00:03:24.930> lame

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
playlist names are really really lame

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.229 
playlist names are really really lame
and<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.100> here<00:03:26.250> I'm<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.519> showing<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.880> how<00:03:27.209> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
and so here I'm just showing you how to

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.020 
and so here I'm just showing you how to
make<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.049> playlist<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.620> pretty<00:03:28.799> easy<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.400> I

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
make a playlist it's pretty easy and I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.370 
make a playlist it's pretty easy and I
don't<00:03:30.180> know<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.930> love<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.140> app

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
don't know I just really love this app

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.319 
don't know I just really love this app
and<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:32.250> there's<00:03:32.519> quizlet<00:03:33.000> which<00:03:33.180> is

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
and then there's quizlet which is

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.360 
and then there's quizlet which is
basically<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.140> flash<00:03:34.440> cards<00:03:34.860> on<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> go

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
basically like a flash cards on the go

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.220 
basically like a flash cards on the go
and<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.390> super<00:03:36.810> convenient

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and I think it's super convenient

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
and I think it's super convenient

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
convenient it another thing I'll do when

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.170

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
down like the key points and stuff on

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.600 
down like the key points and stuff on
quizlet<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.019> then<00:03:55.200> I'll<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.610> quiz

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
quizlet and then I'll just have quiz

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.940 
quizlet and then I'll just have quiz
myself<00:03:57.030> using<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.230> know<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.739> feel

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
myself using that and it's I know I feel

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.440 
myself using that and it's I know I feel
like<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> really<00:03:59.459> effective<00:03:59.760> way<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.120> me

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
like it's a really effective way for me

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.810 
like it's a really effective way for me
to<00:04:00.480> memorize<00:04:01.070> important<00:04:02.070> things<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.610> notes

for<00:04:03.209> tests<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.019> would<00:04:04.170> definitely

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
for tests and I would definitely

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.530 
for tests and I would definitely
recommend<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.280> then<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> next<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.360> I

whatever and whatever setting you pick

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.939 
whatever and whatever setting you pick
is<00:04:40.030> how<00:04:40.240> you'll<00:04:40.419> feel<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.530> think<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:41.860> a

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
is how you'll feel and I think it's a

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.649 
is how you'll feel and I think it's a
really<00:04:41.979> cool<00:04:42.430> idea<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:42.909> I<00:04:43.300> don't<00:04:43.569> really

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
really cool idea but I don't really

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.659 
really cool idea but I don't really
think<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:44.050> works<00:04:44.259> for<00:04:44.500> me<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.280> guess<00:04:45.520> you

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
think it works for me so I guess you

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.219 
think it works for me so I guess you
should<00:04:45.849> check<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> out<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.509> see<00:04:46.569> if<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:47.050> works

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
should check it out and see if it works

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.800 
should check it out and see if it works
for<00:04:47.349> you<00:04:47.500> because<00:04:48.189> for<00:04:48.879> me<00:04:49.000> it's<00:04:49.449> not<00:04:49.599> really

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
for you because for me it's not really

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.149 
for you because for me it's not really
working<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.319> then<00:04:50.500> there's<00:04:50.740> schoolloop

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
working and then there's schoolloop

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.520 
working and then there's schoolloop
