are<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> materials<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.660> use<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> actually

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
are the materials that I use to actually

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
are the materials that I use to actually
make<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.890> espadrilles<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.910> my

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

video

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.080 

so<00:00:56.440> when<00:00:56.590> you<00:00:56.680> open<00:00:56.890> up<00:00:56.950> your<00:00:57.010> box<00:00:57.370> you'll<00:00:57.790> find

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
so when you open up your box you'll find

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.120 
so when you open up your box you'll find
that<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.750> have<00:00:58.990> your<00:00:59.140> instructions<00:00:59.560> inside

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
that you have your instructions inside

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.920 
that you have your instructions inside

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and if I'm watching the paper and they

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.690 
and if I'm watching the paper and they
think<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.650> your<00:01:05.920> passes<00:01:06.370> there

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
think that it is your passes there

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.550 
think that it is your passes there
aren't<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.090> many<00:01:07.150> instruction<00:01:08.050> teachers

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560
