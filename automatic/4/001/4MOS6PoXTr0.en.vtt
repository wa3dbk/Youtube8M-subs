 hello everyone with you everyday noob 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280
 and today we have an overview of the tank t-29 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.250
 armor forehead case is only 102 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.000
 millimeter and the lower part of the frontal part 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.660
 only 70 booking boards 76 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.380
 millimeters 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.020
 feed only 51 gorgeous branigan 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.950
 forehead towers as much as two hundred seventy nine 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 millimeters 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.380
 with armor mask thickness of armor 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.420
 approaching 400 ohm engine power 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.300
 800 horsepower 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.600
 maximum speed of 35 kilometers 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.610
 one -time damage 320 units 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 breaking one hundred ninety eight 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.210
 millimeters 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.670
 fire rate five twenty six 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 shots per minute 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 gd is 11 seconds 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.530
 a reduction of two point three seconds 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 042 scattering time can be 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 reduce by adding 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.780
 fan rammer and perk 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 martial brotherhood corners vertical 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 pickups from minus 10 to plus 15 degrees 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.800
 380 meter survey 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.890
 t29 is an american heavy tank 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 level seven on it or you learn 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.509
 play through the tower ie use 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.690
 hills and shelters or will be fast 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.700
 goes to the hangar t29 a few 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.160
 difficult to master if you canâ€™t 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.340
 play through the tower and suggests 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.740
 quite specific tactics namely 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.959
 excellent vertical alignment angles and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.240
 impenetrable forehead towers create 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.030
 opportunity for specific tactics 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.640
 heavy american tanks lies 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.190
 it is that the vulnerable body is hiding 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.500
 behind cover by the enemy is shown 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.050
 only the forehead of the turret punch which 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.750
 almost impossible if the opponent 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.120
 there is no way around you to destroy 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670
 and you do it without harm to yourself at all 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.930
 get a steel wall on t29 not 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.109
 is labor 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.510
 In general, when shooting in the forehead of the T29 tower, you can 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.510
 aim weak spots but do it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.069
 difficult for example observation devices though 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.859
 and are quite large 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.689
 on make it very rarely let me get 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.150
 on them at close range can 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.340
 only a tall tank is likely 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.230
 punch in small sections on the sides 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.540
 which undisguised mask guns hull 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.000
 tank hide or behind a variety of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.069
 objects or low folds 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.489
 terrain very good angles 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.650
 vertical pickup allows it to 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.230
 shooting from behind hills show only 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.599
 impenetrable forehead towers for example 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
 German and Soviet tanks often in 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.030
 such cases have to travel 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.379
 completely and be substituted for the shot 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.719
 maximum speed is 35 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.480
 kilometers per hour but approached her 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.760
 can only be on hard ground on soft 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.879
 soil t29 turns slowly 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.950
 crawling turtle as you can see t29 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.280
 somewhat dependent on locality and availability 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 on her shelters in open spaces 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.129
 t29 almost defenseless 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.629
 but if you shoot from behind cover 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.840
 shows only the forehead of the tower who put 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.479
 you will be very difficult to damage the bottleneck 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.729
 for good shelter t29 is capable of 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.879
 alone stop the rush of several 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.680
 opponents above the level still one-time 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.650
 damage of 320 units 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.689
 very weighty argument on the open 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.370
 places even with shelter 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.699
 restrain several opponents in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.470
 alone will not work t29 quickly 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.689
 prick the flanks and shoot in the side 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.780
 which are seamlessly stitched 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.639
 and tanks of the fifth level tank is very 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.109
 performs well in the clinch with 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.300
 other heavy tanks 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.759
 if you substitute for shots only 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.110
 impenetrable forehead tower high 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.320
 opponent with bad vertical angles 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.570
 pickups will not be able to lower the instrument to 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.530
 punch his body and will be forced 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.349
 shoot the tower 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.330
 but here is a low opponent on the example of Isa 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.720
 third, you can get into the clinch and 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.930
 break through 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.450
 body t29 is also not worth joining 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.669
 clinch with medium tanks if the opponent 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.310
 a little know how to play, he will spin 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.979
 t29 and shoot his defenseless karma 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.200
 and the board as a conclusion is worth 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.690
 say that t29 password on the battlefield 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.460
 able to work wonders to play it 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.830
 definitely worth it if you can 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.599
 to tank through the tower 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.590
 the next after 129 is heavy american 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:09.289
 tank level eight t32 is very similar to 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.419
 its predecessor is practically 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.690
 same booking only forehead case 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.000
 keeps hitting better the same engines and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.440
 guns so if you will be fine 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.539
 play t29 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.880
 you can do a lot of damage and 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:27.650
 transfer the victory to the team and to t32 on 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.779
 put all my likes on it 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.260
 subscribe to the channel write 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:35.529
 comments with you was a weekday noob all
