look like so in go we've got iron Ramsay

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
look like so in go we've got iron Ramsay
the<00:01:45.420> positions<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:45.990> absolutely<00:01:46.350> irrelevance

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the positions are absolutely irrelevance

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
the positions are absolutely irrelevance
but<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.159> Aaron<00:01:47.430> Ramsey<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.880> I'm

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but you can see Aaron Ramsey there I'm

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.310 
but you can see Aaron Ramsey there I'm
actually<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> little

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
actually going to do this one a little

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
actually going to do this one a little
bit<00:01:49.560> different<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> other<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.909> we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bit different to the other two now if we

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880 
bit different to the other two now if we
move<00:01:51.360> over<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.049> left<00:01:52.079> back<00:01:52.409> position<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
move over to the left back position so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
move over to the left back position so
he's<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.070> actually<00:01:53.220> next<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> Ramsey<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
he's not actually next to Ramsey we have

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 
he's not actually next to Ramsey we have
got<00:01:54.630> Luke<00:01:55.049> sure<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.130> guys<00:01:56.340> don't

necessarily look very similar at all to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.440 
necessarily look very similar at all to
be<00:01:59.100> honest<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.520> they<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.390> like

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
be honest because they don't look like

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
they've got a bit of a same haircut but

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
they've got a bit of a same haircut but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to show you guys and it is Luke
goblets<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.200> first<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.830> thought<00:02:11.069> he<00:02:11.250> looked

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
goblets now at first I thought he looked

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460 
goblets now at first I thought he looked
like<00:02:11.520> Luke<00:02:11.819> Shaw<00:02:12.060> secondly<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> thought

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
like Luke Shaw secondly I thought

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.630 
like Luke Shaw secondly I thought
look<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.710> Aaron<00:02:14.040> Ramsey<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.610> I

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
look like Aaron Ramsey and then I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.730 
look like Aaron Ramsey and then I
realized<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.720> look<00:02:15.900> sure<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.440> Aaron

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
realized if we look sure and Aaron

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.680 
realized if we look sure and Aaron
Ramsey<00:02:16.950> could<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> baby<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.210> their<00:02:18.420> love

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
Ramsey could have a baby and their love

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.120 
Ramsey could have a baby and their love
child<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:19.200> whatever<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> want<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> call<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
child or whatever you want to call it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.690 
child or whatever you want to call it
would<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.940> Luke<00:02:21.600> God<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.410> he<00:02:22.680> looks<00:02:22.980> crazy

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
would be Luke God but he looks crazy

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700 
would be Luke God but he looks crazy
like<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.210> pair<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.510> them<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.810> somehow<00:02:25.350> had

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
like the pair of them if somehow had

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.220 
like the pair of them if somehow had

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.850 
looks like he's got a slightly bigger
head<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.020> think<00:05:07.200> it's<00:05:07.320> literally<00:05:07.620> just<00:05:07.650> the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
head but I think it's literally just the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.800 
head but I think it's literally just the
cameras<00:05:08.220> closer<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.730> him<00:05:08.820> because<00:05:09.090> apart<00:05:09.690> from

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
cameras closer to him because apart from

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.630 
cameras closer to him because apart from
that<00:05:09.990> they<00:05:10.230> look<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.800> brothers<00:05:11.220> basically

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
that they look like brothers basically

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.760 
that they look like brothers basically
it<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:11.940> ridiculous<00:05:12.900> how<00:05:13.020> similar<00:05:13.260> these<00:05:13.500> guys

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
it is ridiculous how similar these guys

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.280 
it is ridiculous how similar these guys
look<00:05:14.010> others<00:05:14.760> just<00:05:15.450> basically<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.050> theme<00:05:16.260> of

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
look others just basically the theme of

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.930 
look others just basically the theme of
this<00:05:16.560> squad<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:16.920> is<00:05:17.040> crazy<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.520> don't<00:05:17.640> know<00:05:17.820> if

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
this squad that is crazy I don't know if

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.580 
this squad that is crazy I don't know if
it's<00:05:18.090> because<00:05:18.240> II<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.600> use<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.960> same<00:05:19.080> cameraman

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
it's because II I use the same cameraman

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.930 
it's because II I use the same cameraman
or<00:05:19.680> something<00:05:19.919> like<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.490> he<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.760> seems

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
or something like that and he just seems

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.159 
or something like that and he just seems
to<00:05:21.060> make<00:05:21.150> people<00:05:21.419> look<00:05:21.600> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:22.020> similar

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
to make people look kind of similar

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.900 
to make people look kind of similar
really<00:05:22.710> really<00:05:22.980> similar<00:05:23.160> but<00:05:23.730> it<00:05:23.820> is

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
really really similar but it is

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.510 
really really similar but it is
absolutely<00:05:24.120> mental<00:05:24.750> how<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:25.470> clones<00:05:26.250> these

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
absolutely mental how just clones these

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040 
absolutely mental how just clones these
guys<00:05:26.730> basically<00:05:26.970> look<00:05:27.330> like<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.840> owned

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.170 
guys basically look like it is owned
real<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:28.950> that<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.669> going<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:29.850> be<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.000> end<00:05:30.120> of
