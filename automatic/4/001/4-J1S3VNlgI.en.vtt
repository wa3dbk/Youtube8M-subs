all right this is just a quick get oh
look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:05.930> using<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.080> rep<00:00:07.319> defogger<00:00:08.360> to<00:00:10.070> go

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
look at my using my rep defogger to go

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.549 
look at my using my rep defogger to go
across<00:00:11.309> three<00:00:11.820> tanks<00:00:12.240> instead<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.290> I

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
across three tanks instead of this one I

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.460 
across three tanks instead of this one I
found<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.429> perfect<00:00:14.719> will<00:00:15.719> transition<00:00:16.109> put

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
found the perfect will transition put

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
found the perfect will transition put
each<00:00:16.740> span<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.340> amount<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:19.340> log<00:00:20.340> because

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
each span to the amount of log because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820 
each span to the amount of log because
if<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> turn<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.600> high<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.410> comes<00:00:22.680> out

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
if you turn on high it all comes out

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.040 
if you turn on high it all comes out
this<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:24.060> barely<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.510> any<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this one I'm barely out any of the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
this one I'm barely out any of the
others<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> turn<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> right

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
others but if you turn on just the right

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.620 
others but if you turn on just the right
amount<00:00:28.609> yeah<00:00:29.609> I'll<00:00:29.699> go<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:30.029> pretty<00:00:30.480> much

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
amount yeah I'll go about pretty much

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:41.439 
amount yeah I'll go about pretty much
the<00:00:30.779> same

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.209 

this<00:00:41.719> one<00:00:41.930> since<00:00:42.500> its<00:00:42.680> first<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.070> obviously

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
this one since its first is obviously

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.720 
this one since its first is obviously
going<00:00:43.609> to<00:00:43.699> get<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.850> little<00:00:44.059> bit<00:00:44.149> more<00:00:48.699> you<00:00:49.699> know

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
going to get a little bit more you know

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.990 
going to get a little bit more you know
fog<00:00:50.449> than<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.809> rest<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:51.430> it's<00:00:52.430> not<00:00:52.640> too<00:00:52.850> much

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
fog than the rest but it's not too much

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.509 
fog than the rest but it's not too much
more<00:00:56.469> my<00:00:57.469> camera<00:00:57.799> keeps<00:00:57.979> trying<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.250> find<00:00:58.430> my

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
more my camera keeps trying to find my

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:10.440 
more my camera keeps trying to find my
face<00:01:06.009> so

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.780 

I<00:01:10.479> had<00:01:11.050> just<00:01:11.080> missed<00:01:11.710> at<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:11.979> tanks<00:01:12.430> before<00:01:12.760> I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
I had just missed at the tanks before I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.700 
I had just missed at the tanks before I
kind<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.120> felt<00:01:13.690> like<00:01:13.780> hey<00:01:14.020> one-eye<00:01:14.290> let's<00:01:14.560> just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
kind of felt like hey one-eye let's just

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.500 
kind of felt like hey one-eye let's just
try<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:14.920> get<00:01:15.010> this<00:01:15.159> going<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:18.450> instead<00:01:19.450> of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
try and get this going so instead of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.630 
try and get this going so instead of
turning<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.020> tank<00:01:20.440> completely<00:01:20.979> dark<00:01:21.430> which

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
turning the tank completely dark which

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.800 
turning the tank completely dark which
it's<00:01:21.820> starting<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.330> do<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:25.330> actually<00:01:25.450> works

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
it's starting to do it actually works

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's starting to do it actually works
pretty<00:01:25.960> well<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:29.310> wet<00:01:30.310> cloth

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
pretty well I have a little wet cloth

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.390 
pretty well I have a little wet cloth
down<00:01:31.930> there<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.290> mighty<00:01:32.440> holding<00:01:33.310> out

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
down there and mighty holding out

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.120 
down there and mighty holding out
because<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.810> missing<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> part<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.590> guess<00:01:35.979> I

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
because I was missing a part I guess I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.840 
because I was missing a part I guess I
didn't<00:01:36.400> get<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> straight<00:01:37.110> extender<00:01:38.850> half

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
didn't get the straight extender half

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.440 
didn't get the straight extender half
inch<00:01:40.119> fits<00:01:40.540> perfectly<00:01:41.170> snug<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:41.680> these<00:01:42.450> and

inch fits perfectly snug on these and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.490 
inch fits perfectly snug on these and
then<00:01:43.570> it's<00:01:43.720> used<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.080> half-inch<00:01:47.250> pbc<00:01:48.390> its

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
then it's used to half-inch pbc its

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
timer on the way that is going to help

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.569 
timer on the way that is going to help
me<00:02:13.060> turn<00:02:13.209> on<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.720> know<00:02:13.840> every<00:02:14.250> how<00:02:15.250> many<00:02:15.400> ever

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
me turn on you know every how many ever

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.530 
me turn on you know every how many ever
hours<00:02:15.910> for<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.329> a<00:02:16.450> couple<00:02:16.600> minutes<00:02:16.780> so
