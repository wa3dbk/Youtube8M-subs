00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
that at the time my team I think both

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.870 
that at the time my team I think both
the<00:02:06.119> brothers<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:07.079> both<00:02:07.380> wanted<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.190> vehicle

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
the brothers they both wanted a vehicle

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120 
the brothers they both wanted a vehicle
that<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> sort<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.380> go<00:02:10.560> anywhere<00:02:10.590> do

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
that was a sort of go anywhere do

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.070 
that was a sort of go anywhere do
anything<00:02:11.280> vehicle<00:02:12.030> something<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:12.870> was

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
anything vehicle something which was

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.820 
anything vehicle something which was
more<00:02:13.760> utilitarian<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> car<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.290> think

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
more utilitarian not like a car I think

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400 
more utilitarian not like a car I think
