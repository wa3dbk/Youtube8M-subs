 and the challenge of the month of February I'm also going 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.699
 to be doing a blog with all the 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.100
 videos of the girls who joined 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.620
 right now in January and now 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.679
 I leave with my video inspired by a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.989
 sensitivity for girls the last taste 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.300
 to recreate that he lives in Palermo is this 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.210
 I was fascinated by the combination of colors 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.909
 psychic dominated by the Labor Party 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 contrast of colors and especially 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.620
 This is one of my favorites 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.430
 intense I'm using this month cup and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.920
 pants of them Monday and they passed me 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.470
 stranded I am using this alleged 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 ko 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.980
 and so much this place be green that it has 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.410
 the golden buttons and I really like the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.750
 detail what there was quite the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.420
 attention is that they make a reality 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.510
 crisis down below and it's 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 Looking for beige tones with black like 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.000
 complements and good to see in what 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.800
 At that time, it is necessary for the son mine, but if 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 they combine because the neutrals combine 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.860
 each other and I love it because I the most 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 seemed like the constant for this look 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.930
 were these shoes that have the with 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 know and they are black and those of them are at 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.830
 otherwise it has a black tip and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 and also that when a bag 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.130
 tones and I'm going to use this bag that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.770
 I have two tones and 1 star using 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.710
 a bracelet of a human and another by 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.960
 Greater city and is in the other hand 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.940
 everything else is simple have other 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
 I'm going to do more 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.009
 my taste and hair does not have 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.009
 Fully tour is complete 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.370
 do not 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 all right 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 but not
