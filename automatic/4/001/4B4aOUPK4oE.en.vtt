00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
powder inside and we are about to see

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
powder inside and we are about to see
how<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> system<00:00:32.219> works<00:00:32.690> once<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> water<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
how the system works once the water is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
how the system works once the water is
hot<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.190> race<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> top<00:00:40.129> whether<00:00:41.129> your

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hot it will race to the top whether your

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.440 
hot it will race to the top whether your
coffee<00:00:42.210> powder<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.750> located<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.940> run

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
coffee powder is located and it will run

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
coffee powder is located and it will run
through<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.870> coffee<00:00:46.079> powder<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.210> eventually

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
through the coffee powder and eventually

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.430 
through the coffee powder and eventually
through<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> pipe<00:00:48.930> inside<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:51.140> coffee<00:00:52.140> maker

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
through the pipe inside the coffee maker

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.630 
through the pipe inside the coffee maker
that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.039> inside<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.579> glass<00:00:54.090> container

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
that you see inside the glass container

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.510 
that you see inside the glass container
it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.699> run<00:00:57.030> through<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> pipe<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> then

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
it will run through the pipe and then

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.529 
it will run through the pipe and then
eventually<00:00:59.520> end<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:01.489> in<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.300> glass

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
eventually end up in the in the glass

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
eventually end up in the in the glass
container<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.309> unique

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
container so this is a very unique

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.620 
container so this is a very unique
system<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:07.020> old<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> allottee<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
system very old and the allottee has I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
system very old and the allottee has I
think<00:01:10.140> invented<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.820> have

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
think invented it and they have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.550 
think invented it and they have
different<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:14.390> those<00:01:15.390> coffee<00:01:16.140> makers

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.010 
it kind of tastes like you know what it
tastes<00:02:44.650> okay<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.420> certain<00:02:46.840> point

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
tastes okay like go to a certain point

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.520 
tastes okay like go to a certain point
but<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.030> can't<00:02:49.270> really<00:02:49.420> compare<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
but not you can't really compare it to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.759 
but not you can't really compare it to
this<00:02:50.680> one<00:02:50.739> here<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.209> go<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> two<00:02:53.260> espresso

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
this one here if you go to two espresso

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.860 
this one here if you go to two espresso
bar<00:02:54.100> or<00:02:54.370> tool<00:02:54.790> coffee<00:02:55.090> shop<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.690> have

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
bar or tool coffee shop and they have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.080 
bar or tool coffee shop and they have
and<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.470> those<00:02:57.130> professional<00:02:57.760> machines

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
and this those professional machines

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.910 
and this those professional machines
there<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.930> cost<00:02:59.110> ten<00:02:59.410> fifteen<00:02:59.890> twenty

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
there that cost ten fifteen twenty

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.840 
there that cost ten fifteen twenty
thousand<00:03:00.550> euros<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.070> about<00:03:03.340> equal<00:03:03.790> in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
thousand euros that is about equal in

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.870 
thousand euros that is about equal in
taste<00:03:04.209> if<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.750> buy<00:03:05.590> one<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.830> those<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
taste if you buy one of those in a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.509 
taste if you buy one of those in a
regular<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.810> regular<00:03:08.620> espresso<00:03:09.010> bar<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
regular at the regular espresso bar and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.910 
regular at the regular espresso bar and
then<00:03:10.150> compare<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.470> machine

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
then compare it with this little machine

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.259 
then compare it with this little machine
here<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:13.090> are<00:03:13.209> about<00:03:13.390> equal<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:13.900> taste<00:03:14.170> okay

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
here they are about equal in taste okay

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.300 
here they are about equal in taste okay
now<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.329> coffee<00:03:16.720> started<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.829> run<00:03:18.010> through

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
now the coffee started to to run through

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.180 
now the coffee started to to run through
you<00:03:18.579> can<00:03:18.790> see<00:03:19.030> how<00:03:19.329> slowly<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.980> glass

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you can see how slowly the glass

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.990 
you can see how slowly the glass
container<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.850> being<00:03:22.090> filled<00:03:23.640> very<00:03:24.640> slowly

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
container is being filled very slowly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.720 
container is being filled very slowly
that<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.450> coffee<00:03:25.799> runs<00:03:26.799> down<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.220> pipe<00:03:27.459> there

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
that the coffee runs down the pipe there

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.330 
that the coffee runs down the pipe there
I<00:03:27.940> think<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.200> system<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.799> based<00:03:30.070> on

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I think it's the system is based on

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.280 
I think it's the system is based on
pressure<00:03:31.500> once<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.860> water<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.780> almost

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
pressure once the the water is is almost

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.120 
pressure once the the water is is almost
boiling<00:03:35.610> obviously<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.870> water<00:03:38.049> steam<00:03:38.470> raises

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
boiling obviously the water steam raises

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.030 
boiling obviously the water steam raises
up<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.660> provides<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.810> pressure<00:03:41.079> for<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
up and provides the pressure for the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.720 
up and provides the pressure for the
water<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.549> run<00:03:43.000> through<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.950> run<00:03:45.130> through<00:03:45.459> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
water to run through to run through the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.150 
water to run through to run through the
the<00:03:46.090> whole<00:03:46.239> system<00:03:46.720> otherwise<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.709> wouldn't

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
the whole system otherwise it wouldn't

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.460 
the whole system otherwise it wouldn't
be<00:03:48.250> able<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:49.329> run<00:03:49.450> upwards<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.110> because<00:03:50.440> of

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
be able to to run upwards but because of

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.280 
be able to to run upwards but because of
the<00:03:50.650> pressure<00:03:50.950> being<00:03:51.459> developed<00:03:52.110> that's<00:03:53.110> how

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
the pressure being developed that's how

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.680 
the pressure being developed that's how
it<00:03:53.440> works<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:53.950> now<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:55.239> can<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:55.690> how<00:03:55.950> nicely

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
it works so now you can see how nicely

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.449 
it works so now you can see how nicely
the<00:03:58.690> container<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.410> filling<00:04:00.070> with<00:04:00.100> coffee<00:04:00.690> and

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the container is filling with coffee and

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.580 
the container is filling with coffee and
I<00:04:03.840> don't<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.049> should<00:04:05.260> take<00:04:05.470> about<00:04:05.620> maybe

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
I don't know it should take about maybe

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.140 
I don't know it should take about maybe
roughly<00:04:08.590> 90<00:04:08.890> seconds<00:04:09.280> maybe<00:04:09.430> two<00:04:09.700> minutes<00:04:10.030> at

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
roughly 90 seconds maybe two minutes at

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.210 
roughly 90 seconds maybe two minutes at
the<00:04:10.269> most<00:04:10.299> for<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.230> whole<00:04:12.480> coffee<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.780> be<00:04:14.220> for

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
the most for the whole coffee to be for

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.060 
the most for the whole coffee to be for
the<00:04:15.280> whole<00:04:15.400> water<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.180> run<00:04:16.359> through<00:04:16.630> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
the whole water to to run through and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.840 
the whole water to to run through and
you<00:04:19.060> should<00:04:19.270> also<00:04:19.920> if<00:04:20.920> you<00:04:21.100> prepare<00:04:21.520> this<00:04:21.640> you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
you should also if you prepare this you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.840 
you should also if you prepare this you
shouldn't<00:04:22.090> set<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.550> stove<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
shouldn't set the the stove to the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.570 
shouldn't set the the stove to the
highest<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> highest<00:04:26.530> level<00:04:26.830> for<00:04:27.010> example

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
highest to the highest level for example

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.700 
highest to the highest level for example
to<00:04:27.970> 6<00:04:29.190> then<00:04:30.190> it'll<00:04:30.940> boil<00:04:31.120> too<00:04:31.420> quickly<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.140> it

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
to 6 then it'll boil too quickly and it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.340 
to 6 then it'll boil too quickly and it
once<00:04:33.310> through<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.880> too<00:04:34.180> quickly<00:04:34.480> so<00:04:34.810> maybe

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
once through to too quickly so maybe

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.550 
once through to too quickly so maybe
three<00:04:35.710> or<00:04:35.740> four<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.310> is<00:04:36.520> perfect<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:38.380> can

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
three or four is is perfect and you can

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.350 
three or four is is perfect and you can
hear<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.220> little<00:04:39.310> steaming<00:04:39.850> noises<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:43.150> now

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
hear the little steaming noises it's now

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.150 
hear the little steaming noises it's now
the<00:04:44.080> coffee<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.440> now<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:45.100> final<00:04:45.490> stage<00:04:45.730> and

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
the coffee is now in a final stage and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.980 
the coffee is now in a final stage and
with<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> remaining<00:04:48.610> air<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.750> running

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
with the remaining air is running

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.170 
with the remaining air is running
through<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:53.520> it's<00:04:54.520> about<00:04:54.730> done

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
through and it's about done

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.170 
through and it's about done
I<00:04:56.340> can<00:04:57.340> even<00:04:57.460> see<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.940> steam<00:04:58.480> escaping<00:04:59.320> there

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
I can even see the steam escaping there

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.420 
I can even see the steam escaping there
and<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:03.220> about<00:05:03.490> now<00:05:03.670> it's<00:05:03.970> it's<00:05:04.180> done<00:05:04.360> and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
and just about now it's it's done and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.490 
and just about now it's it's done and
also<00:05:06.430> important<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.210> if<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.810> use<00:05:07.990> those<00:05:08.230> you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
also important is if you use those you

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.130 
also important is if you use those you
should<00:05:08.680> always<00:05:08.860> fill<00:05:09.310> up<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.700> cup<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.750> filter

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
should always fill up the cup the filter

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.070 
should always fill up the cup the filter
that<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.500> gonna<00:05:12.160> shout<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.610> go<00:05:12.760> so<00:05:13.450> no<00:05:13.630> you

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
that I gonna shout to go so no you
