00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.229 
or not but I'm just going to try it so
the<00:03:03.590> next<00:03:03.620> thing<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.100> got<00:03:04.310> I've<00:03:04.459> also<00:03:04.670> been<00:03:04.970> kind

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
of eyeing for a while and this doesn't

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.320 
of eyeing for a while and this doesn't
make<00:03:06.830> any<00:03:06.890> sense<00:03:07.280> because<00:03:07.670> we're<00:03:07.850> almost<00:03:08.000> in

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
