00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
gorgeous look for the longest time I did

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
gorgeous look for the longest time I did
wear<00:00:45.780> clip-in<00:00:46.170> hair<00:00:46.200> extensions<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.190> those

were<00:00:47.550> okay<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> admit<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.620> were

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
were okay but I have to admit they were

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
were okay but I have to admit they were
a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.070> bulky<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> even<00:00:51.449> clip<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.840> hair

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a little bulky and even clip in hair

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
a little bulky and even clip in hair
extensions<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:53.190> damage<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.699> hair

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
extensions can actually damage your hair

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
extensions can actually damage your hair
if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.690> apply<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.500> correctly<00:00:55.680> they

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
if you don't apply them correctly they

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
if you don't apply them correctly they
will<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.550> leave<00:00:56.910> bald<00:00:57.210> spots<00:00:57.539> because

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
will actually leave bald spots because

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
will actually leave bald spots because
the<00:00:58.079> clip<00:00:58.289> west's<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> heavy<00:00:59.789> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the clip west's are kind of heavy so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.229 
the clip west's are kind of heavy so
that<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.559> fact<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:03.000> to

that is a little fact for you not to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
that is a little fact for you not to
mention<00:01:03.270> my<00:01:03.660> styling<00:01:04.140> options<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.680> clip<00:01:04.860> in

discovered tape and hair extensions but

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
discovered tape and hair extensions but
I<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.710> cautious<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I was very cautious going into it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
I was very cautious going into it
because<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.150> wasn't<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.470> were

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
because I wasn't sure if these were

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.320 
because I wasn't sure if these were
going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> damage<00:01:17.070> my<00:01:17.369> hair<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.640> already<00:01:18.150> have

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.200 
been here I could not stand to lose more
hair<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> took<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> risk<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.790> tried

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hair and so I took a risk and I tried

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
hair and so I took a risk and I tried
out<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.509> tape<00:01:24.720> extensions<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:26.070> the
