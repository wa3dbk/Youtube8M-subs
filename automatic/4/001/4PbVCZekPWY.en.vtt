00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
the one app that shows a lot of lag is

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.229 
the one app that shows a lot of lag is
artrage<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.589> much<00:01:02.239> sketchbook

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
a little bit of noise on the screen but

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.790 
a little bit of noise on the screen but
nothing<00:03:38.950> too<00:03:39.160> bad<00:03:45.870> would<00:03:46.870> be<00:03:47.020> easy<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.320> use<00:03:47.620> it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
nothing too bad would be easy to use it

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.420 
nothing too bad would be easy to use it
to<00:03:47.920> take<00:03:48.100> notes<00:03:48.370> with<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.220> for

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
to take notes with it not just for

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.060 
to take notes with it not just for
sketching<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:55.440> mostly<00:03:56.440> use<00:03:56.500> these<00:03:56.860> for

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
sketching I mostly use these for

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:11.790

I'll be testing out a couple more

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.759 
I'll be testing out a couple more
programs<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.580> see<00:04:19.049> which<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.260> program<00:04:20.680> I

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
programs and see which is the program I

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.820 
programs and see which is the program I
like<00:04:20.950> best<00:04:21.480> right<00:04:22.480> now<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:23.170> one<00:04:23.470> and
