00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.520 

his<00:01:22.060> first<00:01:22.329> few<00:01:22.479> stages<00:01:22.780> are<00:01:23.289> going<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:23.469> be

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
his first few stages are going to be

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.990 
his first few stages are going to be
really<00:01:23.950> really<00:01:23.979> easy<00:01:26.399> but<00:01:27.399> once<00:01:27.700> i<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:27.909> about

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
really really easy but once i get about

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.929 
really really easy but once i get about
stage<00:01:28.509> six<00:01:29.049> that's<00:01:29.890> one<00:01:30.430> is<00:01:30.579> going<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> get

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
stage six that's one is going to get

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.100 
stage six that's one is going to get
really<00:01:31.149> really<00:01:31.659> hard<00:01:34.469> so<00:01:35.469> vs<00:01:36.899> vs<00:01:37.899> special

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
really really hard so vs vs special

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.399 
really really hard so vs vs special
ability<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.189> her<00:01:39.520> gauge<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:41.110> allows

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
ability is that her gauge which allows

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.980 
ability is that her gauge which allows
her<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.649> cast<00:01:41.920> spells<00:01:42.450> charges<00:01:43.450> really

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
her to cast spells charges really

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.660 
her to cast spells charges really
quickly<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.750> kind<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.590> see<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.100> look<00:01:48.490> right

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
quickly and I kind of see it look right

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.510 
quickly and I kind of see it look right
at<00:01:48.819> that<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.360> her<00:01:50.229> extra<00:01:50.710> attack<00:01:51.069> which

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
at that and her extra attack which

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.620 
at that and her extra attack which
happens<00:01:52.390> if<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.840> shoot<00:01:53.110> one<00:01:53.289> of<00:01:53.409> these<00:01:53.530> souls

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
happens if I shoot one of these souls

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.080 
happens if I shoot one of these souls
will<00:01:55.630> shoot<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.289> beam<00:01:56.649> on<00:01:56.979> my<00:01:57.220> opponents<00:01:57.729> screen

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
will shoot a beam on my opponents screen

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.309 
will shoot a beam on my opponents screen
from<00:01:58.659> bottom<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.409> top<00:02:00.720> it's<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:02.259> that

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
from bottom to the top it's not that

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.580 
from bottom to the top it's not that
useful<00:02:02.890> really<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.970> could<00:02:07.149> shot<00:02:07.689> with

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
useful really but if you could shot with

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.350 
useful really but if you could shot with
that<00:02:08.739> at<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> wrong<00:02:09.250> time<00:02:09.580> you'll<00:02:10.239> get

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that at the wrong time you'll get

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440 
that at the wrong time you'll get
trapped<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.840> corner<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.819> probably<00:02:12.819> die<00:02:13.090> for

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
trapped in a corner and probably die for

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.000 
trapped in a corner and probably die for
it<00:02:14.610> whoa

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.300 

my<00:02:19.610> son<00:02:20.239> never<00:02:20.390> been<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.349> lot<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.590> psycho<00:02:21.980> than

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
usual there we go that's more like it

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.360 
usual there we go that's more like it
you<00:02:30.049> can<00:02:30.200> probably<00:02:30.379> manage<00:02:30.590> several<00:02:30.980> stages

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
you can probably manage several stages

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.170 
you can probably manage several stages

start moving slower than she usually

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.590 
start moving slower than she usually
does<00:03:28.170> makes<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.320> easier<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.740> dodge<00:03:30.360> plus<00:03:31.360> the

beam will automatically activate the
souls<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.270> cause<00:03:34.480> them<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.780> rise<00:03:34.990> on<00:03:35.020> my

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
souls and cause them to rise on my

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.490 
souls and cause them to rise on my
screen<00:03:35.910> which<00:03:36.910> makes<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.660> easier<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.140> shoot

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
screen which makes it easier to shoot

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.960

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:06:10.090 

you

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.180 

Oh<00:06:10.750> hurt<00:06:12.220> her<00:06:13.220> extra<00:06:13.790> attack<00:06:14.500> it's<00:06:15.500> tore<00:06:16.040> that

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
Oh hurt her extra attack it's tore that

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.300 
Oh hurt her extra attack it's tore that
works<00:06:16.430> like<00:06:16.640> Randy's<00:06:17.090> does<00:06:18.070> I'm<00:06:19.070> not<00:06:19.250> sure

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
works like Randy's does I'm not sure

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.810 
works like Randy's does I'm not sure
will<00:06:19.550> see<00:06:19.790> mainly<00:06:19.970> on<00:06:20.270> this<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:20.660> that<00:06:21.010> but<00:06:22.010> it

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
will see mainly on this and that but it

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.760 
will see mainly on this and that but it
bounces<00:06:23.270> off<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:23.480> side<00:06:23.810> but<00:06:24.110> it<00:06:24.140> has<00:06:24.350> slightly

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
bounces off the side but it has slightly

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.140 
bounces off the side but it has slightly
less<00:06:25.670> of<00:06:25.850> our<00:06:25.940> range<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.420> maintenances

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.190 

so<00:06:30.720> it's<00:06:31.050> easier<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.560> dodge<00:06:31.850> but<00:06:32.960> it<00:06:33.960> will

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
so it's easier to dodge but it will

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.400 
so it's easier to dodge but it will
continue<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.710> bounce<00:06:34.980> off<00:06:35.160> a<00:06:35.220> wall<00:06:35.520> like<00:06:35.550> that

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.600 

so<00:06:40.410> if<00:06:40.560> you're<00:06:40.710> not<00:06:40.800> careful<00:06:41.010> you're<00:06:41.340> standing

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
so if you're not careful you're standing

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.800 
so if you're not careful you're standing
you<00:06:41.970> can<00:06:42.000> get<00:06:42.450> get<00:06:42.600> on<00:06:42.720> a<00:06:42.750> rebound<00:06:42.990> shot

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.030 

I<00:06:49.870> didn't<00:06:50.260> your<00:06:50.380> life<00:06:50.500> is<00:06:50.650> going<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:50.889> go<00:06:50.950> that

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040
