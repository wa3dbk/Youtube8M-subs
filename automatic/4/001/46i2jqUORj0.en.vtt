00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
first thing that you want to do is wash

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.459 
first thing that you want to do is wash
your<00:00:33.649> hands<00:00:34.370> with<00:00:34.700> Dawn<00:00:35.059> dishwashing<00:00:36.050> soap

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.680 
your hands with Dawn dishwashing soap
and<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.489> reason<00:00:37.789> that<00:00:37.879> I<00:00:37.940> say<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:38.269> is

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
and the reason that I say that is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.869 
and the reason that I say that is
because<00:00:38.749> it<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.739> degreaser<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.429> it<00:00:40.760> will

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
because it is a degreaser and it will

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.169 
because it is a degreaser and it will
get<00:00:41.030> rid<00:00:41.059> of<00:00:41.239> excess<00:00:41.659> oils<00:00:42.109> on<00:00:42.350> your<00:00:42.559> hand<00:00:42.859> or
