00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
why would I just go with something like

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.159 
why would I just go with something like
the<00:06:30.789> g2<00:06:31.090> X<00:06:31.300> or<00:06:31.539> go<00:06:31.630> something<00:06:31.960> like<00:06:31.990> the

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
the g2 X or go something like the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
experience and a lot of cases will be

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.010
