00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
bring on some more new clinics so we

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.300 
bring on some more new clinics so we
this<00:02:29.480> year<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.959> for<00:02:30.560> instance<00:02:30.650> big<00:02:31.160> wall

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
this year we have for instance big wall

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.930 
this year we have for instance big wall
climbing<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:32.440> ski<00:02:33.440> mountaineering<00:02:33.889> and<00:02:34.160> we

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
climbing and ski mountaineering and we

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.300 
climbing and ski mountaineering and we
also<00:02:35.090> try<00:02:35.329> to<00:02:35.389> to<00:02:36.260> keep<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> group<00:02:36.859> smaller

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
also try to to keep the group smaller

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.000 
also try to to keep the group smaller
than<00:02:38.030> before<00:02:38.780> because<00:02:38.959> some<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.739> had<00:02:39.859> some

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
than before because some you had some

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.440 
than before because some you had some
feedback<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.459> maybe<00:02:40.639> you<00:02:40.849> know<00:02:40.970> like<00:02:41.000> be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
feedback that maybe you know like be

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.659 
feedback that maybe you know like be
better<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:42.099> smaller<00:02:43.099> groups<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.489> get

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:43.669 
better to have smaller groups to get

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.940 
better to have smaller groups to get
more<00:02:43.849> attention<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.660> each<00:02:45.169> individual<00:02:45.799> that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
more attention to each individual that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.190 
more attention to each individual that
participate<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.090> that's<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.690> reason<00:02:47.840> why<00:02:47.989> we

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
participate so that's the reason why we

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.659 
participate so that's the reason why we
kind<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.680> tried<00:02:48.889> to<00:02:48.919> keep<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> numbers<00:02:49.639> down

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:49.669 
kind of tried to keep the numbers down

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.229 
kind of tried to keep the numbers down
this<00:02:49.940> year

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
this year

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.460 
this year
ya<00:02:50.480> know<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.690> think<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.019> highlight<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.410> me
