we've<00:01:05.300> got<00:01:05.449> Anna<00:01:05.570> just<00:01:05.810> around<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.170> waist<00:01:06.380> so

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
we've got Anna just around the waist so

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.100 
we've got Anna just around the waist so
it<00:01:07.400> pulls<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.970> jacket<00:01:08.300> tighten<00:01:08.690> these<00:01:08.780> areas

stands for extended comfort range so as

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.429 
stands for extended comfort range so as
twenty<00:03:18.329> five<00:03:18.510> percent<00:03:18.540> more<00:03:19.049> breathability

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
twenty five percent more breathability

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.949 
twenty five percent more breathability

than the standard gore-tex the pro shell

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.809 
than the standard gore-tex the pro shell
element<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.680> means<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.310> gore-tex<00:03:23.519> is

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
element of it means that the gore-tex is

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.189 
element of it means that the gore-tex is
laminated<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.509> the<00:03:24.569> back<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.989> face

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199

laminated to the back of the face
material<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.949> top<00:03:26.129> of<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.310> jacket<00:03:26.699> this

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:27.509 
material on the top of the jacket this

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.360 
material on the top of the jacket this
has<00:03:27.659> three<00:03:27.900> advantages<00:03:28.139> one<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.949> water<00:03:29.129> can't

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
has three advantages one the water can't

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.439 
has three advantages one the water can't
ingress<00:03:29.669> through<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:29.970> outside<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.389> the

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
ingress through the outside of the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.210 
ingress through the outside of the
jacket<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.379> jacket<00:03:31.650> doesn't<00:03:31.799> get<00:03:31.979> heavy

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
jacket so the jacket doesn't get heavy

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.849 
jacket so the jacket doesn't get heavy
less<00:03:32.639> breathable<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.239> wet<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.560> second

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
less breathable and wet the second

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.589 
less breathable and wet the second
language<00:03:35.009> is<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.579> reduces<00:03:35.729> the<00:03:36.180> air<00:03:36.329> gaps

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
language is that it reduces the air gaps

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.619 
language is that it reduces the air gaps
between<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.439> layers<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:38.699> so<00:03:39.359> that<00:03:39.389> you

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
between the layers so that so that you

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.149 
between the layers so that so that you
again<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.169> can<00:03:40.319> breathe<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.530> easily<00:03:40.739> so

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
again you can breathe more easily so

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.649 
again you can breathe more easily so
you've<00:03:41.250> got<00:03:41.280> less<00:03:41.579> area<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.060> push<00:03:42.269> the

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
you've got less area to push the

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.740 
you've got less area to push the
moisture<00:03:43.259> out<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.409> and<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.489> third

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
moisture out of and the third

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.399 
moisture out of and the third
improvement<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.019> can<00:03:46.199> add<00:03:46.290> the

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
improvement is that you can add the

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.629 
improvement is that you can add the
armored<00:03:46.650> core<00:03:46.799> onto<00:03:46.979> the<00:03:47.040> outside<00:03:47.189> of<00:03:47.400> it

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
armored core onto the outside of it

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.860 
armored core onto the outside of it
which<00:03:47.759> you<00:03:47.879> can't<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.389> conventional

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
which you can't do the conventional

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.469 
which you can't do the conventional
gore-tex<00:03:49.199> jacket<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.790> 2010

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
gore-tex jacket and this is the 2010

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.379 
gore-tex jacket and this is the 2010
armadillo<00:03:52.079> jacket
