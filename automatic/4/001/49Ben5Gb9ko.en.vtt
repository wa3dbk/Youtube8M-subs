00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.120

 I figured the guys will stay 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 disappointed when I learned that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 It was the Lord's hymn, you see. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.939
 I was disappointed I hoped they would 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.159
 they were right to do something different but 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.500
 any form of survival itself is not a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 boring way I played your name w3 south 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.710

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.390
 Sir, you're going to sleep w3 and the right goal. 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 As I told you, they were not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 revealed is a lot of information including 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 the trailer that came out today was not a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.880
 trailer just to show the cope just for 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.409
 To reveal the pop in Brazil a trailer 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.479
 mixing the ii multiplayer campaign and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.700
 copy with a trailer talking about the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 game showing some of the three modules 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.509
 and with that ended up consequently 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 revealing to us cop and a few 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.129
 gameplay scenes do not show much 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.539
 There's not much in it if we analyze it. 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.280
 are owing background trail will stay 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 running to you is a very hard job 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.590
 cool featured 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.690
 by the way 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.879
 the graphic part of the game is by the smaller 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.730
 especially in our canteens you 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.790
 sees the characters partially 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.470
 next so it's very good graphic too 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.459
 good even though it actually came to a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.200
 level of new generation and there is good 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.060
 that talking is like I said I saw you 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.799
 trailer left at 2 pm and the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.989
 two and a half hygiene has launched a new 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.680
 episode of the strong yen is that series which 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.330
 they are doing cover up is the advent 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.220
 of earth to talk a little more about 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.590
 the cop but in fact what they did 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.530
 it was an analysis of about 20 minutes there 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 they analyze all the scenes of the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.310
 trailer so they did not leave three 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 background rounds and 1 commenting know 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.269
 kind things with a micro with the side 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.540
 Macroeconomics is the co-founder of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.310
 Then Sledgehammer was talking and such is 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.910
 when he arrived in the part of the cope also 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.620
 They did not reveal many things right. 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.090
 Anyway, I'll pass on here for you part 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.610
 of what I know part of what they do not 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.019
 spoke is not because finally now no longer 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.910
 has more trouble in revealing until 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.970
 because they are not nothing big things 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.200
 Yes and is a living being is a worthy 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.180
 infinite waves 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.910
 divided equally was for example 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.220
 oe w3 netinha the average easy maps 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.200
 It's going to be difficult at that time. 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.720
 always with the mode maps 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.590
 multiplayer is almost a star 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 Iraclézia midfielder is and everything is based 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.310
 we upgrade your break you can 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.769
 make upgrades on it just as you can 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.209
 upgrade your weapons and even 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.880
 I even think the spirit will power 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.650
 there are malls as there would be w3 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.019
 google employee if there were no 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.819
 National shopping malls in your pocket are all you 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.620
 get on time the caps are falling 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.370
 You're going to pick things up, do not you? 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.010
 mall 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.959
 the w3 guardian on the adn winner will come back 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 to shock you with practices that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.030
 strike buy an improvement for your 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.910
 improvement and strike improvement for swiss 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.280
 break and first of all are you going to have 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.019
 which to choose between three is class 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.690
 different basically three 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.150
 left of classes did not break this is 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.659
 basically one light armor 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.680
 light armor and armor have right 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.810
 armor amateur fish 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 It will be so it will be called then in the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.930
 light armor you have greater mobility 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.630
 the bigger the leap is in the network you have more life 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.250
 kind of stuff is I'll pass 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.229
 more details about this in another video 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.720
 because even this was not revealed by the 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.009
 by the gm still right, but you? 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.050
 basically they said they were going to 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.520
 have three classes in the video from there 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.600
 they did not give details about each 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.650
 one of them I will not give details either 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.080
 still here 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.490
 but more ahead I speak in another 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.560
 video do much just to talk about 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.930
 This is where you can upgrade 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.520
 in turn I want one either 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.650
 three you've chosen you have to 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.889
 possibility of upgrading're 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.750
 and like I said we have scott too 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.280
 hicks in this way apparently the people 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.560
 will have two ways of getting the 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.000
 cuts one of them is through the bar 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.919
 what is going on with you guys must have 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.900
 I'm going to put a 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.430
 screenshot that you can see that 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.020
 there in the upper left top if I do not 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.460
 I'm wrong, there's a little bar going. 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.259
 loading as you kill 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.449
 Whenever she carries, she 'll send a 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.370
 carpet for you to conquer and random 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.349
 It's the other way you can get a 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.440
 Escort is clear at shopping mall 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.270
 As I said, it's good, so that's how it goes. 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.820
 You're going to have no money in 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.430
 way you will win are points right 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.080
 that for you to buy at the mall and sound 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.870
 sort of square bridges equal to 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.159
 people have there in the pictures in the goals is 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.860
 basically so it will not work 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.289
 has money and what was the national w3 w3 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.750
 is another interesting information is that 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.699
 People are going to have some kind of schelin in the middle. 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.380
 in order to be fulfilled 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.479
 just as there is in the extinct for example 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.490
 What did you do this year and win is a 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.560
 and if it 's for you to spend only on your 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.419
 things in the advent of the air will have this 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.639
 also only if you do not comply you are 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.940
 punished then you have to comply 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.110
 these screens are not optional extinction if 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.699
 You meet clearly you win. 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.530
 rewards but you do not comply you are 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.180
 punished they did not speak to certain about 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.190
 the punishments are not 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.409
 but they will exist and the 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.229
 goals are kind to protect you hardy 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.300
 point is more enemies and colleges dog tag 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.560
 things like simple things but 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.630
 must be fulfilled and not you finish 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.250
 being punished in the same way if 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.210
 You win as I told you. 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.330
 rewarded 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.070
 so it's basically a lord's flight 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.380
 improved is more complete 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.080
 okay, they should reveal more details in 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.759
 brief 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.039
 they'll drop in a trailer just to 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.780
 show the cut a bit more because it 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.639
 I really liked Portuguese. 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.770
 little information on flash hygiene maybe 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.680
 own hygiene bid more information 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.319
 until the end of the month and is basically 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.030
 That's when I reinforce it, do not forget 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.710
 that the phrase are not men but has the 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.409
 shoulders they are hiding the game but 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.639
 has yet to come and is basically 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.860
 This is not a lot to talk about 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.150
 really they showed a little but I 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.979
 I think it's going to be a fun way 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.099
 really will not get close to what the 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.930
 men but anyway and a gentleman is going 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.539
 if it's a fun way I really liked the 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.039
 w3c the second goal x and apparently the 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.169
 opponent rafael will be the most robust 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.870
 still and they have not even revealed it yet 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.759
 that the mode can present then I think 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.949
 which may not be all that many 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.349
 They waited but it's still a glass. 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.150
