I don't know I fucking when I hit the
favela<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.610> mad<00:02:21.940> recognition<00:02:22.570> for

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
favela I got like mad recognition for

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.350 
favela I got like mad recognition for
the<00:02:23.350> tilt<00:02:23.770> spin<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:25.000> was<00:02:25.210> probably

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the tilt spin one and that was probably

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.780 
the tilt spin one and that was probably
the<00:02:25.570> best<00:02:25.750> moment<00:02:25.810> TSU<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.580> getting

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the best moment TSU and then getting

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.330 
the best moment TSU and then getting
into<00:02:27.850> dare<00:02:28.120> obviously<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:29.530> for<00:02:29.710> dare<00:02:29.980> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
into dare obviously and then for dare I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.300 
into dare obviously and then for dare I
hit<00:02:31.330> 60<00:02:31.780> clips<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.140> three<00:02:32.320> days<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:33.070> trick

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
hit 60 clips in three days like trick

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.260 
hit 60 clips in three days like trick
shots<00:02:33.550> like<00:02:33.940> kill<00:02:34.180> cams<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:37.150> was

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
shots like kill cams and that was

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.460 
shots like kill cams and that was
probably<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.570> best<00:02:37.780> moment<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.350> then

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
probably the best moment and then

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.260 
probably the best moment and then
getting<00:02:38.770> into<00:02:38.800> phase<00:02:39.130> from<00:02:39.400> there<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.790> have

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
getting into phase from there I have

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.110 
getting into phase from there I have
like<00:02:40.420> five<00:02:40.690> episodes<00:02:41.230> out<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.500> one<00:02:41.890> month<00:02:42.160> so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
like five episodes out in one month so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.290 
like five episodes out in one month so
yeah<00:02:44.490> next<00:02:45.490> question<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:45.940> would<00:02:46.000> win<00:02:46.150> a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
yeah next question what would win a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.290 
yeah next question what would win a
fight<00:02:46.330> an<00:02:46.690> anaconda<00:02:47.320> or<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> mongoose<00:02:47.920> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
fight an anaconda or a mongoose I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.280 
fight an anaconda or a mongoose I
honestly<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:49.540> uh<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:51.340> could<00:02:51.460> go<00:02:51.580> both<00:02:51.730> ways

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
honestly think uh it could go both ways

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.350 
honestly think uh it could go both ways
cuz<00:02:53.290> if<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.590> mongoose<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.190> ripped<00:02:54.940> off<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
cuz if a mongoose like ripped off the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.580 
cuz if a mongoose like ripped off the
anacondas<00:02:55.810> head<00:02:55.990> or<00:02:56.110> something<00:02:56.290> or<00:02:56.560> like

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
anacondas head or something or like

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.050 
anacondas head or something or like
blinded<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> or<00:02:57.550> something<00:02:57.790> i<00:02:57.850> don't<00:02:57.910> even

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
blinded it or something i don't even

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.540 
blinded it or something i don't even
know<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.300> could<00:02:58.420> probably<00:02:58.510> take<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.770> an

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
know I could probably take it but an

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.940 
know I could probably take it but an
anaconda<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.270> fucking<00:03:01.450> huge<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.650> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
anaconda is like fucking huge so if it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.560 
anaconda is like fucking huge so if it
gets<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.460> Mongoose<00:03:03.910> got<00:03:04.060> caught<00:03:04.330> then

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
gets like the Mongoose got caught then

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.250 
gets like the Mongoose got caught then
it'd<00:03:04.660> be<00:03:04.690> fucked<00:03:06.000> next<00:03:07.000> question<00:03:07.300> what's<00:03:08.050> it
