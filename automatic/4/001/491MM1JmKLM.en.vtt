 the girls have atomic weapons 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:16.099
 thermoelectric plants are plants that produce electricity through 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.789
 burning of fuels 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.960
 these fuels when that is very akerson water the screen is 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 turn into a door 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.749
 a revolving door on the line will connect the electrical power 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240
 the other states are 20 km away 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.440
 the river 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.590
 forced to put up with 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.240
 jo 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.199
 the energy generated in these lines of credit and the board of directors 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.199
 during detention to the centers of consumption 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.940
 but she had not seen a ball result nor the settlers and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.300
 converted for having mentioned 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.180
 back to the border stages 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 that's not possible 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.960
 one of the biggest external debt problems in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.869
 due to global warming through the greenhouse effect it left vast acidic 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.869
 shy on burning fuels 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.180
 the main descents are that they can be built close to cities 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.000
 decreasing the distance of the ascending transmission line should be the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.400
 first out 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.460
 in brazil already existing said star grandson that those of biomass than the crowd 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.030
 local organic materials like capillary fifteen since matter myself and others not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.290
 polluting the environment
