00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 delivery of the first installment of the new 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.550
 São Paulo subway line has been postponed 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.219
 once again passed the end of 2008 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.250
 for the beginning of 2010 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.590
 accidents and engineering errors 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.560
 delayed the schedules of the works 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 started in April 2004 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.539
 the most serious of them at the beginning of the year 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 caused the deaths of seven people 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.519
 when the yellow line is completed 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 will transport 900,000 passengers per 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.600
 day today for the first time 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.940
 journalists had access to the work 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 excavation and concreting of tunnels 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 concrete and steel fiber is with this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.930
 mixture that is made the structures of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 the tunnels of line 4 of the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 subway each bow weighs 34 tons to 30 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.110
 meters of depth they are 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.079
 placed side by side forming rings for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.539
 where they will spend the three before who opens 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 Path is a gigantic excavator 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.960
 known as a tattoo, the equipment was 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 imported from Germany and is 75 meters 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 length 10 to 1800 tons per day 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.670
 the tatuzão digs an average of 14 meters 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.560
 of land 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.140
 This is more modern technology. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.570
 she digs by opening tune by placing 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.770
 the rings and forming in title that you 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.899
 are following 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 This is the first time that journalists have 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.450
 access to works on the yellow line 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.479
 work began in April 2004 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 are 11 stations that go from the center to the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.350
 villa sônia 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.079
 the new line will have 13 kilometers and will be 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.460
 interconnected to cptm trains and 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.710
 other subway lines 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 the first part should be delivered 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.020
 until the end of this year, in case 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.459
 had been postponed to the end of 2008 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.850
 changed again 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.429
 passed to the beginning of 2010 the six 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.250
 stations in the plan are light 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.170
 republic of lima 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.539
 and butan 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.880
 the butantã station the last of the six 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.399
 which will be delivered in 2010 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.799
 not being built with a call 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.400
 tattoo in place is being used 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.470
 another technique called dna tm in which they are 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.110
 used explosives and small 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.690
 excavators to make way for the ground 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.579
 according to the subway this type of excavation is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.790
 suitable for difficult terrain 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.220
 penetration was this technique used in 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.370
 pine season when the construction site 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.590
 works collapsed in January this year seven 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.420
 people died and dozens of real estate 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 were banned 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.430
 the consortium says that the works will only be 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.920
 when the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.230
 causes is completed in August the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.660
 drilled holes in the soil caused a 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.790
 of two meters in diameter on the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.590
 pines and last month it was 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 that the rails in one of the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.579
 stretches were misaligned in 80 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.549
 centimeters 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.799
 the subway considered the normal and 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.780
 ensured that this will not disrupt 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.700
 works of thulium is one of the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.150
 question that is what happens in everyday life 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 of any tunnel run here and in the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.830
 world 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.930
 in that case we actually had a 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.989
 misalignment that exceeded what 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.120
 would be reasonable in that does not bring 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.519
 no consequence no cost 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.530
 additional by the subway does not bring 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 no impairment of quality of the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.530
 works so little security and much 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.530
 less than
