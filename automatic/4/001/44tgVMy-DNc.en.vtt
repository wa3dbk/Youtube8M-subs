00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 assuming the amount 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.680
 Facebook users and this population 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620
 one country 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.420
 then I tell you this will be the third country in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.870
 world population after 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.870
 China and India psychologists sound the alarm 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:23.519
 what exactly frightens them let's talk about it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.230
 today and talk unconditionally 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.430
 social networks have a lot 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.109
 positive sides 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.219
 but psychologists are convinced social networks 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 negatively affect love 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 relationship is clear that any person 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.200
 wants to know about his close absolutely 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 all about his affairs contacts behavior and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.809
 how convenient it is to enter the page 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 the object of his adoration so that it all 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 track down but suddenly you see that someone 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 laid out your beloved girl on the wall 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
 the song 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.230
 how do you respond to this and suddenly 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.690
 there are invisible points at which she 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.260
 quite myself happy coexist with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.350
 this person and thoughts about it can 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.049
 disturb and and spawn jardin all 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.159
 control and here you are again and again and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.770
 time and time again 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.869
 update it in a page further I to you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 I guarantee this thirst to control 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.720
 crawl out of the online space 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 And this trend as you understand 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.869
 destructive for any relationship one 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 my friend met the young 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.130
 man and now they had two days 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.690
 active correspondence on the third day she 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.700
 calls me terrified shorts him 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.950
 he doesn't write me anything and girl 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.260
 starts to worry in vain no i 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.790
 I thought that he did not write because because 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.190
 he does not think of me that which I am 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 interesting modern world condition 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.880
 online means only one person 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 computer works 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.160
 busy he left for a moment or not ready 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.500
 communicate all this state online not 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.080
 can tell but we for some time 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 began to assume that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.230
 Like is a sign of love or 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.810
 his absence is not love we consider and 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.450
 trying to isolate the message that we 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.850
 come on social networks something 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.180
 meaningful and important at a time when all 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.980
 significantly and importantly and unequivocally lost in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.690
 text message when same young 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 man communicates with a girl in a cafe 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.420
 looks at her then gets from her 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.040
 post containing a whole range 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.770
 non-verbal parameters of what is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.930
 real communication word attention 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.340
 glance touch intonation gestures 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.160
 uniqueness that is here and now 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.680
 only you are no parallel affairs 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.989
 no parallel messages requiring 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.810
 response in social networks perception 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.450
 only verbal words music 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
 maximum of the picture as you understand from 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.410
 text messages impossible to understand 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.130
 the whole message 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.170
 and in this situation of uncertainty 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.110
 interpretation interpretations are born 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.890
 usually wrong and often false and 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 these empty experiences are real sediment 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.620
 settles somewhere inside of us and spoils our 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.440
 real relationships many couples precisely 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 therefore, deliberately refuse 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.390
 communication psm with or from communication in 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.070
 tell me you social networks 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.070
 there was no such dates when all 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.050
 runs smooth everything's perfect so long 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.330
 until she takes her phone and 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.250
 literally does not go into it 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 and the thing is that man is very 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.540
 important to maintain tactile and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.630
 eye contact and for waking up 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.269
 passion and love desires without it 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.960
 it's just impossible to build sensual 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.610
 relationship is passion and sensuality 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.880
 and deprives us of a huge amount 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.700
 digital devices uniquely complicates 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.590
 process and often spoils the moment fortunately 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.750
 many have long thought about the importance 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.520
 personal communication and steel even emerges 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.220
 interesting social games like 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.380
 for example who takes the first phone 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.360
 and pays for dinner appeared cafe in 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.580
 which is fundamentally absent wai 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.010
 fi to visitors to this cafe 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.810
 could enjoy live communication 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.390
 so for example brand extreme then 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.940
 special event hour of passion which 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.610
 encourages people to abandon all benefits 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.790
 digital civilization for at least 1 hour 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.130
 to experience all the joys of truly 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.550
 intimate communication is valid if everything 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.700
 we will be 1 hour from the network and make this 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.140
 the hour of the hours of passion will not create this new 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.120
 wave reason to think and a chance to learn 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.610
 real taste and passion hour of passion 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.650
 will be held July 16 offer to all 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.230
 support this really cool and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.790
 current initiative 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.800
 join with me who 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.200
