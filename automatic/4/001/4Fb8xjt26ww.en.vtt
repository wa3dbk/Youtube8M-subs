00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
now once that happens you have to do

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
now once that happens you have to do
terrible<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> game<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> again<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
terrible in that game this is again a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
terrible in that game this is again a
theory<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> people<00:01:06.000> were<00:01:06.210> telling<00:01:06.390> me<00:01:06.540> i<00:01:06.750> got

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
theory that people were telling me i got

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
theory that people were telling me i got
the<00:01:07.140> Supply<00:01:07.439> Drop<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> ended<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.700> kind

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the Supply Drop and I ended up just kind

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
the Supply Drop and I ended up just kind
of<00:01:08.939> switching<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> knife<00:01:09.630> only<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> thought

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of switching the knife only so I thought

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
of switching the knife only so I thought
I<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.580> fun<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.000> way

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
I would have a little bit fun that way

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
I would have a little bit fun that way
but<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> ruining<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
but also I would be kind of ruining my

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
but also I would be kind of ruining my
kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.460> KD<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.420> technically

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
kind of KD there it's not technically

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.179 
kind of KD there it's not technically
reverse<00:01:16.110> boosting<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.799> me<00:01:16.920> trying<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
reverse boosting it's just me trying to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
reverse boosting it's just me trying to
knife<00:01:17.400> people<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:18.060> obviously<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
knife people which would obviously and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
knife people which would obviously and
the<00:01:19.500> fielding<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> less<00:01:20.400> kills<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> more

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the fielding you less kills and more

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
the fielding you less kills and more
tests<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.990> anyway<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> went<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
tests so anyway so I went for it I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
tests so anyway so I went for it I
decided<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.540> once<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> was

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
decided to do that and then once it was

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
decided to do that and then once it was
all<00:01:25.259> over<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> went<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.490> my<00:01:26.580> Supply

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
all over I went to open up my Supply

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.929 
all over I went to open up my Supply
Drop<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.530> true<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.250> honestly

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
Drop and see if it was true and honestly

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
Drop and see if it was true and honestly
it<00:01:30.299> looked<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.840> pretty<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.619> was

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it looked like it's pretty good it was

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
it looked like it's pretty good it was
just<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.040> test<00:01:32.430> guys<00:01:32.670> obviously<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.390> could

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
just one test guys obviously it could

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
just one test guys obviously it could
have<00:01:33.600> been<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.960> fluke<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.829> wanted<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> share

with you guys the reaction I had while i
was<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.430> was

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
was going for this just to see if it was

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
was going for this just to see if it was
true<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> who<00:01:39.420> knows<00:01:39.600> maybe<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> true

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

guys<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> recommend<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
guys I'm not going to recommend this

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.789 
guys I'm not going to recommend this
simply<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.350> people<00:01:43.680> going

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
simply because I don't want people going

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
simply because I don't want people going
out<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.189> possibly<00:01:44.610> getting<00:01:45.149> bad<00:01:45.509> for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
out there possibly getting bad for

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
out there possibly getting bad for
reverse<00:01:46.079> boosting<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.280> something

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
reverse boosting it was just something

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
reverse boosting it was just something

to get a good supply drop and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.730 
to get a good supply drop and
Lee<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.320> go<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.470> got<00:02:14.710> a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
Lee if you do this so here we go I got a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.320 
Lee if you do this so here we go I got a
Supply<00:02:15.070> Drop<00:02:15.250> here<00:02:15.550> let's<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.850> ahead<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.030> find

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
Supply Drop here let's go ahead and find

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.570 
Supply Drop here let's go ahead and find
out<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.960> actually<00:02:17.170> true<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.430> not

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
out if it is actually true and if not

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.610 
out if it is actually true and if not
then<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.940> guess<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.630> proved<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> wrong<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.470> here

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
then I guess we proved it wrong so here

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.140 
then I guess we proved it wrong so here
we<00:02:20.710> go<00:02:20.740> Supply<00:02:21.280> Drop<00:02:21.460> let's<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.000> we<00:02:22.060> get

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
we go Supply Drop let's see if we get

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.710 
we go Supply Drop let's see if we get
anything<00:02:22.360> good<00:02:22.860> come<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.030> MP<00:02:25.030> 11<00:02:25.330> express
