00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.500
 that's not much more to the crisis that we've been going through for more than ten 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 years old 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.810
 activist from the port to the prince why think today 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.680
 because we know that his work is gradually being built 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.979
 necessary to come you are zero growth 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.880
 there are 6 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.989
 the sound in his work sinks the bearing after steady landing at 5 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.870
 the country from the beginning she the query of things this is only this 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.120
 singularity at the front 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 the league 1 is the own of the great artisans of the billionaire 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.900
 I have always been to make up for what I say 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.040
 already a little talent 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.460
 dede to attack the art figure of the street of the bassÃ©e create art in the end 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 to destabilize and arvor 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 see all this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.630
 the set of themes water could define as a kind of continuum 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.470
 the mayor with variations 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.170
 then enough remains of the dreams of all dreams of vision the remains of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 remains of what has been said and remains of the saas was precisely 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.310
 during the show these six years 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.200
 we could 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.240
 which would have existed and remains in the state of traces on the canvas 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.150
 so here I work from 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.230
 in e2 photo the photos this do the photos shock I find in the waters 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 echo 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.210
 they figure 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 I do not see them from tasks are almost their surface 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.330
 original I transpose them in painting they are for her are in the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410
 survival a little bit of the action that's going on and that's living the moments that it's 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.349
 open 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.710
 kingsley motivate them 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.509
 and to finish at the same time they go to this action 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.989
 for example if I do not judge the figure man who are taken in 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.129
 in a somewhat catastrophic event I do not know where they are 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.430
 example finally they are afraid to cash in china recently part in the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.399
 criticism of the figure of women who stand 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:35.429
 and who percent and who flies over the original picture just 7th because she 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.219
 try to avoid getting angry 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:43.359
 the balls more than that duck everywhere for dell and percent 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.359
 montreuil and therefore transpose it 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.749
 in painting this rare form revival in another media be 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.229
 of the fear that pays 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.859
 who motivated them she moved on to another stage ie the I think that 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.609
 the viewer can still believe 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.239
 it can feel a sense of euphoria and fear but it is that the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.090
 scared the latter must be because the fear cereals mandate it's c 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.359
 is a commonplace to say it's the fear of something very specific then 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.579
 that the anguished of there is something much more general it is a form 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.919
 of archeology as well yes because archeology it can be also of 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.709
 to give them an image, that is to say, to look for it in vain we will search 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.349
 the clues of what has been 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 and from there we will build what happened 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.499
 anatomy comes just the same way 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.409
 she has a job 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.149
 the presence a figure 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.289
 when the figure finally in the mines was no longer totally 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.679
 perceptible 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.799
 I'm not looking I'm not in the illusionist the judge I'm not claiming 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.919
 not that what is on the web is the reality 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.689
 the material the quantities of military equipment 8% 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:56.829
 he broke me and finally very very shy of press that fragile 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.079
 and so is there to rally a facility almost finances that are 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.769
 still in a kind of trance festivities that which makes that the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.769
 for proof even sometimes reluctant even 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.359
 in 1890 there are political parties and complete forgiveness oneself company 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.389
 of the sign of the sky which returns apart 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.590
 what could be put forward by the mayor a shoulder but% and the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.960
 fairs they all appeared or almost at the edge of the pond the protesters 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.610
 sometimes 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.629
 I say it too and that anyway 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.270
 while he dominated the same time as me disappearance she is there she is 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.300
 keeps 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
 this maintenance in the sense that there is still a presence 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.810
 sometimes even pretty monumental 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.840
 and that's still good still given table in Europe and elsewhere from 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840
 painting I speak several years back 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.460
 and back and stays and would stay in a presence 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.939
 waiting for other reforms to make a choice 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.279
 but form of kickinger affirmations thousands of negative les 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.059
 acoustics 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.560
 other frequencies repression tradition might just share 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.409
 everyone has their own tradition 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.900
 having said that there were the links that interesting in the case where tradition 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:15.059
 and% security or equipment and his relatives in fact of treason 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.710
 the train to wander to celebrate 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.479
 and in fact treason and traditions have the same root 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.419
 when one is under the influence to the limit I think we must not repress this 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.639
 affluence and it is better still exercising armed 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.689
 will not euro always be totally in the in the 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.719
 poetic affluence because there is always dissipated a betrayal 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.949
 precisely italy worry-free betrayal 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.550
 two tiny essay ended what the gaps finally happen 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.930
 at 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.909
 to something totally different
