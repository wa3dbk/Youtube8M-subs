00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.070
 such a wonderful reason to talk to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 in the end there was a book that should be 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 show here one story will 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 little here's a book called 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 little fairy tale about a hedgehog would like to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.609
 tell you a little bit about how she is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 this book has appeared 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.269
 familiar to all readers of the doctor 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
 Komarovsky here r. 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.050
 a guide for sane parents 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.420
 Here I personally have when I worked on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 this book is having huge problems with 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.329
 spelling and fag 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.920
 here somehow I got so used that in all my 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.030
 books have epigraphs 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.290
 how to come up and pickers in the head 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.329
 additional research methods but 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 it's just impossible she often 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.270
 so it was difficult to find some clever 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.949
 phrase and that's it from chapter 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.899
 additional research methods in new 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.010
 ep for everything started and then came up 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.280
 such text 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 he sounded feather bed so that day to him 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.400
 it was especially bad and when the doctor 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 the badger said to take a few 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.670
 needles for analysis hedgehog could not resist and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.119
 burst into tears and from such small 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 hut stories and consisted all and counts 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.119
 p books for them there were 14 of them and how it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.780
 not surprising but after this 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.040
 books i got over five hundred letters with 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.689
 question who is the author of this 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 a book about a hedgehog here these fairy tales about 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.700
 hedgehog here these epigraphs and requests 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.310
 say all this can be bought and read 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.250
 here actually this mail also served 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.040
 The reason for creating this book here 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.990
 this book of course 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.740
 it is impossible to determine what is more important 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.520
 it is the text that somehow 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 born unexpectedly and pictures which 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.910
 inside here I show everything 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 understood the essence of this book that is here 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.100
 very small text and a lot of pictures 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 and the main thing is the actual reef that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.330
 this book which is nile yes it is just 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.600
 read here actually for each 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.390
 little story is a reason for that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.000
 to sit with the child and discuss 7 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.300
 what do you see here by the way 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.250
 an illustration of that epigraph about 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.890
 survey of hedgehogs here is like a lot 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.780
 really a lot of real reasons 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 be with the child to lead that is really 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.040
 I really would like this book 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.030
 draw your attention to a special kind 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.239
 literature 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.709
 the task of such books seems to me 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.320
 force moms and dads 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.830
 at least some time really stay with 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.230
 by children 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.950
 here is the actual series for this book and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.220
 intended and really hope that together 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.050
 with children she will give you joy 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.840
 extra joy of communication i topshop 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.370
