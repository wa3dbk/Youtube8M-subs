00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 I'll tell you how it works. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.090
 written pronunciation and upe 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.340
 all upe books always have the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 written pronunciation this written pronunciation 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 It's always going to be for us Brazilians. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 done in a special way for us 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.160
 Brazilian really understand what is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.810
 that will be pronounced and also all 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 words have a characteristic that is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.460
 a seat on the tonic syllable 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 it's no use doing do-it-yourself marking 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 Such phonetics are too complicated. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 that the Brazilian catches and speaks English and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.890
 Immediately then focus as speech 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.360
 and will always have it settled where it goes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 speak louder and this is the big 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.610
 secret you hit the correct syllable in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.129
 words such as literature 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.329
 during the year you to be a tonic 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.860
 in Portuguese it is oxfam's own 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 oxygenated paroxitone 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.539
 English sometimes happens until Thursday 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 silas bank that Tony who is a little 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.600
 different 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 the big secret is this in general the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 words that look like Portuguese 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 they are the tonic is a bit behind in the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.150
 English is very important then 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 this throw of the seat on the syllable 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.479
 tonic that makes all the difference to you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 pronounce correctly 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 Good, I'll give you an example of how it goes. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.979
 being in the books overturns the pronunciation 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.290
 writing will give the word has good of the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.180
 The way you write in English in 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 some cases will be translated from the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 right and sometimes not only sometimes 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 left side that is where you have a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 vocabulary and down here the knack of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.900
 talk time always the secret is the beat 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.770
 another example here is the word flower that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 the flower 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 The way you talk, flower, the way you 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.680
 is written in English 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.170
 in general the w has all but no sound 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 right in case it has sound from or 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.310
 can not be carried by rules or by 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.049
 pronunciation tables all stuck 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 You have to learn every word of the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.939
 flower 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.350
 here I gave two examples of words 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.780
 that we have the tendency to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.340
 say wrong then for example the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 word that is the hallway when you go 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.880
 talk about the bus or plane 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.670
 choose the armchair for example then the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.890
 hallway armchair you talk to the belt 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.760
 then the utterance to and fully 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 different from what it would look like 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 the trend is to talk a lot 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.189
 different from what it is actually then 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.349
 person will never understand if you 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:25.099
 speak the wrong one and another example here 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.900
 keyboard or that word on board 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.540
 the Brazilian tendency is to say that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.599
 although none of this is then that board 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 then all the words in the book when 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.099
 You will deal with the vocabularies you 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.079
 will get the pronunciation written this here 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.569
 many people think it can disrupt the 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.430
 writing or something of the learning 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.319
 otherwise it will only be one 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.900
 reference the student will know if here but 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.940
 it will never link writing and will goes 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.590
 to make it easier because you will be sure 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.720
 When you have that written 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.609
 always be that sound and when you have 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.409
 that sound will be that form of 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.540
 writing then it is actually a 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.420
 great facilitator to great 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.950
 some teachers have questions about edict 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.019
 it's because he dies of the student's fear 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.129
 learn how my focus here person 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.379
 learn to have feet and hands to do the 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.090
 things alone so I'll do the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.310
 the better it is that she will learn not 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.949
 will have doubt if you have any doubt 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.949
 cds will clarify when you have some 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.269
 reason I'll give a special tip 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.310
 showing why he talks like this because 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.260
 He does not talk like that and also some 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.730
 sometimes British English or 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.889
 american then 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.720
 have fun with the written pronunciation that 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.519
 There is nothing better you 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.290
 learn in some cases I'll put 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.370
 only songs the caption also for 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 who likes to sing
