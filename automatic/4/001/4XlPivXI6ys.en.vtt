00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.610

 Tuesday night we will be here in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 good trip 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 remembering that in enrolling until 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 tomorrow is 10 from the center 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.109
 at the time of enrollment it will have 10% 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.239
 rebate but come on I'll always 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.229
 keep showing you tips 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.420
 during the year and in the isolated 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.490
 I will show more elements that make 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.470
 part enhances our day-to-day 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.260
 are part of the Portuguese language 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.439
 are expressions that often 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.780
 People think they're right are right. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.799
 and in fact are wrong or expression 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 right wrong expression such as 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 It's common to say it 's her time. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 to arrive 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 It's time for her to arrive. It's time for the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.049
 water jaguar 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.869
 see this construction is the wrong 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.259
 It's okay to say it's time for her. 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.520
 arrive because it's time for an ounce 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.200
 drink water but why the jaguar and her 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.240
 and not hers 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 this is in fact the clear explanation that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 When you say it's time to get there. 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.189
 is what is heard more then that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.219
 listening more becomes correct and that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.939
 which is heard - sounds bad and becomes 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.129
 wrong but it is important to remember that 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.920
 if she's a guy it's time for her 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.650
 to reach who arrives she then becomes 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 she arrives she is the subject of prayer 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.510
 if it is subject and I can not join the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.939
 preposition with the subject subject does not 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.110
 may have this position mainly 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.220
 construction 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.620
 so the set is time for her 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.870
 it's time for the jaguar to drink water and 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 The question is who drinks the water? 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.819
 then the jaguar is what is the subject of the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.129
 so prayer can not be in the hour of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.700
 ounce drinking water it 's time for an ounce 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.920
 drink water then subject value now 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.389
 Man, if I say I'm afraid of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.940
 I can join her there, I like her. 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:54.090
 I can kick it I can not say I 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.760
 I like her so I like her 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.189
 so when I say I like her 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 is completing the verb liking is a 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.120
 verbal complement 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.060
 so I can neither the preposition with 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.739
 pronoun when it was the complement 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 When I say I have need 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.959
 it is a nominal complement I 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 I need it is a verbal complement 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.790
 Oh perfect, I'm afraid of jaguar and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.840
 also the right time is now for the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.329
 ounce arrive 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.549
 It's time for the jaguar to drink this. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.530
 ask the question who is drinking water at 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.329
 ounce who is going to arrive 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.819
 she will never be able to join 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.010
 as for example I listen a lot and see 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.760
 many essays next 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.280
 even though the government acts badly, it is not 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.790
 despite the government's claim that despite 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.540
 the government evil acts who do evil acts 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.000
 the government then is although the government only 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.159
 Are you asking the verb the verb and 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.159
 that the subject there the government does not 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.790
 You can join the the preposition with the 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:05.940
 active the one of the president of the government 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.669
 but if I say I need government 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.159
 then the government becomes a 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.680
 and then you can use 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.519
 quietly unafraid to err 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.970
 the junction of the preposition with the article 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.370
 preposition with pronoun then it's worth it 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.560
 highlight it there was not to confuse 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 subject in addition or join the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.580
 preposition of 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.669
 with neither the pronoun nor the name then 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.490
 although it is time for government 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.660
 arrive and it's time for an ounce to drink 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.780
 water subject and for fear of the ounce 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.350
 I like her, she needs government. 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.610
 supplement then I can join then 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.950
 first tip 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.790
 In a little while we'll be with some 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.160
 other tips 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.550
 so, bye, a hug to 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.550
 all
