00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:05.520
 The Earth has 4 times as shown in the figure even if there is evidence so far 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.389
 It is supposed to have reached the ice age of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.830
 Former Qing Qing period 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.430
 The glacial period that happened to the 750 million pension 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.509
 The most suitable of 16 years of processing 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.429
 It spreads to the equator many times and catches up, and the whole earth is frozen 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.690
 Ball is said to have made ass this story 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.920
 Reputation 600 million years ago in surveys down to the level of Africa just below the equator 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.730
 Trace of was found 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 It is a way of thinking that came out of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.720
 Because of the existence of the trace 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.540
 Evaluation develops to just below the equator 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.550
 The whole state was iced 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 Is being interpreted 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.900
 The story of freezing in the whole was aired even with nhk special 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.490
 From the biologist 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.550
 A place that twists its head from general common sense related to biological evolution 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.900
 There are many 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.760
 It is something that ties up the talk 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.070
 I was impressed that I was surprised 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 Traces of ginger just below the equator move nearby 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.730
 If you admit it is a simple story 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.160
 As shown in this figure, at a certain time around 600 million years ago 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.609
 Current Namibia difference Atari 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.120
 Become a song area 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.539
 Secretary is ready 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.650
 It is just that the glacier had developed 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.049
 Assess the evaluation of the state of the example 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.030
 Moved to the state of b 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.840
 It's a simple story 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.460
 It is not anything if you allow movement nearby, which is the modern bread movement theory 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 One piece of the history of the earth 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.420
 It will be said 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.080
 That there was an ice age- 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.010
 The average temperature of the earth shown in this figure that is the basis is 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.479
 how 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.870
 I do not know if it is being measured 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 Collected at a fixed point 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.159
 If you decide from the data 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.580
 The fixed point is 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.330
 When it comes to the local area 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.610
 Will be estimated camel 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.120
 But if you allow movement nearby, the regions that were polar until then 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.100
 The whole world becomes a bowl of balls because it is warming 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.569
 There is no such thing 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.469
 The sun 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.889
 Without stopping 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.869
 If you are doing a certain activity 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.970
 The reason why the whole earth becomes a snowball 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.470
 It is better to get ms 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.749
 It is difficult 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.979
 Even in terms of the evolution of living things 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.230
 I'm a single man 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.000
 It would be extinct from the earth 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.699
 Freezing all over is an impossible story 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.659
 If you try to throw etc. 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.210
 The trigger of the ice age 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.479
 Atmospheric methane 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.869
 I am not participating 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:40.860
 By it 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 The ice age that cooling is done without greenhouse gas ends 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.939
 I did 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.240
 In a volcanic eruption 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.030
 Carbon dioxide comes out 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.249
 Because it has warmed up 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.709
 An interpretation like an idea will come out 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.200
 In the first place 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.819
 66 years and the year of banana billion years is a daunting time 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.449
 but 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.420
 About 10% 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.270
 Even between 76 million yuan alone 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.820
 As shown in this figure 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.909
 The earth market is 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.549
 1701 times 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.919
 I also have a weakness 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.060
 On average 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.939
 Because it is rate once in 44,000 years 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.670
 It's like a flood of things that humans have 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.420
 Such as the height of the new world only 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.489
 It is a story from a long time ago 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.290
 Once in 440,000 years 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.199
 In reverse 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.029
 Although not due to movement nearby 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.680
 The data to support and support 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.979
 We have a lot 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.879
 Grand canyon strata to any strength 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.579
 like 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.599
 There is something that can only be done on the ocean floor 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.859
 Caves that can only be found on the ground exist at the bottom of each area 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.389
 Continental scale 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.739
 It is proof that there were nine wears and faith 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.190
 In Antarctica 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.090
 There were fossils of dinosaurs, so it was a warm area 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.529
 It is also clear 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.849
 These facts 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.289
 Although it supports movement nearby 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.839
 The ball does not support the ass 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:05.999
 Einstein is 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.019
 Next to the text of a book that is near a shooting holiday 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.649
 I write like 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:12.560
 For the first time 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.859
 When I read a letter from Hachidoku year 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.299
 It is also a fact that I felt a strong shock 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.609
 Hatobut's way of thinking has never been new 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.689
 Very concise and easy to understand 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.200
 If the rarity increases 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.580
 On the regional history of the earth 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.830
 It will be a more important facility than any other section 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.929
 Einstein also gave such a compliment 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.110
 The history of the earth including the mystery of the ice age 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.150
 When it gets worse 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.120
 To be an important road 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.330
 I was aware 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.129
 I think it will be from 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.110
 Solve the mystery of the history of the earth 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.900
 It's not just about fossil age 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.650
 Ten thousand years ago capacity 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.490
 From the history of the earth, it is a steady event like a book 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.319
 Events that occurred at the end of the renewal system 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.249
 Exist in the Americas 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.839
 There is a mystery of the mammoth graveyard 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.020
 The information partner is 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990
 Predict the end of the earth 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.199
 In this 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.960
 Nebraska collects thousands of animal bones in one place 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.379
 I have a place to do 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.839
 Both foal and parents are desperate 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:21.869
 It is clear that one force is acting and the whole swarm dies at once 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:23.309
 It is white 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.150
 An animal named Minamimae 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.530
 Indicates that he died in the middle of the field 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.340
 The evidence is 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.900
 Discovered from within Alaska 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.719
 I mention 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:38.539
 It is a mystery that happened to tens of thousands of books instead of stories like fossils 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.710
 Buttercup flower not digested well 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.409
 Put in 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.520
 Overwintering mammoth is found in Siberia 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.199
 It will be easy solution if you admit the movement nearby 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.490
 Because the income is near medical treatment will cause a great flood 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.510
 Southern 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.860
 It lived in a warm area 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.780
 Mammoth or 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.150
 Other animals 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.240
 Became the Great Flood 24th Period and bore north and made a huge graveyard 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.830
 It is an interpretation 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 The glacial mysteries are also so, and mammoths are also like graveyards 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.400
 but 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.099
 It is called a nearby well 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.189
 Modern van- 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.969
 Do you incorporate geodynamics? 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.989
 Many mysteries disappear
