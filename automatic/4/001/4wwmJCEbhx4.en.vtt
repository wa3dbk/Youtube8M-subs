hope I'm getting a good camera angle on

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.640 
hope I'm getting a good camera angle on
that<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:49.040> right<00:00:49.400> here<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:50.030> our<00:00:51.670> cast<00:00:52.670> on<00:00:53.059> edge

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
that this right here is our cast on edge

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.870 
that this right here is our cast on edge
so<00:00:54.650> we're<00:00:54.860> not<00:00:54.980> going<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.190> start<00:00:55.430> counting

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
so we're not going to start counting

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.150 
so we're not going to start counting
there<00:00:56.200> we're<00:00:57.200> going<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.530> start<00:00:57.769> with<00:00:57.890> this

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
there we're going to start with this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.070 
there we're going to start with this
first<00:00:58.930> knitted<00:00:59.930> stitch<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.850> thats<00:01:01.850> 1<00:01:02.300> 2<00:01:02.690> 3<00:01:04.150> 4<00:01:05.150> 5

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
first knitted stitch and thats 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.730 
first knitted stitch and thats 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:06.890> 7<00:01:07.130> 8<00:01:07.910> 9<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.680> then<00:01:10.550> that's<00:01:10.760> our<00:01:10.909> 10th<00:01:11.210> one<00:01:11.420> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
6 7 8 9 and then that's our 10th one and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.810 
6 7 8 9 and then that's our 10th one and
these<00:01:12.740> little<00:01:13.220> things<00:01:13.490> just<00:01:15.250> slip<00:01:16.250> on<00:01:16.490> right

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
these little things just slip on right

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.630 
these little things just slip on right
under<00:01:16.970> there<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:20.230> close<00:01:21.230> this<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.490> can

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
under there and close this so you can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.820 
under there and close this so you can
adjust<00:01:22.760> them<00:01:23.120> fairly<00:01:23.390> easily<00:01:23.690> we're<00:01:24.620> going<00:01:24.740> to

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
adjust them fairly easily we're going to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
adjust them fairly easily we're going to
keep<00:01:24.979> counting

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.130 

so<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.159> we've<00:01:29.310> got<00:01:29.340> another<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.240> two<00:01:30.689> three

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
so then we've got another one two three

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.820 
so then we've got another one two three
four<00:01:31.500> five<00:01:31.530> six<00:01:31.950> seven<00:01:32.670> eight<00:01:33.240> nine<00:01:33.780> ten<00:01:34.229> and

four five six seven eight nine ten and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.230 
four five six seven eight nine ten and
so<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.740> numbered<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.850> or

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so on so I've numbered them that way or

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.249 
so on so I've numbered them that way or
marked<00:01:39.899> them<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:41.330> now<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.360> bind<00:01:43.020> off

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
marked them that way now to bind off

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.670 
marked them that way now to bind off
this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.369> our<00:01:44.549> last<00:01:44.789> row<00:01:45.509> our<00:01:45.810> 40th<00:01:46.289> row<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and then you're going to have one loop

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then you're going to have one loop
left<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.970> needle<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.500> we're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
left on this right needle and then we're

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.670 
left on this right needle and then we're
going<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.799> knit<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> next<00:02:17.340> stitch<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.470> we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to knit the next stitch and we're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.729 
going to knit the next stitch and we're
going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> pull<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> over<00:02:20.610> again<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:25.560> have

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
going to pull it over again and we have

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.440

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.320 
one now we're going to keep these fairly
loose<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.730> edge<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
loose so this is the edge here that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.509 
loose so this is the edge here that
we're<00:02:30.450> binding<00:02:30.900> off<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.850> see<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:35.160> keep

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
it fairly loose because we want to be

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.840 
it fairly loose because we want to be
able<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.440> put<00:02:37.739> our<00:02:37.829> border<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.370> at<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.670> end
