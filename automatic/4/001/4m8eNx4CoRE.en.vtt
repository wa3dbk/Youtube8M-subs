00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.430
 hello people how are we in a 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.590
 new video here in a world of 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.960
 minecraft as anyone and says 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.349
 title I'm going to show you a mini 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.369
 modification made by me from gutting 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:32.079
 pitbull of the one who changes some little things 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:34.360
 that modify therefore a fight of the pp gone 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.810
 now we are in macro family I'm going to 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.750
 change 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:43.410
 good as well as nothing that says master of the pp 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.410
 full edith what good then I'll change it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.770
 and then nothing healthy food is the best 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.630
 surf back that changes good that does not change 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.880
 nothing in fact have the same textures 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.980
 that the original michael just that the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.080
 change of resolution makes them 32 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.940
 countries therefore of the bytes that what 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:09.820
 original are 88 by 8 so it does 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.820
 Well, I especially like it a lot 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.260
 craft looks better to my liking 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.700
 because nothing really what I modified 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.610
 is in large part are only two things a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.400
 is fire how fire acts in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.759
 us and how it looks on the screen and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 another thing is a little the effects that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 it emits the bow when firing now I'm going to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 take out a bucket of álava and a bow for 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.910
 show them here 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.830
 a hole that disperses the lava us 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 let's go as you can see to go álava 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.400
 only cover is only on one side that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.800
 makes everything much more visible and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.170
 that is not annoying when it comes to fighting 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.510
 if the enemy has a sword of fire 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 or when we fall to the lava 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.690
 so that we apply the effect in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.770
 this largely to me I like or 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.459
 I think it is better because 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.069
 The heat of fighting can fuck us 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 very good and with the bow here we put 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.769
 we stop as you can see it looks there green 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.910
 orange and red which are different 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:27.900
 powers that we have and then nothing that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.870
 like that would be what I told him not to 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.450
 it's a big thing so some who do 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.000
 for a tris tower packs that have 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
 modified the hard standards the swords 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.380
 others that have also modified the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.079
 positions and inventories but it's 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.230
 also especially to me it does not make me 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.510
 much grace there 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.599
 and then I do not like it or I like it more 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.470
 so more original more vanilla and given the 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.670
 I will bring here I'll leave click the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.049
 download in the video description 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.790
 so they can see if they download it 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.269
 so nothing is the contribution that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.989
 I brought them today and then until the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.989
 next video
