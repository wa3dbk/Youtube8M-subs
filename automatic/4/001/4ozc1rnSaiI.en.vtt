00:00:00.438 --> 00:00:06.381
"Quick Change"! Andy, Elidio
and José Luiz will play...

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:09.363
Any couples here?
Do you have nicknames for each other?

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:14.168
- Ritchelinho! - Okay, it's
Ritchelinho, whatever that is.

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:16.929
"Quick Change" works like this:
Every time I say 'change'

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.232
they'll have to change the
last thing they said or done.

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:26.008
"Quick Change",
'Ritchelinho', go.

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:34.206
Finally! I ordered that
pizza half an hour ago!

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm sorry, I had to
deliver on 40 houses...

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.130
- Fine, fine... - My bag was full,
now your pizza is the only one left.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.755
- No, I asked...
- Is it here?

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:54.751
Yes, but they got it wrong again, I asked
for half mozzarella and half ritchelinho!

00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:58.372
- Sorry, we didn't have any pickles...
- Change!

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:02.616
- Sorry, we didn't have any papayas...
- Change!

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:06.907
Sorry, we don't make
divided pizzas anymore.

00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:09.764
So you got mozzarella, which
was the first flavor you asked,

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:12.053
- that's on the pizza places's rules...
- Change!

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.571
- That's on the pizza place's guidelines...
- Change!

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:16.672
That's on the pizza place's library...

00:01:16.672 --> 00:01:20.747
If you go to the library,
there it is, divided by flavors.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.253
- Hey buddy, I didn't even turn off
the bike! - Change!

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.283
- I didn't even turn off the car!
- Change!

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.310
I didn't even turn off the truck!

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.368
Too many deliveries,
I can't use a bike...

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:37.612
You'll get some sliced bread
and make me a ritchelinho pizza!

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:40.445
- That's great, honey...
- Change!

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.383
- Yes, I really like that...
- Change!

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:51.520
It's such a fine day...
Why don't we invite him to eat?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.269
Good!
What do you want?

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:58.298
Look... I want to go back to the
pizza place, I have 40 deliveries...

00:01:58.298 --> 00:02:01.087
- No, I insist...
- Change!

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.147
- No, I really want...
- Change!

00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:06.361
Don't go...

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:10.834
- No, you're not going back!
- Change!

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.564
- You're not going back!
- Change!

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.107
You're not going back!

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.481
You won't cross this line!

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:25.021
- We were going to watch a movie...
- Change!

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:29.202
- We were going to watch rabbits...
- Change!

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.754
We have no patience, son!

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:40.088
- Look... You're asking so nicely,
so I'll stay... - Change!

00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:43.163
- Well, who could deny...
- Change!

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.499
- I really need to go...
- Sit down!

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.166
Take off your clothes!

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:53.245
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:54.592
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:56.115
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:57.352
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:58.864
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:00.263
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:01.658
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.279
- Oh my God...
- Change!

00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:08.423
Take this bra off for me...

00:03:10.752 --> 00:03:13.529
Oh my God...

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.212
Grab the camera.

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:25.771
- I'm gonna film him.
- Let's go.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:28.423
What are you people?

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.665
- Yes...
- What is this?

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.950
Show your ritchelinho now...

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:39.481
- Hi, today is April 18...
- Change!

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:42.340
- Hi, today is May 30...
- Change!

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.299
Hi, today is May 1
and we're going to work!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.687
You're gonna dance!

00:03:56.687 --> 00:03:59.314
- The guys from the pizza place
will miss me! - Change!

00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:03.240
- The guys from the pizza place
will get you! - Change!

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.536
- I have contacts in the police, I'll call
them and you're screwed! - Change!

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:12.079
- There's gonna be a fire and the
firemen will come here! - Change!

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.796
I'll call my aunt who's a nurse,
and she'll bring an ambulance!

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.445
Turn the camera
a little more to the left...

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.747
Yes, yes.

00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:42.320
Suck on this.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.548
- And they say there's no good
stuff on the internet! - Change!

00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:50.275
- And they say there's nothing
on the internet! - Change!

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:52.988
Mom?

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:08.341
If you're thinking about going to Mexico
to become a pizza boy... Think again!

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.545
All this because of ritchelinho!

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:17.078
Elidio, how can you unhook an invisible bra
so well? The audience wants to know.

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:26.394
Look... I never unhooked my own bra.
Because I've worn it just a few times.

00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:32.772
But that's the thing, right?
We take it out when they let us.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:38.780
- And when they don't, you
keep it, right? - You keep it...

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:42.081
