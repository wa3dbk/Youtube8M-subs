the same goals every year we all work

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.460 
the same goals every year we all work
the<00:02:57.700> same<00:02:57.940> thing<00:02:58.330> we<00:02:58.510> all<00:02:58.630> work

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the same thing we all work

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.490 
the same thing we all work
to<00:02:59.920> get<00:03:00.270> playoffs<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.570> final<00:03:01.870> for<00:03:02.050> all<00:03:02.350> that

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
to get playoffs the final for all that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.980 
to get playoffs the final for all that
type<00:03:02.740> of<00:03:02.770> thing<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:04.270> expectations<00:03:04.900> are

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
type of thing so the expectations are

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.300 
type of thing so the expectations are
always<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> safe<00:03:05.470> which<00:03:05.770> expects<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.160> same

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
always a safe which expects the same

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.740 
always a safe which expects the same
thing<00:03:06.550> no<00:03:06.670> matter<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:07.000> you're<00:03:07.120> new<00:03:07.300> old

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750
