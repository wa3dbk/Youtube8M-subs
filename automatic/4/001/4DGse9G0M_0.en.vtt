00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.149
 first year then I left 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.340
 in a more exclusive club in the area 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 Rouen I spent 13 years until 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.079

 I spent seven and a half and then 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.079
 I left January 30, 2012 in Boulogne 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.960
 I'm doing a year and a half and then I'm 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 stunned here this year that month 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.469
 use that remind you of 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 memories bah me meinau it's I 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 kept good memories because 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 times when I came I always won 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.140
 here and it's true it's done 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.799
 weird to come back into the locker room 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 more especially 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.650
 I 've been here ever since 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.229
 time there so it's true it's nice 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 flea papa it was just the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.250
 behind so here it is a little one 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 little wink but now you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.710
 found in the other locker room 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
 that of racing 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.750
 how did you integrate where it was 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.480
 easy for you you already see the world 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.180
 no I knew 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.240
 quickly made a few days that I 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.650
 played against them in league 2 now 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.670
 I am someone finally I arrive 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.890
 easily to adapt to a team by 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 relation to my character etc 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.800
 I am a little I am a little in my 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.600
 good after corner I like to chamber and 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 cdg players start to me 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.150
 to know as you go 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
 starts to be cool but but 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.790
 frankly it was easy 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.090
 players welcomed me with open arms 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.170
 and it went really well 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.490
 inside the locker room that all the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 world gets along well and that you are a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.820
 little bit by playing a pardon role of a 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.470
 cloakroom animator you would like to see 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.450
 there at the beginning it's hard to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.950
 two ways to be able to make 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.180
 jokes that just happened etc but 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.860
 that's it I'm starting to let go 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.450
 little more players start to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 know my personality and they get 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.240
 realize that here I like 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.390
 I like to tease a little bit 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.750
 world and they tease them too so 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.270
 this is a good exchange it's a good one 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.980
 exchange that we are between us Friday 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.080
 last in front of luzenac who make you 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 first steps under the colors of racing 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880
 tell us a little bit this moment webb 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.460
 honestly I was looking forward to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.670
 return to the campus grounds 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.640
 I came back at least 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.850
 luzenac scored the second goal so 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.400
 when the coach has appealed to me I see 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.330
 wanted to show away what I 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.010
 could bring to the team 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.180
 good it's true it was if it's 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.670
 complicated to get into a match like 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.230
 this especially when the team is done 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.870
 lead then especially to home that one has to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.940
 push after months especially more 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.770
 it was my first match so at the level 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.690
 of the intensity of the rhythm it was 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.760
 a little hard at first but I think 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.860
 for a promoted first appearance this has 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.420
 summer it was pretty good 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.370
 we managed to push I think of 2 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.050
 we would have added dim chips have 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.330
 honestly I think we would have brought 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.940
 the three points but after that 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.120
 any case it will be necessary to remember that 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.590
 the team has mental resource 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 and so here are three are matches 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.400
 like that we will have in the season so 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260
 it will have to be used 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.610
 did you feel about 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
 last Friday the contribution of the public 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.510
 especially on this end of the match but 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.680
 me frankly that's what it is 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.510
 what marked me me I had my 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.020
 close on the phone that I would have said 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.060
 right now 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.260
 me anyway when I came back I 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.840
 not know if it's because my father the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.640
 two years and wanted at all costs finally 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.460
 we equalize but me that I am 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.140
 returned I really support public 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.390
 behind us and that's really it 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.300
 really what us what we 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.560
 allowed to equalize I think that even the 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.090
 gina players that they started to 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.520
 also feel the arts audience e and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.810
 which they have like quotation marks 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.330
 shit on it and here after after we 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.260
 we had the success of scoring 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.549
 to equalize and frankly that makes 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.820
 pleasure to have an audience like that my 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.770
 cd first club I know with a 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.220
 with such fervor around around 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.320
 team 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.320
 it's really very nice 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.050
 next saturday you move on the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.039
 hamburg clown lawn 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.370
 a cup of france always 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.199
 special web always has special blood 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.629
 and in cup of France we already saw by 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.099
 the past that there is no small 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.060
 teams in a competition on a 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.289
 match everything is possible 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.120
 and here we know that here in the region 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.310
 strasbourg is the club the club to 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.440
 beat so now it's up to us to 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.960
 be careful and we'll be on guard 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.430
 to not make a professional mistake 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.879
 the most important in matches like 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.409
 that's the respect of the opponent 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.389
 and disregard that it's a 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.849
 lower team to tie play 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.560
 seriously you have a newcomer to 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.780
 strasbourg we've already said so how 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.949
 it's your life a little bit 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.659
 staff had said they were looking for 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.780
 shared did I did a lot of 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.150
 visits I did I go 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.920
 yeah really a lot of visits 19 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.040
 apartments I think so there I 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.180
 found a step in front so I'm pretty 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.740
 happy now I have not yet 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.330
 moved in there I'm still in the center of 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.050
 training 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.040
 so that's why 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.770
 players and a room a bit because 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.389
 I take my time in the locker room I 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.950
 leave game which is later than any 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.620
 the world says I planted a tent 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.340
 in the locker room so here's no but 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.560
 after all is going well my life 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.250
 outside I 'm fine I'm happy 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.020

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.880
 a big city people are nice 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.820
 I did not know the region at all 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.240
 am arab pleasantly surprised by 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.220
 the area and and see and really I am 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.550
 I'm happy to have theater 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.550
 landed here
