okay<00:00:01.260> my<00:00:01.530> second<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.720> day<00:00:03.899> today<00:00:03.959> is

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay my second video of the day today is

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.010 
okay my second video of the day today is
going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> be<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.980> Windows<00:00:05.609> Vista<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.330> your

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
going to be about Windows Vista and your

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.669 
going to be about Windows Vista and your
processing<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.309> your<00:00:08.910> computer<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
processing in your computer so here we

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.490 
processing in your computer so here we
go<00:00:10.889> now<00:00:11.610> there's<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> dual<00:00:12.179> core<00:00:12.509> quad<00:00:13.110> core

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
go now there's the dual core quad core

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.220 
go now there's the dual core quad core
and<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.860> solo<00:00:14.309> court<00:00:14.730> right<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.000> solo<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.690> one

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
and the solo court right now solo is one

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
and the solo court right now solo is one
do<00:00:16.560> love<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.250> quad<00:00:17.490> its<00:00:17.670> fourth<00:00:17.940> if<00:00:18.510> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
do love to and quad its fourth if you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.230 
do love to and quad its fourth if you
don't<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.980> i<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.640> actually

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
don't know that now i have actually

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.429 
don't know that now i have actually
three<00:00:21.810> laptops<00:00:22.020> right<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:24.140> two<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> which

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
three laptops right now and two of which

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
three laptops right now and two of which
are<00:00:25.619> dual<00:00:25.859> cores<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.670> other<00:00:26.820> way<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
are dual cores and the other way the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.160 
are dual cores and the other way the
other<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.230> solo<00:00:28.500> core<00:00:28.970> pentium<00:00:29.970> m<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
other one is a solo core pentium m the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.330 
other one is a solo core pentium m the
one<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> month<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.859> much<00:00:32.130> pavilion<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
one a month as much pavilion and this is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.560 
one a month as much pavilion and this is
andy<00:00:35.960> tyrion<00:00:37.219> 64<00:00:38.219> x2<00:00:38.850> open<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.600> system

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
andy tyrion 64 x2 open up system

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.080 
andy tyrion 64 x2 open up system
properties<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.820> see

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
properties here so you can you can see

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.900 
properties here so you can you can see
there<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.539> 64<00:00:46.410> x2<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.399> means<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
there it is 64 x2 that just means to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.229 
there it is 64 x2 that just means to
court<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.390> dual<00:00:48.600> core<00:00:48.980> TL<00:00:49.980> 60<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.610> both<00:00:50.940> cores

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
court or dual core TL 60 at both cores

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
court or dual core TL 60 at both cores
operating<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.230> gigahertz<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
operating about your gigahertz so I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
operating about your gigahertz so I
suppose<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.719> processor

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
suppose that's a pretty good processor

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.880 
suppose that's a pretty good processor
vista<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.789> 4.8<00:00:57.530> which<00:00:58.530> isn't<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
vista see there's a 4.8 which isn't that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.200 
vista see there's a 4.8 which isn't that
bad<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.920> anyway<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.340> using<00:01:02.640> Windows

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
bad so anyway so if you're using Windows

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.740 
bad so anyway so if you're using Windows
Vista<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.840> solo<00:01:04.110> core<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:05.519> recommend

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
Vista and a solo core I would recommend

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.070 
Vista and a solo core I would recommend
personally<00:01:06.890> upgrading<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.130> dual<00:01:08.460> core

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
personally upgrading to a dual core

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
personally upgrading to a dual core
because<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> solo<00:01:10.530> core<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.520> isn't<00:01:11.909> as

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
because the solo core really isn't as

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.310 
because the solo core really isn't as
powerful<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.780> I've<00:01:12.900> got<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.790> dell<00:01:14.790> dimension

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
powerful now I've got a dell dimension

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
e510 desktop upstairs and it's pentium

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.210 
e510 desktop upstairs and it's pentium
consumed<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.439> three<00:01:22.439> gigahertz<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.070> it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.210 
consumed for at three gigahertz and it's
a<00:01:23.280> solo<00:01:23.520> corp<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.020> only<00:01:25.200> rated<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> 4.2

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a solo corp and it's only rated to 4.2

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
a solo corp and it's only rated to 4.2
but<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.729> fine<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.299> mean<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.140> eight<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
but that's fine I mean you of eight you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.280 
but that's fine I mean you of eight you
have<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.590> higher<00:01:29.520> clock<00:01:29.880> speed<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.540> 2.8

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
have a higher clock speed like 2.8

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
have a higher clock speed like 2.8
gigahertz<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> solo<00:01:32.880> core<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
gigahertz or over in a solo core I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.230 
gigahertz or over in a solo core I
wouldn't<00:01:33.689> worry<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> dual<00:01:35.700> core<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
wouldn't worry about but the dual core I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
wouldn't worry about but the dual core I
do<00:01:36.360> highly<00:01:36.720> recommend<00:01:36.900> upgrading<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
do highly recommend upgrading to that I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
do highly recommend upgrading to that I
noticed<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> tremendous<00:01:39.090> difference<00:01:39.680> now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
noticed a tremendous difference now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.480 
noticed a tremendous difference now
let's<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.540> cache<00:01:43.040> cache<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
let's go into the cache cache of a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
let's go into the cache cache of a
processor<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> process<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
processor is what the process the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.090 
processor is what the process the
processor<00:01:46.920> does<00:01:47.270> before<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:49.100> uses

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
processor does before it actually uses

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850 
processor does before it actually uses
it<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.520> I'll<00:01:51.450> cast<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.140> start<00:01:52.409> menu<00:01:52.560> right

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it like I'll cast the start menu right

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
it like I'll cast the start menu right
there<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.909> data<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> start<00:01:54.720> menu<00:01:54.899> has

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there but the data in the start menu has

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
there but the data in the start menu has
been<00:01:55.200> cast<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> file<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:56.369> now<00:01:56.520> probably

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
been cast to a file right now probably

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359 
been cast to a file right now probably
temp<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> next<00:01:58.110> time<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.469> open<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:58.950> file

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
temp so the next time I open that file

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
temp so the next time I open that file
the<00:02:00.180> next<00:02:00.659> time<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> open<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> start<00:02:01.560> menu<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the next time I open and start menu it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.590 
the next time I open and start menu it
doesn't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> go<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
doesn't have to go and see what I have

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.389 
doesn't have to go and see what I have
in<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> starting<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.710> already<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.189> so

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
in the starting it it's already there so

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.449 
in the starting it it's already there so
it<00:02:05.490> doesn't<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.299> again<00:02:06.360> on

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
it doesn't have to do it again on

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
not really an AMD fan now my thinkpad

not really an AMD fan now my thinkpad
I've<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.030> I've<00:02:21.239> got<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.599> d<00:02:22.080> 61<00:02:22.739> tea<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> on

I've got I've got is d 61 tea and on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.690 
I've got I've got is d 61 tea and on

2<00:02:26.880> 500<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.569> each<00:02:28.140> core<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.770> believe<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.790> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
2 500 on each core I believe I have a a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.900 
2 500 on each core I believe I have a a
mag<00:02:30.420> or<00:02:30.600> two<00:02:30.810> men<00:02:30.959> cash<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.530> each<00:02:31.680> core<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.130> think

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
mag or two men cash on each core I think

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
mag or two men cash on each core I think
it's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> man<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> two-man<00:02:34.650> cash<00:02:35.069> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's a man so that's a two-man cash and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.710 
it's a man so that's a two-man cash and
that's<00:02:35.400> what<00:02:35.550> most<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.880> them<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that's what most of them are now the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.990 
that's what most of them are now the
newer<00:02:37.020> thinkpads<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> t61<00:02:38.850> or<00:02:39.260> for<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
newer thinkpads like a t61 or for a the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.350 
newer thinkpads like a t61 or for a the
x300<00:02:42.780> i<00:02:42.870> think<00:02:43.110> those<00:02:43.349> are<00:02:43.380> available<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.489> 26

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
x300 i think those are available and 26

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.809 
x300 i think those are available and 26
and<00:02:45.630> maybe<00:02:45.780> eight<00:02:46.080> make<00:02:46.519> caches<00:02:47.519> which<00:02:47.550> are

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and maybe eight make caches which are

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.630 
and maybe eight make caches which are
pretty<00:02:48.060> big<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.730> over<00:02:50.730> 512k

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
pretty big so if you have over 512k

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.490 
pretty big so if you have over 512k
combine<00:02:53.640> course<00:02:54.330> or<00:02:54.630> together<00:02:55.970> that's<00:02:56.970> fine

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
combine course or together that's fine

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.440 
combine course or together that's fine
now<00:02:58.500> let's<00:02:58.739> go<00:02:58.860> into<00:02:58.890> clock<00:02:59.310> speed<00:02:59.640> clock

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
now let's go into clock speed clock

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650 
now let's go into clock speed clock
speed<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.370> despido<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.610> processor<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.390> mega

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
speed is despido your processor in mega

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.530 
speed is despido your processor in mega
hertz<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.200> gigahertz<00:03:04.590> or<00:03:05.340> terahertz<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.510> i

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
hertz or gigahertz or terahertz but i

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.590 
hertz or gigahertz or terahertz but i
really<00:03:07.260> think<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:07.790> around<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.090> popular

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
really think that's around and popular

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.840 
really think that's around and popular
yet<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.390> my<00:03:12.390> clock<00:03:12.690> speed<00:03:12.989> as<00:03:13.200> i<00:03:13.709> recently<00:03:14.430> said

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
yet so my clock speed as i recently said

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.599 
yet so my clock speed as i recently said
is<00:03:15.060> two<00:03:15.390> gigahertz<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:16.049> each<00:03:16.470> core<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
is two gigahertz on each core and a

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.849 
is two gigahertz on each core and a
gigahertz<00:03:17.880> refers<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> billion<00:03:19.200> events<00:03:19.709> per

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
gigahertz refers to a billion events per

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.130 
gigahertz refers to a billion events per
second<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.670> i<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:20.970> 2<00:03:21.299> billion<00:03:21.660> events<00:03:21.989> per

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
second so i have 2 billion events per

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.720 
second so i have 2 billion events per
second<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.650> each<00:03:22.799> core<00:03:23.100> two<00:03:23.280> times<00:03:23.519> two<00:03:23.700> is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
second on each core two times two is

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.699 
second on each core two times two is
four<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.269> i<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:24.630> about<00:03:24.720> 4<00:03:25.019> billion<00:03:25.290> events

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
four so i can do about 4 billion events

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.069 
four so i can do about 4 billion events
per<00:03:25.859> second<00:03:26.209> don't<00:03:27.209> ask<00:03:27.359> me<00:03:27.450> what<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.720> events

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
per second don't ask me what it events

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.380 
per second don't ask me what it events
is<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:28.410> google<00:03:28.769> right<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.489> my<00:03:29.670> thinkpad<00:03:30.150> it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
is go google right now my thinkpad it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.150 
is go google right now my thinkpad it's
two<00:03:30.660> course<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.109> two<00:03:31.290> gigahertz<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.040> they'll

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
two course of two gigahertz and they'll

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.050 
two course of two gigahertz and they'll
do<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> same<00:03:32.670> thing<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.269> its<00:03:34.170> rated<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:35.060> 4.7

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
do the same thing for its rated a 4.7

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.240 
do the same thing for its rated a 4.7
under<00:03:36.150> vista<00:03:36.420> experience<00:03:37.140> index<00:03:37.470> i<00:03:37.769> only<00:03:38.100> got

two gig of ram on that computer but

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.090 
two gig of ram on that computer but
anyways<00:03:41.519> that's<00:03:41.730> enough<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.440> i<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.709> 4<00:03:43.950> under

with<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:10.430> but<00:04:11.569> um<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.790> don't<00:04:14.940> want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.630> run

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
with that but um you don't want to run

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.050 
with that but um you don't want to run
Windows<00:04:16.260> off<00:04:16.470> 900<00:04:17.039> megahertz<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.669> mean<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> can

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
Windows off 900 megahertz I mean you can

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.900 
Windows off 900 megahertz I mean you can
see<00:04:18.239> my<00:04:18.389> processors<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.169> forty<00:04:19.530> seven<00:04:19.829> percent

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
see my processors on forty seven percent

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.140 
see my processors on forty seven percent
62<00:04:20.910> 63<00:04:21.419> percent<00:04:22.280> 56<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:23.460> that's<00:04:23.640> because<00:04:23.849> I'm

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
62 63 percent 56 but that's because I'm

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.029 
62 63 percent 56 but that's because I'm
recording<00:04:24.810> which<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.409> screen<00:04:25.740> right<00:04:25.770> now

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
the zero-percent that's a nice process

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
thinkpad and the NC 8230 the processor

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.680 
thinkpad and the NC 8230 the processor
speed<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.490> rated<00:04:51.760> at<00:04:51.850> 3.8<00:04:52.419> inch<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:54.310> theory

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
speed it's rated at 3.8 inch in theory

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.840 
speed it's rated at 3.8 inch in theory
so<00:04:55.690> definitely<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:56.320> dual-core<00:04:56.860> I'd<00:04:57.280> say<00:04:57.639> with

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
so definitely a dual-core I'd say with

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.909 
so definitely a dual-core I'd say with
vista<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.900> at<00:04:59.020> least<00:04:59.200> want<00:04:59.440> about<00:04:59.710> one

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
vista and you at least want about one

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.920 
vista and you at least want about one
point<00:05:00.160> six<00:05:00.430> or<00:05:00.640> seven<00:05:00.910> giga<00:05:01.090> hertz<00:05:01.330> per<00:05:01.600> core

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
point six or seven giga hertz per core

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.770 
point six or seven giga hertz per core
again<00:05:02.740> with<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.010> solo<00:05:03.340> core<00:05:03.730> I'd<00:05:04.300> say<00:05:04.600> you're

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
again with the solo core I'd say you're

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.730 
again with the solo core I'd say you're
going<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> want<00:05:05.230> one<00:05:06.190> point<00:05:06.490> seven<00:05:07.030> at<00:05:07.360> least

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
going to want one point seven at least

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.500 
going to want one point seven at least
and<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:08.860> can<00:05:09.040> run<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.400> unless<00:05:09.850> but<00:05:10.210> you're<00:05:10.360> not

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
and you can run it unless but you're not

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.180 
and you can run it unless but you're not
you're<00:05:10.750> going<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:10.960> it's<00:05:11.470> going<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.770> awful

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
you're going to it's going to be awful

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.290 
you're going to it's going to be awful

to youtube as i am the mormon my other
video<00:05:20.560> it's<00:05:20.950> my<00:05:21.070> second<00:05:21.460> today<00:05:22.890> but<00:05:23.890> so

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
video it's my second today but so

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.240 
video it's my second today but so
hopefully<00:05:25.540> that<00:05:25.690> will<00:05:25.750> help<00:05:25.870> you<00:05:26.050> out<00:05:26.229> this<00:05:26.919> is

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
hopefully that will help you out this is

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.800 
hopefully that will help you out this is
a<00:05:27.280> resource<00:05:27.760> hog<00:05:27.850> it's<00:05:28.240> going<00:05:28.389> to<00:05:28.450> use<00:05:28.600> more

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
a resource hog it's going to use more

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.630 
a resource hog it's going to use more
ram<00:05:29.110> than<00:05:29.580> processor<00:05:30.690> but<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.930> could<00:05:32.229> be<00:05:32.380> worse

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
ram than processor but it could be worse

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.270 
ram than processor but it could be worse
so<00:05:33.640> look<00:05:34.210> at<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:34.510> positively<00:05:35.130> thanks<00:05:36.130> for

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
so look at it positively thanks for

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.310 
so look at it positively thanks for
watching
