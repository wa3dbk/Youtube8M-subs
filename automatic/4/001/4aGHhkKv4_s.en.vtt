with some water so the painting medium

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.460 
with some water so the painting medium
is<00:01:07.680> delighted<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.280> 50%<00:01:09.060> water<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
is delighted with 50% water so there it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.429 
is delighted with 50% water so there it
is<00:01:10.880> then<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> pop<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> lid
