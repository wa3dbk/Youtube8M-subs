all the way up to 5 amps you can supply
that<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.040> called<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.660> I'm<00:00:36.660> using<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
that if it's called on I'm using a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
that if it's called on I'm using a
Stanford<00:00:38.550> Instruments<00:00:39.350> delayed<00:00:40.350> generator

and<00:00:41.120> right<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> set

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and right now you can see we have it set

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
and right now you can see we have it set
to<00:00:43.969> 250<00:00:44.969> pulses<00:00:45.390> per<00:00:45.570> second<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.050> 250<00:00:46.860> Hertz<00:00:47.090> we

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
to 250 pulses per second or 250 Hertz we

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
to 250 pulses per second or 250 Hertz we
can<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.809> delays<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.890> adjust<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> pulse

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
can use the delays to adjust the pulse

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
can use the delays to adjust the pulse
width<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> servo<00:00:52.140> between<00:00:52.530> 1

millisecond<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.270> 2<00:00:54.539> milliseconds<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.920> does

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
millisecond and 2 milliseconds it does

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
millisecond and 2 milliseconds it does
an<00:00:56.340> instantaneous<00:00:56.910> transition<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:57.840> one

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
an instantaneous transition from one

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
an instantaneous transition from one
bulb<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> next<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.160> push<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
bulb to the next when we push that

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.990 
bulb to the next when we push that
button

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
button

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
button
in<00:01:00.660> fact<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in fact we can see that here on the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
in fact we can see that here on the
digital<00:01:02.399> oscilloscope<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> indeed

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
digital oscilloscope we see that indeed

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
digital oscilloscope we see that indeed
it's<00:01:04.049> running<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.439> 250<00:01:05.220> pulses<00:01:05.610> per<00:01:05.760> second

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it's running at 250 pulses per second

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's running at 250 pulses per second
right<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> width<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> 2<00:01:08.580> milliseconds

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
right now the width is 2 milliseconds

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
right now the width is 2 milliseconds
you<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.630> hit<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> button<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.280> we're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you see there hit the button now we're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
you see there hit the button now we're
down<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.820> millisecond<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.960> see

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
down to one millisecond you can see

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
down to one millisecond you can see
those<00:01:13.350> pulses<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.640> spaced<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
those pulses they're spaced as you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.710 
those pulses they're spaced as you
expect<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.110> 4<00:01:16.470> milliseconds<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.310> 250<00:01:18.119> pulses

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
expect by 4 milliseconds or 250 pulses

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
expect by 4 milliseconds or 250 pulses
per<00:01:18.869> second<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.890> we're<00:01:19.979> gonna<00:01:20.100> start<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
per second so we're gonna start it here

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
per second so we're gonna start it here
at<00:01:20.729> 1<00:01:20.909> Hertz<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.470> let's<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.650> down<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.040> look<00:01:23.220> at

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
at 1 Hertz and let's go down and look at

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270 
at 1 Hertz and let's go down and look at
our<00:01:23.520> servo<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.740> let's<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> nice

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
our servo here we go let's get a nice

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
our servo here we go let's get a nice
close<00:01:26.670> look<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> we're<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.330> 1<00:01:27.479> millisecond

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
close look and we're at 1 millisecond

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.240 
close look and we're at 1 millisecond
and<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:29.820> milliseconds<00:01:30.470> back<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.799> 1

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and now two milliseconds back to 1

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.240 
and now two milliseconds back to 1
millisecond<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.229> 2<00:01:34.229> milliseconds<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> we're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
millisecond and 2 milliseconds and we're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.999 
millisecond and 2 milliseconds and we're
gonna<00:01:35.400> try<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> slow<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.799> can

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
gonna try to slow that down so we can

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
gonna try to slow that down so we can
really<00:01:38.250> count<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> frames<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.689> how<00:01:39.750> fast

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
really count the frames and see how fast

00:01:39.960 --> 00:02:10.780 
really count the frames and see how fast
it's<00:01:40.200> going

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.160 

so<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.120> found<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> let's<00:02:12.810> go<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so now that we found that let's go back

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.950 
so now that we found that let's go back
to<00:02:13.440> our<00:02:13.470> delay<00:02:13.830> generator<00:02:14.660> let's<00:02:15.660> go<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to our delay generator let's go to the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.000 
to our delay generator let's go to the
trigger<00:02:16.170> menu<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:18.020> let's<00:02:19.020> dial<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
trigger menu and let's dial that up to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.360 
trigger menu and let's dial that up to
250<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.880> Hertz<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.650> we'll<00:02:22.830> drop<00:02:23.070> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
250 to Hertz and then we'll drop this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.530 
250 to Hertz and then we'll drop this
down

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.360 

and<00:02:26.989> see<00:02:27.170> where<00:02:27.319> I'm<00:02:27.409> going<00:02:27.709> with<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:27.860> now

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and see where I'm going with this now

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.850 
and see where I'm going with this now
we've<00:02:28.549> got<00:02:28.730> two<00:02:29.000> pulses<00:02:29.480> per<00:02:29.629> second<00:02:30.049> sure

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
we've got two pulses per second sure

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.589 
we've got two pulses per second sure
enough<00:02:31.129> our<00:02:31.370> friendly<00:02:31.730> trigger<00:02:32.060> light<00:02:32.329> there

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
enough our friendly trigger light there

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.869 
enough our friendly trigger light there
is<00:02:32.629> just<00:02:33.620> blinking<00:02:34.159> along<00:02:34.430> at<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.670> leisurely

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
is just blinking along at a leisurely

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.720 
is just blinking along at a leisurely
pace<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.689> two<00:02:36.079> pulses<00:02:36.590> per<00:02:36.769> second<00:02:37.220> or<00:02:37.400> one

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
pace of two pulses per second or one

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.539 
pace of two pulses per second or one
pulse<00:02:38.030> every<00:02:38.299> half<00:02:38.629> second<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:40.280> course

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
pulse every half second and of course

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.720 
pulse every half second and of course
our<00:02:40.790> digital<00:02:41.450> oscilloscope<00:02:42.489> it's<00:02:43.489> not

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
our digital oscilloscope it's not

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.309 
our digital oscilloscope it's not
showing<00:02:44.120> anything<00:02:44.360> at<00:02:44.629> all<00:02:44.720> because<00:02:45.140> we've

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
showing anything at all because we've

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.839 
showing anything at all because we've
got<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.620> collapse<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.010> time<00:02:46.220> base<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.640> least

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
got to collapse a time base at least

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.140 
got to collapse a time base at least
down<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.599> about<00:02:48.430> 100<00:02:49.430> milliseconds<00:02:49.879> per

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
down to about 100 milliseconds per

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.720 
down to about 100 milliseconds per
division<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:51.040> sure<00:02:52.040> enough<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:52.489> our

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
division and sure enough there's our

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.080 
division and sure enough there's our
pulses<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:54.620> see<00:02:54.829> there<00:02:55.040> yep<00:02:55.310> we're<00:02:55.579> two

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
pulses and we see there yep we're two

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
pulses and we see there yep we're two
pulses<00:02:56.569> per<00:02:56.810> second<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.069> positive

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
pulses per second we have a positive

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.819 
pulses per second we have a positive
width<00:02:58.940> right<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.420> two<00:02:59.780> milliseconds<00:03:00.109> it's

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
width right now two milliseconds it's

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.680 
width right now two milliseconds it's
not<00:03:01.190> showing<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.640> very<00:03:01.819> accurately<00:03:01.970> simply

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
not showing it very accurately simply

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.990 
not showing it very accurately simply
because<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.230> resolution<00:03:03.890> limit<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> scope

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
because of resolution limit of the scope

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.449 
because of resolution limit of the scope
in<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.420> very<00:03:05.720> slow<00:03:05.930> time<00:03:06.170> base<00:03:06.409> but<00:03:07.069> indeed

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
in this very slow time base but indeed

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.900 
in this very slow time base but indeed
we<00:03:08.060> are<00:03:08.269> running<00:03:08.599> at<00:03:09.310> two<00:03:10.310> hearts<00:03:10.639> and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.630 

two<00:03:13.510> milliseconds<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.590> now<00:03:14.740> let's<00:03:15.070> go<00:03:15.400> back<00:03:15.610> to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
two milliseconds so now let's go back to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.510 
two milliseconds so now let's go back to
one<00:03:15.940> millisecond<00:03:16.830> let's<00:03:17.830> go<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.370> down

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
one millisecond let's go back and down

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.340 
one millisecond let's go back and down
and<00:03:18.550> look<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.910> our<00:03:19.030> servo<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.810> first<00:03:20.050> thing<00:03:20.230> we

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
and look at our servo the first thing we

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.340 
and look at our servo the first thing we
note<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.680> our<00:03:20.710> servo<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.390> has<00:03:22.540> full<00:03:22.900> holding

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
note on our servo is it has full holding

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800 
note on our servo is it has full holding
torque<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:24.190> as<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.610> would<00:03:24.760> beat<00:03:25.030> with<00:03:25.210> 250

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
torque just as it would beat with 250

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.080 
torque just as it would beat with 250
her<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.770> turn<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:27.580> jumping<00:03:27.910> up

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
her you can see the turn it jumping up

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.070 
her you can see the turn it jumping up
the<00:03:28.240> airs<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.680> turn<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> now<00:03:31.360> let's<00:03:31.390> just

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
the airs I turn it and so now let's just

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.190 
the airs I turn it and so now let's just
switch<00:03:32.830> between<00:03:33.430> 1<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.300> 2<00:03:34.450> milliseconds<00:03:34.750> at

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
switch between 1 and 2 milliseconds at

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.950 
switch between 1 and 2 milliseconds at
this<00:03:35.530> 2<00:03:35.950> Hertz<00:03:36.430> rate<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.360> here<00:03:37.540> we<00:03:37.630> go

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
this 2 Hertz rate so here we go

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.950 
this 2 Hertz rate so here we go
what<00:03:38.110> going<00:03:38.320> from<00:03:38.590> 1<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.830> 2<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.510> 1<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.810> 2

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
what going from 1 to 2 there is 1 to 2

00:03:40.960 --> 00:04:17.449 
what going from 1 to 2 there is 1 to 2
now<00:03:41.890> 2<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.310> 1<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:43.500> then<00:03:44.500> 1<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:44.890> 2<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.570> 2<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.690> 1

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.880 

that's<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.760> sort<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.890> interesting

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
that's just sort of a interesting

their<00:04:27.520> performance<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.180> very<00:04:28.210> similar<00:04:28.870> it's

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
their performance is very similar it's

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.680 
their performance is very similar it's
just<00:04:29.860> they<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.520> equal<00:04:30.760> speed<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.570> they're
