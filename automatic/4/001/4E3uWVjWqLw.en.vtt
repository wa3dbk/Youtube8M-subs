which<00:01:09.460> was<00:01:09.700> expensive<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.500> then<00:01:11.800> decided

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
which was expensive so we then decided

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.330 
which was expensive so we then decided

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
contract the local authority were very

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.410

and I think having a good diet is all

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.710 
and I think having a good diet is all
part<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:40.020> that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.810 

while<00:05:44.290> getting<00:05:44.500> ask<00:05:44.740> your<00:05:45.010> school<00:05:45.130> contract

while getting ask your school contract
can<00:05:46.060> be<00:05:46.090> tricky<00:05:46.660> but<00:05:47.290> there<00:05:47.500> are<00:05:47.650> ways<00:05:47.890> around

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
can be tricky but there are ways around

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.610 
can be tricky but there are ways around
it<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:48.910> have<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.360> support<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.470> whole

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
it I have the support of the whole

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.090 
it I have the support of the whole
parental<00:05:51.550> community<00:05:52.060> here<00:05:52.510> which<00:05:53.230> made<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.650> big

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
parental community here which made a big

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.830 
parental community here which made a big
difference<00:05:54.250> there<00:05:54.610> was<00:05:54.700> a<00:05:54.730> real<00:05:55.000> drive<00:05:55.450> for

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
difference there was a real drive for

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.900 
difference there was a real drive for
change<00:05:56.140> I<00:05:56.500> think<00:05:56.890> schools<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.400> want<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.760> do

change I think schools that want to do

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.170 
change I think schools that want to do
it<00:05:58.090> don't<00:05:58.570> hold<00:05:58.870> back<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.530> do<00:05:59.710> have<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.280> power

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
it don't hold back you do have the power

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.970 
it don't hold back you do have the power
to<00:06:01.360> make<00:06:01.480> things<00:06:01.750> to<00:06:01.870> change<00:06:02.140> question

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
to make things to change question
