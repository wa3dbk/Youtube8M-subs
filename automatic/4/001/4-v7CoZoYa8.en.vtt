what we have seen in other phones so you
can<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.320> directly<00:02:01.770> answer<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> call<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.790> can

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
can like directly answer a call you can

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
can like directly answer a call you can
reject<00:02:03.240> by<00:02:03.479> shaking<00:02:03.750> device<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:05.159> can

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
reject by shaking device and you can

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670 
reject by shaking device and you can
also<00:02:05.399> ringer<00:02:05.850> off<00:02:06.090> by<00:02:06.689> placing<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.110> facedown<00:02:07.320> so

like you can clear beaut notification

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.600 
like you can clear beaut notification
when<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.500> panel<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.620> taken<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.190> example

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
when the panel is taken up for example

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.610 
when the panel is taken up for example
you<00:02:20.060> are<00:02:20.090> viewing<00:02:20.299> a<00:02:20.540> notification<00:02:20.870> down<00:02:21.349> and

you are viewing a notification down and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.039 
you are viewing a notification down and
pulling<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.879> it'll<00:02:23.269> automatically<00:02:23.780> clear

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
pulling it up it'll automatically clear

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.690 
pulling it up it'll automatically clear
the<00:02:24.200> view<00:02:24.349> notifications<00:02:24.530> that's<00:02:25.190> good<00:02:25.489> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
want to the stamina to show up then you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.530 
want to the stamina to show up then you
can<00:02:33.260> clearly<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.010> move<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.400> there's<00:02:35.120> also<00:02:35.299> new

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
can clearly to move it there's also new

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
icons for the battery status bar so

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.789 
icons for the battery status bar so
that's<00:02:37.579> pretty<00:02:37.879> good<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.930> these<00:02:39.140> are<00:02:39.440> like

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799

that's pretty good so all these are like
major<00:02:40.519> changes<00:02:41.030> in<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.690> 4.4<00:02:42.440> UI<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.040> also<00:02:43.700> you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
major changes in the 4.4 UI and also you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.160 
major changes in the 4.4 UI and also you
can<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:44.209> have<00:02:44.930> extra<00:02:46.030> settings<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.209> sound<00:02:47.510> so

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
can now have extra settings in sound so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.569 
can now have extra settings in sound so
really<00:02:48.560> interesting<00:02:48.920> stuff<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.340> can

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
really interesting stuff here you can

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.720 
really interesting stuff here you can
have<00:02:49.760> high<00:02:50.030> resolution<00:02:50.599> audio<00:02:50.750> by<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> USP<00:02:51.769> so

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
have high resolution audio by a USP so

you<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:52.940> connect<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.299> USB<00:02:53.329> headphones<00:02:54.109> to<00:02:54.290> this

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
you can connect a USB headphones to this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.050 
you can connect a USB headphones to this
and<00:02:54.680> listen<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.069> Hydra<00:02:55.310> sorry<00:02:55.489> or<00:02:55.640> how<00:02:55.760> cool<00:02:55.970> is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
here in sound and then under power

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.849 
here in sound and then under power
management<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.989> really<00:03:09.560> awesome

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
management you have the really awesome

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.309 
management you have the really awesome
stamina<00:03:10.609> mode<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.269> there<00:03:11.420> are<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:11.720> new

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
stamina mode but there are all new

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.990 
stamina mode but there are all new
settings<00:03:12.799> for<00:03:12.980> stamina<00:03:13.250> mode<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.940> can

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
settings for stamina mode you can

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.759 
settings for stamina mode you can
actually<00:03:14.359> restrict<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.079> performance<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.650> the

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
actually restrict the performance of the

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.800 
actually restrict the performance of the
processor<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.639> you<00:03:16.880> think<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.269> Snapdragon

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
processor if you think the Snapdragon

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.170 
processor if you think the Snapdragon
800<00:03:18.049> processor<00:03:18.139> is<00:03:18.739> overkill<00:03:19.250> then<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.000> can

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
800 processor is overkill then you can

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210 
800 processor is overkill then you can
obviously<00:03:20.630> use<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.560> extend<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.069> battery

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
obviously use this to extend the battery

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.059 
obviously use this to extend the battery
life<00:03:22.430> by<00:03:22.819> reducing<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.690> performance<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.410> large

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
life by reducing the performance a large

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.710 
life by reducing the performance a large
so<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.910> extend<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.329> battery<00:03:26.510> life

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
so that will extend the battery life

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960 
so that will extend the battery life
massively<00:03:27.410> that's<00:03:27.829> what<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.160> sony<00:03:28.370> rep<00:03:28.669> say

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
massively that's what the sony rep say

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.789 
massively that's what the sony rep say
and<00:03:29.389> i<00:03:29.660> hope<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:30.139> true<00:03:30.290> because<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
and i hope that's true because the

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.349 
and i hope that's true because the
stamina<00:03:31.160> mode<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.430> really<00:03:31.730> good<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.090> works

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
stamina mode is really good and works

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.259 
stamina mode is really good and works
really<00:03:32.630> well<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.169> then<00:03:33.919> you<00:03:34.669> have<00:03:34.790> printing

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
really well and then you have printing

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.330 
really well and then you have printing
which<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> standard<00:03:35.989> 4.4<00:03:36.739> feature<00:03:36.950> and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
which is a standard 4.4 feature and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.930 
which is a standard 4.4 feature and
nothing<00:03:38.180> much<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.230> okay<00:03:40.130> there's<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.609> lot

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
nothing much this is okay there's a lot
