of<00:00:36.120> years<00:00:36.329> ago<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.100> decided<00:00:38.100> alright<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of years ago I decided alright I think I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
of years ago I decided alright I think I
can<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.660> comfortable

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
can get comfortable

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.160 
can get comfortable
I<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> linings<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.540> okay<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> don't

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I think the linings are okay I don't

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.920 
I think the linings are okay I don't
think<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> contact<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.430> metal

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
think it's going to contact the metal

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.770 
think it's going to contact the metal
and<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.530> data<00:00:46.739> proved<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.820> before<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and the data proved that but before I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
and the data proved that but before I
put<00:00:49.230> same<00:00:49.440> items<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
put same items in a can

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420 
put same items in a can
given<00:00:51.090> wasn't<00:00:51.750> willing<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.079> accept<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
given wasn't willing to accept just the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.360 
given wasn't willing to accept just the
standard<00:00:53.780> beverage<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.710> i<00:00:56.660> set<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
standard beverage can so i set to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.760 
standard beverage can so i set to
reinventing<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> beer<00:00:59.699> can<00:01:00.000> around

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
Sam Adams Boston lager and it took two

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
Sam Adams Boston lager and it took two
years<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.140> went<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> lots<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.700> lots<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
years I went to lots and lots of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.890 
years I went to lots and lots of
prototypes<00:01:12.750> dead<00:01:13.140> ends<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> end<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
prototypes dead ends but at the end of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.050 
prototypes dead ends but at the end of
it<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.560> developed<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:18.680> different<00:01:19.680> top<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it we developed a different top of the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660 
it we developed a different top of the
can<00:01:21.330> than<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> standard<00:01:22.650> beverage<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
can than the standard beverage can it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
can than the standard beverage can it
actually<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:25.170> patterned<00:01:25.740> after<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.189> top<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
actually is patterned after the top of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
actually is patterned after the top of
this<00:01:27.479> perfect<00:01:27.930> pint<00:01:28.170> glass<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
this perfect pint glass that we

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.370 
this perfect pint glass that we
developed<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.520> enhance<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.689> flavor<00:01:30.990> from<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
developed to enhance the flavor from a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420 
developed to enhance the flavor from a
glass<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.060> top<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.259> flares<00:01:35.100> out

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
glass so the top of the can flares out

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.499 
glass so the top of the can flares out
and<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.430> bigger<00:01:38.430> lid<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and you get a bigger lid on it with a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.219 
and you get a bigger lid on it with a
bigger<00:01:39.750> opening<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.159> does<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
bigger opening and what that does is

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
bigger opening and what that does is
sort<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.259> forces<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.890> mouth<00:01:44.130> open<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
sort of forces your mouth open so that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.830 
sort of forces your mouth open so that
when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> drink<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> Sam<00:01:48.030> Adams<00:01:48.420> can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
when you drink from the Sam Adams can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.380 
when you drink from the Sam Adams can
you<00:01:49.500> can't<00:01:49.740> chug<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.549> can't<00:01:50.790> suck<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.299> out

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
you can't chug it you can't suck it out

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.249 
you can't chug it you can't suck it out
of<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.790> that's<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:54.720> beer<00:01:55.110> to

to the aromas and

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.590 
to the aromas and
the<00:02:03.980> complex<00:02:04.980> flavors<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.970> get<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.480> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the complex flavors that you get in a

the complex flavors that you get in a
good<00:02:06.780> beer<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.200> Sam<00:02:07.440> Adams<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.070> a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
good beer like Sam Adams and that's a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.900 
good beer like Sam Adams and that's a
trade-off

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
trade-off

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
trade-off
