doing<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.349> the<00:01:37.499> legit<00:01:37.889> way<00:01:38.069> because<00:01:38.459> that's

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
doing this the legit way because that's

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.160 
doing this the legit way because that's
pretty<00:01:38.909> much<00:01:39.029> the<00:01:39.270> hardest<00:01:39.420> way<00:01:39.749> in<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.020> most

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.160 
pretty much the hardest way in the most
part<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.999> it's<00:01:41.999> pretty<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.359> the<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
part and it's pretty much the way that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.019 
part and it's pretty much the way that
everybody<00:01:43.409> should<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.099> if<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.880> you're

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
a little confused then you need to

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.349 
a little confused then you need to
repeat<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.039> my<00:01:47.159> steps<00:01:47.429> now<00:01:48.090> over<00:01:48.270> there

start to get this nanotech now I know
there's<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.250> few<00:02:24.459> other<00:02:24.640> ways<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:24.880> know

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
there's a few other ways I know

there's a few other ways I know
something<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.569> skilled<00:02:25.900> players<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.290> gonna

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
something you skilled players are gonna

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.900 
something you skilled players are gonna
be<00:02:26.470> able<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.459> need<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.760> keep

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
be able to do this but I need to keep

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.550 
be able to do this but I need to keep
this<00:02:28.090> little<00:02:28.330> bit<00:02:28.540> easier<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.290> people<00:02:29.380> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this little bit easier for people to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.190 
this little bit easier for people to
understand<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.190> perform<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:32.049> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
understand and perform so this is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
understand and perform so this is
probably<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.769> weirdest<00:02:33.519> ways<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
probably one of the weirdest ways I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.160 
probably one of the weirdest ways I
could<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.000> come<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.209> with<00:02:34.239> you're<00:02:34.930> gonna<00:02:35.019> do

this<00:02:35.290> entire<00:02:35.590> course<00:02:36.280> backwards<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> enough

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
this entire course backwards and enough

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330 
this entire course backwards and enough
to<00:02:37.480> pull<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.230> took<00:02:38.440> me<00:02:38.530> about<00:02:38.680> 20<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.130> 30

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to pull up it took me about 20 to 30

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.240 
to pull up it took me about 20 to 30
minutes<00:02:39.700> guys<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> ideas<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.069> see

here in the map and all you have to do

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.009 
here in the map and all you have to do
is<00:04:03.250> take<00:04:03.400> out<00:04:03.549> your<00:04:03.639> Dynamo<00:04:03.970> activate<00:04:04.870> this

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
is take out your Dynamo activate this

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.050 
is take out your Dynamo activate this
dynamo<00:04:05.410> spot<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.889> then<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.370> dynamo<00:04:06.790> spot

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
dynamo spot and then this dynamo spot

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.670 
dynamo spot and then this dynamo spot
now<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.569> can<00:04:07.810> take<00:04:08.019> out<00:04:08.169> the<00:04:08.200> enemies<00:04:08.560> before

the Booker you're out and once you hit

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.610 
the Booker you're out and once you hit
into<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.970> nuclear<00:04:38.389> facility<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.110> see<00:04:39.500> this

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
into the nuclear facility we see this

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.350 
into the nuclear facility we see this
huge<00:04:40.009> huge<00:04:40.280> rocket<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:41.120> want<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.270> hit

huge huge rocket you just want to hit

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.640 
huge huge rocket you just want to hit
around<00:04:41.630> here<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> even<00:04:42.050> point<00:04:42.259> from<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.470> out

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
around here I even point from this out

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.249 
around here I even point from this out
and<00:04:42.800> let's<00:04:43.009> play<00:04:43.220> as<00:04:43.340> well

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
and let's play as well

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.680 
and let's play as well
this<00:04:45.259> is<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.440> really<00:04:45.740> big<00:04:45.889> rocket<00:04:46.449> on<00:04:47.449> the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
this is a really big rocket on the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.360 
this is a really big rocket on the
left-hand<00:04:48.380> side<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.889> store<00:04:49.160> that's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
left-hand side of the store that's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.770 
left-hand side of the store that's
getting<00:04:49.550> another<00:04:49.759> infiltrated<00:04:50.389> task<00:04:50.599> and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
getting another infiltrated task and

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.029 
getting another infiltrated task and
this<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.050> probably<00:04:51.380> one<00:04:51.530> of<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.650> hardest<00:04:51.830> ones

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
this is probably one of the hardest ones

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.260 
this is probably one of the hardest ones
in<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.190> game<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.460> supreme<00:04:52.729> took<00:04:53.030> me<00:04:53.120> about

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
in the game the supreme took me about

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.170 
in the game the supreme took me about
ten<00:04:53.570> minutes<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:54.320> complete<00:04:54.849> I'm<00:04:55.849> just<00:04:56.000> taking

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
ten minutes to complete I'm just taking

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.310 
ten minutes to complete I'm just taking
a<00:04:56.240> guess<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.539> I'm<00:04:56.599> trying<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.780> be<00:04:56.870> modest<00:04:57.169> here

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
a guess and I'm trying to be modest here

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.860 
a guess and I'm trying to be modest here
but<00:04:57.949> um<00:04:58.099> it<00:04:58.849> is<00:04:59.060> kind<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.300> hard<00:04:59.539> and<00:04:59.720> I

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
but um it is kind of hard and I

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.719 
but um it is kind of hard and I
understand<00:05:00.800> for<00:05:01.160> some<00:05:01.340> of<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.490> guys<00:05:01.580> is

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
probably the air possible because the

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.070 
probably the air possible because the
