 about his own jokes in it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.389

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 Although a used up video is not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.689
 used up videos on easy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.310
 because they are all time favorites and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.810
 not the most natural and most likely 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490

 the care effect is simply mega good that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000

 liebherr shampoo is available at dm cost 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.969
 155 for me that is dry hair 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 best shampoo ever tested and 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.630
 Something is that I needed too 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 is from which the element series 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.770
 the strengthening shampoos for testing 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.259
 get sent 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.239
 as well as the care mask also from the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.530
 same series and I have about it in the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.729
 blog written respectively lena 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.720
 and i have blog post about it together 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.410
 you can write it yourself 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.269
 read through 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.890
 if you are interested in me 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.300
 the two were not products of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 rich enough they smell 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.290
 incredibly good very cleansing shampoo 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.049
 a conditioner but easy for 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 my very dry curls do not have 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.230
 but enough I found everyone 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.370
 for example really really great 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.629
 if that's a bit more accurate 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.980
 you are interested in the blog 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.959
 post the infobox through then I have 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.879
 Two times the free washing lotions 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.709
 of barea then used up you know 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.540
 In the meantime, I also believe how much I like it 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 So it likes that is always on me 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 sink edge and once in the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.329
 shower and use it constantly because of it 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 just the easiest for me 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.840
 to take that kind of mega under it I felt 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.610
 the feeling that my makeup is so right 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.750
 thoroughly taken down and mine 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.150
 skin just feels like that afterwards 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 spacious at any zone easily 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.360
 drying effect but I tend to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 dry skin and it is for me too 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.230
 no case so disturb one with 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.819
 then night care evenings significantly from, 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.530
 nothing more but it does 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.060
 that easily tenses the skin after one 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.910
 the make-up has taken down with it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.980
 but for the 30 to 1 costs 55 cents 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.239
 or 80 cents or something and above all 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.799
 for the cleaning effect it will 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.160
 but always buy again because 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.940
 i still no practical and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.810
 more reliable section of product 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.340
 have tested 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.959
 But I have a hair product of that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.370
 I am very sad that it is 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.420
 it is empty and it is that three 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.700
 shampoo by cor lab by model recommend 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.590
 youtube who own their own 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.519
 dry shampoo collection brought out 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.870
 there are in different 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.609
 Fragrances that have you up 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.709
 Today in London shows I have the 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.810
 smell of london taken with it 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.819
 dry shampoo so much first 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.079
 it smells incredibly good 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.030
 no white film with me 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.319
 left behind even less than the bathroom 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.760
 is dry look where that too 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.230
 very, very dear that she was 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.060
 really still a convincing one 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.250
 easy on the grip of the hair 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.260
 gives the volume and also just that 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 dry shampoo is unfortunately not in 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.870
 Germany available hope that changes 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.000
 still on 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.170
 Let's see where I order online 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.849
 I can because I would definitely 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.930
 buy it and I would be correct too 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.700
 like the others 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.620
 fragrance directions test since ios I have 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.470
 also needed the sensitive one 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.080
 eu of aloe vera of all once by 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.790
 barea the sensitive aloe vera the eu in 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.230
 this mini size that was easy in 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.030
 I did not find my handbag 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.010
 especially convincing neither smell nor 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.630
 scent control warns now especially 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.610
 outstanding it is the long 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.370
 lasting protection deo in the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.960
 fragrance could be from rexona that is 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.120
 one of my favorite deos is calvi 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 constantly when I buy new dna there 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.539
 I just like the smell 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.820
 because it is very neutral and still 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.229
 So it does not smell very good soon 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.699
 with any shape she does not like 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.260
 if you have told him what to me 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.699
 very strong own smell direction 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.130
 then had a few more 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.389
 missed who actually the part 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.460
 someone is trying to find that 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.289
 relatively neutral but still smells good 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.729
 and that's what I think just such a 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.280
 Hair conditioner popped up that is the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.130
 cucumber leaf extract shine hair rinse 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.260
 aunt of or together with the silicone-free 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.550
 and vegan is there at dm but has me 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.840
 I do not really have to be convinced 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.669
 So honestly, that's for mine 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.300
 dry hair is not rich enough 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.370
 been 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.690
 smells quite good but of the care 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.849
 I do not look after them 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.950
 Buy a product on each one 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.500
 case to buy and now after two 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.690
 three years is so great is the course 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.479
 closing serum of the body shop that is 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.160
 my favorite h serum or have 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.510
 So deliver these products to the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.979
 Just walk in the dry hair 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.389
 give this one in shiny and 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.800
 look more silky that it just smells 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.990
 incredibly good and that makes the skin 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.180
 supple and shiny without you finished 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.130
 or make it seem like it weighs 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.110
 I often find other hell 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.729
 In any case, I'm buying after unfortunately 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.889
 a bit more expensive but has stopped too 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.990
 forever 500 75 milliliter but I had 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.210
 that now as I said at least two 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.740
 years if I even longer and that 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.690
 i will definitely buy it and that 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.889
 last product the only decorative one 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.110
 Cosmetic product that I have this time 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.150

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.660

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.550

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.720
 I'm way too bright right now 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.890

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.600
 they are now buying with darker nuances 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.610

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.900

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.640
 Love that is the best I think 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.320
 drogerie concealer it gives over 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.330
 cover can be super nice show 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.060
 makes a beautiful skin without that 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.200
 bacon or gossip looks like and that 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.760

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.410
