the signal is not only specific it's
targeted<00:02:07.510> animals<00:02:07.930> who<00:02:08.020> are<00:02:08.050> not<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
targeted animals who are not on the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.950 
targeted animals who are not on the
plant<00:02:08.890> can't<00:02:09.520> pick<00:02:09.910> up<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.179> signal<00:02:10.390> yeah

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
plant can't pick up that signal yeah

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.900 
plant can't pick up that signal yeah
like<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> telephone<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.460> kind<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.760> an

the<00:02:16.720> Frog<00:02:16.930> may<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.260> things<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.920> say<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.310> those

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the Frog may have things to say to those

the Frog may have things to say to those

individuals that doesn't necessarily

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.520 
individuals that doesn't necessarily

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
want a broadcast to you know the frog

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080 
want a broadcast to you know the frog

of the pond the researchers say the

of the pond the researchers say the
study<00:02:27.460> which<00:02:27.760> was<00:02:27.910> published<00:02:28.300> online<00:02:28.600> in

the<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:31.990> about<00:02:32.170> frog

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the way we think about frog

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.190 
the way we think about frog
communication<00:02:33.460> we<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.450> frogs<00:02:34.780> as

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
communication we think of frogs as

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.030 
communication we think of frogs as
primarily<00:02:35.890> vocal<00:02:36.930> communicators<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.890> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
primarily vocal communicators but in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.950 
primarily vocal communicators but in
terms<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.700> number<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.690> shake

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
terms of just a number they shake

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.480 
terms of just a number they shake
they're<00:02:41.290> really<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.800> know<00:02:41.920> they're<00:02:42.130> more<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
they're really you know they're more of

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.160 
they're really you know they're more of
a<00:02:42.700> shaking<00:02:43.090> frog<00:02:43.330> they've<00:02:43.630> been<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> calling

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
a shaking frog they've been a calling

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.890 
a shaking frog they've been a calling
frog<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.880> vibration<00:02:45.880> plays<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> role<00:02:46.480> way

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
frog and vibration plays a role way

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.850 
frog and vibration plays a role way
before<00:02:47.200> wrestling<00:02:48.130> begins<00:02:48.490> they're<00:02:49.090> using

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
before wrestling begins they're using

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.110 
before wrestling begins they're using
vibration<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.160> multiple<00:02:51.820> life<00:02:52.030> stages<00:02:57.120> so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
vibration in multiple life stages so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.210 
vibration in multiple life stages so
snake<00:02:58.420> attacks<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.990> egg<00:02:59.140> clutch<00:02:59.410> produces

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
snake attacks the egg clutch produces

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.480 
snake attacks the egg clutch produces
vibrations<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.750> embryos<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.800> sense

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
vibrations and the embryos then sense

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.070 
vibrations and the embryos then sense
those<00:03:03.670> vibrations<00:03:04.000> notes<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.630> snake<00:03:04.810> attack

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
those vibrations notes a snake attack

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.290 
those vibrations notes a snake attack
and<00:03:05.260> not<00:03:05.380> say<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> rainstorm<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.430> hatch<00:03:07.150> to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
and not say a rainstorm and hatch to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:16.200 
and not say a rainstorm and hatch to
escape<00:03:14.070> war<00:03:15.070> canton<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.610> caldwell<00:03:16.000> don't

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
escape war canton and caldwell don't

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.540 
escape war canton and caldwell don't
think<00:03:16.510> vibration<00:03:17.020> communication<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.890> just<00:03:18.280> a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
think vibration communication is just a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.060 
think vibration communication is just a
tree<00:03:18.880> frog<00:03:19.120> thing<00:03:19.480> vibration<00:03:20.230> sensitivity<00:03:20.860> is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
tree frog thing vibration sensitivity is

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.820 
tree frog thing vibration sensitivity is
really<00:03:21.550> widespread<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.570> pretty<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.709> know

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
really widespread it's a pretty you know

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.660 
really widespread it's a pretty you know
basic<00:03:24.340> ability<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.090> has<00:03:25.750> kind<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.110> been

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
basic ability that has kind of been

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.850 
basic ability that has kind of been
ignored<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.570> might<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:28.930> be<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.560> much

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
ignored but it might actually be a much

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.890 
ignored but it might actually be a much
