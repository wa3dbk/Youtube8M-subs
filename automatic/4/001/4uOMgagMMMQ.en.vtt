00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
coral and since these are wild clowns

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.520 
coral and since these are wild clowns
they<00:04:28.240> should<00:04:28.419> go<00:04:28.570> straight<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> torch<00:04:29.260> pool

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
they should go straight to a torch pool

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.870 
they should go straight to a torch pool
or<00:04:29.680> something<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.310> hopefully<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.669> can<00:04:30.729> get<00:04:30.820> a
