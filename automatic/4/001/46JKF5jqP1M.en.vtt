but<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.710> isn't<00:01:22.979> assault<00:01:23.430> rifle

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
but it actually isn't assault rifle

but it actually isn't assault rifle
some<00:01:25.409> people<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.580> people<00:01:26.820> thought

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
some people think some people thought

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
some people think some people thought
that<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> Lee<00:01:27.420> Enfield<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:28.020> actually<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that the Lee Enfield was actually the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
that the Lee Enfield was actually the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
is returning from modern warfare 2 and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.790 
is returning from modern warfare 2 and
it<00:02:19.060> was<00:02:19.120> actually<00:02:19.300> made<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.630> France<00:02:19.840> quite<00:02:20.770> a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
it was actually made in France quite a

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.830 
it was actually made in France quite a
bit<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.010> people<00:02:21.250> should<00:02:21.400> know<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.910> it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
bit of people should know that and it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.400 
bit of people should know that and it
was<00:02:23.050> made<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.380> 1978<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.400> present<00:02:25.110> great<00:02:26.110> weapon

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
was made in 1978 to present great weapon

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.940 
was made in 1978 to present great weapon
this<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.930> three<00:02:28.930> worst<00:02:29.080> weapon<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.620> think

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
this is a three worst weapon and I think

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.100 
this is a three worst weapon and I think
it<00:02:30.070> can<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.820> an<00:02:30.940> automatic<00:02:31.390> form<00:02:31.780> I'm<00:02:31.959> not

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it can be in an automatic form I'm not

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.370 
it can be in an automatic form I'm not
hundred<00:02:32.440> Center<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:34.230> looking<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.350> I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
hundred Center on that and looking at I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.330 
hundred Center on that and looking at I
think<00:02:35.650> there's<00:02:35.800> about<00:02:35.950> three<00:02:36.190> weapons

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
think there's about three weapons

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340 
think there's about three weapons
actually<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.000> game<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.390> are<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.720> or

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
actually in the game that are in the or

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.960 
actually in the game that are in the or
three<00:02:38.530> assault<00:02:38.800> rifles<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.489> burst

from 1972 to present this gun is not
really<00:02:52.900> used<00:02:53.170> anymore

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
really used anymore

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.120 
really used anymore
it's<00:02:55.450> kind<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.780> phased<00:02:55.989> out<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.590> some

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
it's kind of phased out but some

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.440 
it's kind of phased out but some
countries<00:02:57.430> still<00:02:57.519> do<00:02:57.850> use<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.180> once<00:02:58.329> in<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
countries still do use it once in a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.479 
countries still do use it once in a
while<00:02:58.570> it's<00:02:58.840> not<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.079> most<00:02:59.709> reliable<00:02:59.980> weapon

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
while it's not the most reliable weapon

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.360 
while it's not the most reliable weapon
but<00:03:01.950> yeah<00:03:03.120> anyways<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.299> have<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.370> augment

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
but yeah anyways we have the augment

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.250 
but yeah anyways we have the augment
think<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> August<00:03:07.570> light<00:03:07.750> machine<00:03:08.019> as

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
think that the August light machine as

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.330 
think that the August light machine as
it<00:03:08.410> wasn't<00:03:08.560> one<00:03:08.709> or<00:03:08.799> for<00:03:08.980> two<00:03:09.100> but<00:03:09.250> they

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it wasn't one or for two but they

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.400 
it wasn't one or for two but they
actually<00:03:09.489> have<00:03:09.790> both<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.480> light<00:03:10.900> machine<00:03:11.079> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
same one from mono over to it isn't a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.550 
same one from mono over to it isn't a
much<00:03:43.860> older<00:03:44.069> version<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:46.170> actually<00:03:46.410> made<00:03:46.500> in

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560

much older version it's actually made in
Belgium<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:47.640> from<00:03:47.880> 1953<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.900> believe<00:03:49.170> to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
present great weapon I think this will

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.580 
present great weapon I think this will
be<00:03:53.940> us<00:03:54.090> single<00:03:54.690> fire<00:03:54.959> also<00:03:55.170> I'm<00:03:55.440> not

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
be us single fire also I'm not

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.220 
be us single fire also I'm not

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
understood sure looking at it looks kind

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.840 
understood sure looking at it looks kind
of<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> single<00:03:58.650> fire<00:03:59.190> weapon<00:03:59.550> but<00:03:59.730> it

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
of like a single fire weapon but it

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.220 
of like a single fire weapon but it
might<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.209> fully<00:04:00.480> auto<00:04:00.690> I'm<00:04:00.840> not<00:04:00.989> hundred

knew<00:04:55.440> what<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:55.650> was<00:04:56.039> so<00:04:56.280> it's<00:04:56.460> actually<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
knew what that was so it's actually the
