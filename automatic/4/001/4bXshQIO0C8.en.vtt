00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.480
 the second one that is down here took her 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.400
 up and down the first one took the 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.259
 third 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.890
 and under the fourth took the sixth and under the 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:25.009
 fifth is to say that what I am doing 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.550
 is making a crossing raising the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.419
 warps that are below and carrying them 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.010
 upwards crossing the words 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.430
 putting them ahead immediately 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.430
 later 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.079
 sorry to the immediately previous 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.449
 now I'm going to hurry 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.970
 once she selects a good 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.110
 amount for solana beta 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.110
 with the plot 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.210
 I place it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.150
 again I continue with those that follow 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.340
 now I'm going to do it fast because I already 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 we explain how to complete the round 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.340
 again 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340
 for solana beta 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.150
 again with the ones that are left 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 there 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.189
 knows 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.340
 and passed the naveta 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.940
 so not so we always leave a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940
 curve 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 and simply changed the comb 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.220
 position 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.590
 and it already occurs only the is crossing 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.579
 i 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.319
 tyrone and we already have the first two 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.690
 gaza crosses made this can be 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.260
 Repeat as many times as you want or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.230
 alternate with cloth or fabric stitches 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.860
 bad card I hope it serves them 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.860
 greetings from graciela and rodrigo 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.750
 he got up to action I compose the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.969
 first warp so that is that of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.219
 up say I put the comb so that 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.140
 the first warp is up 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.750
 took the second one that is down here the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.370
 took up the first warp 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 the down took the fourth he picked her up and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.560
 under the third took the sixth lifted her 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.709
 and went down the fifth then and this 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.709
 way I'm making all the crosses 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.350
 there they have the crosses already made that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.350
 until the end and that's it
