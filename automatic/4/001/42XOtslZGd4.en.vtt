00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.110 
the plant based diet or protein is made
up<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.300> amino<00:03:27.590> acids<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.830> Moringa<00:03:29.700> has<00:03:29.910> all

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
up of amino acids and Moringa has all

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.980 
up of amino acids and Moringa has all
the<00:03:30.750> essential<00:03:30.870> amino<00:03:31.440> acids<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> when<00:03:33.870> you're

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
the essential amino acids so when you're

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.300 
the essential amino acids so when you're
talking<00:03:34.020> about<00:03:34.350> protein<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.890> really<00:03:35.070> talk

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
talking about protein you really talk

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.170 
talking about protein you really talk
about<00:03:35.340> amino<00:03:35.880> acids<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.000> why<00:03:39.120> you

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
about amino acids so this is why you

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.850 
about amino acids so this is why you
want<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.480> add<00:03:39.660> moringa<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.290> your<00:03:40.410> diet<00:03:40.620> because

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
want to add moringa to your diet because

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.060 
want to add moringa to your diet because
it's<00:03:40.980> got<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.280> protein<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:42.000> there<00:03:42.209> also

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
it's got that protein in there also

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.310 
it's got that protein in there also
Moringa<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.100> look<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:44.520> notes<00:03:44.730> here<00:03:44.959> 25<00:03:45.959> x

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
juicing so with juicy what I do is I

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.550 
juicing so with juicy what I do is I
like<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.590> with<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.010> know<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.400> v6<00:04:17.970> or<00:04:18.180> v8

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
like to go with you know the v6 or v8

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.039 
like to go with you know the v6 or v8
type<00:04:19.560> thing

so that means going to have six or eight

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.080 
so that means going to have six or eight
ingredients<00:04:22.750> right<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.789> either<00:04:24.879> going

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
ingredients right so it's either going

to be it's probably going to be either

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.350 
to be it's probably going to be either
three<00:04:29.440> or<00:04:29.470> four<00:04:29.919> vegetables<00:04:30.819> and<00:04:31.060> three<00:04:31.270> or

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
three or four vegetables and three or

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.350 
three or four vegetables and three or
four<00:04:31.599> fruits<00:04:32.099> so<00:04:33.389> let's<00:04:34.389> talk<00:04:34.569> vegetables<00:04:35.199> I

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
four fruits so let's talk vegetables I

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.089 
four fruits so let's talk vegetables I
like<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.479> add<00:04:37.629> like<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.169> come<00:04:38.440> bus<00:04:38.620> cucumbers

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
like to add like to come bus cucumbers

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.680 
like to add like to come bus cucumbers
is<00:04:39.220> mostly<00:04:39.520> water<00:04:39.639> so<00:04:40.180> that's<00:04:40.330> going<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.539> make

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
is mostly water so that's going to make

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.809 
is mostly water so that's going to make
your<00:04:40.870> juice<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:43.240> going<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.479> add<00:04:43.629> juice<00:04:43.960> or

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
your juice it's going to add juice or

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.420 
your juice it's going to add juice or
vol.22<00:04:45.819> to<00:04:46.270> your<00:04:46.449> juice<00:04:46.659> and<00:04:46.870> mixture<00:04:47.430> carrots

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
vol.22 to your juice and mixture carrots

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.189 
vol.22 to your juice and mixture carrots
are<00:04:48.550> sweet<00:04:48.879> so<00:04:49.300> they're<00:04:49.449> going<00:04:49.569> to<00:04:49.659> add<00:04:49.840> a

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
are sweet so they're going to add a

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.540 
are sweet so they're going to add a
sweet<00:04:51.009> taste<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.550> your<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.509> your<00:04:52.539> raw<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:54.400> your

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
sweet taste to your to your raw to your

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.700 
sweet taste to your to your raw to your
juicing<00:04:55.000> kayla<00:04:55.599> is<00:04:55.750> great<00:04:56.020> because<00:04:56.169> kayla<00:04:56.530> is

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
juicing kayla is great because kayla is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.899 
juicing kayla is great because kayla is
high<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:57.039> protein<00:04:57.280> mahayana<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.539> in<00:04:59.199> vitamin<00:04:59.710> C

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
high in protein mahayana in in vitamin C

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.730 
high in protein mahayana in in vitamin C
so<00:05:00.909> I<00:05:00.940> definitely<00:05:01.599> suggest<00:05:01.900> juicing<00:05:02.530> kale

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
so I definitely suggest juicing kale

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.390 
so I definitely suggest juicing kale
spinach<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.960> broccoli<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.800> know<00:05:05.949> these<00:05:06.129> type

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
spinach and broccoli you know these type

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.770 
spinach and broccoli you know these type
of<00:05:06.430> things<00:05:06.580> are<00:05:06.909> good<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.210> just<00:05:07.389> draw<00:05:07.509> on<00:05:07.659> your

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
of things are good to just draw on your

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.689 
of things are good to just draw on your
blender<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.409> it<00:05:08.860> kind<00:05:09.039> of<00:05:09.129> balanced<00:05:09.580> these

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
blender and it kind of balanced these

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.180 
blender and it kind of balanced these
things<00:05:10.000> out<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.270> know<00:05:10.449> sometimes<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:12.039> know

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
things out you know sometimes you know

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.589 
things out you know sometimes you know
there<00:05:12.490> might<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.819> vegetable<00:05:13.120> out<00:05:13.419> there
