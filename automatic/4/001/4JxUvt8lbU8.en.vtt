00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the seven good reasons to eat 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.620
 sect wines why are insects 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 they the future of our diet 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.280
 today the animals that we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.320
 eat consumes 37% of the resources in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 cereals of the planet and are 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.060
 responsible for more than 18% of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 greenhouse gas emissions 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 today we are 7 billion 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 of people on earth but tomorrow we 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 will be over 9 billion 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 so it's time to find more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 sources of protein why the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 insects represents a form 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 feeding resonate the insects get 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 reproduce at a much faster pace 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.969
 argued that mammals and their 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 growth requires much less 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.460
 resources 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 with ten kilos of cereals we 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.920
 produce one kilo of beef or three 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 kilos of door or 5 kg of chicken but one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.840
 produces nine kilos of insects 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 why are insects a renewal 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.489
 natural we like it the novelty especially 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 in a beautiful package the insects them 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 suffer from bad marketing because 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 of their pace but their diversity of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 flavors and textures use a source 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.289
 new culinary innovations can not be more 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.090
 natural 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 why insects feed well 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 because mostly composed of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.310
 easily assimilated protein by 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 our organization 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.119
 insects are naturally poor 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 in saturated fatty acids and the most 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 amazing of all 100 grams of insects 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.520
 covers 100% of our vitamin needs 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.320
 and minerals daily why the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.360
 insects are opening up a new era to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.049
 gastronomy gastronomy based 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.729
 insect 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.710
 we are in its infancy and many 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.990
 great chefs have already been seduced by this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 new field of possibilities why

 do not already eat insects in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.500
 reality more than 50% of the inhabitants of

 our planet is already consuming 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 regularly insects them 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.250
 main poles and in asia and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.240
 Latin America

 insect base dellapÃ© go and the subject 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 delirium naturally has momentum 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 do the test it's unstoppable and like 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.780
 it's good you will make followers then
