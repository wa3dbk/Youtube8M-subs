frenzy<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> let's<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.920> apply

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
frenzy now let's look at how we apply

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.930 
frenzy now let's look at how we apply
this<00:00:56.430> material<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.730> right<00:00:59.730> around

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this material back in here right around

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
this material back in here right around
this<00:01:00.210> drain<00:01:00.570> line<00:01:00.899> we'll<00:01:01.890> stick<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
this drain line we'll stick the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.939 
this drain line we'll stick the
extension<00:01:03.210> tube<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.690> there<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.140> give<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
extension tube in there and give it a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
extension tube in there and give it a
nice<00:01:05.129> puff<00:01:05.760> well<00:01:06.270> angle<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
nice puff well angle it this way and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800 
nice puff well angle it this way and
puff<00:01:07.830> again<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.880> remember<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.450> treating

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
puff again and remember you're treating

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
puff again and remember you're treating
a<00:01:09.930> void<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.549> fact<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.060> may<00:01:12.270> be

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
a void in there and in fact there may be

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
a void in there and in fact there may be
insulation<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.470> wall<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
insulation in that wall so you want to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
insulation in that wall so you want to
make<00:01:14.520> sure<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:14.970> enough<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> material

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
make sure you get enough of the material

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
make sure you get enough of the material
there<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> wouldn't<00:01:17.250> put<00:01:17.310> any<00:01:17.580> more<00:01:17.850> than

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
there but I wouldn't put any more than

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
there but I wouldn't put any more than
that<00:01:18.240> notice<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> kept<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> horizontal

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
that notice that I kept it horizontal

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
that notice that I kept it horizontal
again<00:01:20.880> try<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> avoid<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.439> don't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
again try to avoid this because we don't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.679 
again try to avoid this because we don't
want<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> powder<00:01:23.310> flowing<00:01:24.000> all<00:01:24.240> down<00:01:24.509> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
want that powder flowing all down in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
want that powder flowing all down in
here<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.710> solid<00:01:26.280> powder<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here so you get solid powder out of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
here so you get solid powder out of
there<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.540> wasteful<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.350> don't<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> do

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
there it's wasteful you don't need to do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.490 
there it's wasteful you don't need to do
it<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.360> another<00:01:30.450> area<00:01:31.290> where

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it let's go look at another area where

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.859 
it let's go look at another area where
we<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.799> use<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.159> vert<00:01:32.520> dry<00:01:32.880> flowable<00:01:33.150> bait<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
we can use our vert dry flowable bait in

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.429 
we can use our vert dry flowable bait in
