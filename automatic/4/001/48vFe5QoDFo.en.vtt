00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.609
 or the girls of current generation 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.010
 how are you welcome a week 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.750
 more here to the day nintendo and in this 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.730
 week the day nintendo we will devote 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.350
 a little I would organize the whole topic this one 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.150
 that you know what I told you ago something 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.369
 more or less month that I would like 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 organize some final games to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.270
 mario kart wii online as you know the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.580
 service the official servers the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.590
 nintendo closes on 20 May 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.240
 agreement is not exactly kronos 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.890
 earth but good time we're not going to 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.809
 resort to the last day to record but 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.359
 what are we going to record before then? 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.269
 I had thought and then announced here 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.819
 that this Friday of six and a half 9 and 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.319
 mean I will be connected to skype the 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.999
 that you are then out there free and such 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.519
 we will try to make some games 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.210
 so good then I think that in 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.739
 three hours of time can be recorded 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.959
 several races I imagine and well then 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.809
 I can have material for pleasure not from 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:58.339
 have it stored for a future 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.469
 if the opportunity arises to raise some 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.899
 little as a souvenir more than another 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.449
 It's worth it, we'll do it that way too 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.120
 surely on day 21 that I think it is if 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.840
 I'm not wrong on the 21st is Wednesday 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.550
 literally day 21 that is Wednesday that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.310
 it is day nintendo precisely because 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.200
 surely it would be nintendo of 21 what 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.480
 I will dedicate to upload and some of the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.310
 games that we have thrown online 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.230
 which precisely we record this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.640
 Good Friday agreed for a bit 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.800
 also because how will it be the day after 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.230
 of that closure of the servers as a 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.300
 little for paying tribute to mario kart wii 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.070
 on-line 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.730
 and well I also want to comment is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.400
 important that day 30 May day 30 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.670
 of this month of May mario kart 8 and 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.680
 I already have it booked so almost almost 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.140
 with total security we will have mario 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.480
 output cartridge here on the channel in 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.420
 current generation goes and we therefore 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.890
 several episodes and all the fishing is worth what 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.390
 I also say already so that what 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.000
 you know but the important thing is that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.700
 important is that this Friday we are going to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.830
 make those valero games I extra in 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 is that there are as I say six and a half and 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.790
 half an hour Spanish if you are from another country 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.100
 does the conversion I did it one hour 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.660
 that can also come well to people 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.790
 of Latin America assuming that there 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.370
 someone who is available on Friday 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.940
 that time, that's six and a half to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.620
 nine thirty in the afternoon pm here in the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 Spanish schedule I will be connected 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.810
 valencia 6 of the current generation all 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 continued 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 there will be many people who will already be something 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.470
 surely wanting to participate 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.880
 because the other time there were people who 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.130
 was in addition to being between knew that 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.940
 there will be no problem that good as limits 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.170
 12 runners per race because there will be no 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.480
 I do not think there's any kind of problem 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.830
 for sure you can participate enough 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.270
 people are worth then there will also be what 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 I suppose some colleague 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 some colleague from the environment who will want 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.780
 be told me for example that marc 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.670
 max I could be more fitri 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 norman I ask him because he knew that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.060
 we will also see how we assemble it but 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.610
 good that in any case that although 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.800
 there are people who want to be in almost 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.030
 all well then I'll try to alternate 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.610
 that can enter the largest of people 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.830
 possible it is worth and what was said of the day 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.870
 30 which is Friday we will have there the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.790
 premiere of mario cartridge have in the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 channel is worth so good is a small 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.970
 video that I wanted to do here is worth inside 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.600
 of what is the day nintendo is a video 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.860
 I'm probably short but it seemed like a 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.420
 important enough portazgo 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.940
 to dedicate a video so you know 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.519
 a little that this Friday is the time 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440
 if you want mario kart wii online this 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.880
 Friday is the time now or never and 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.010
 because there are only a few days left for 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.269
 servers are closed and one then to 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.190
 see if we take advantage of there is a 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.200
 some final races a good 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.870
 laughs and what I will do then yes that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.890
 I want to explain it to you 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.840
 is that is to say on day 21 I will go up 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
 surely an episode of mario kart 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.610
 wii online 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.890
 and I do not know when I'll upload the rest of the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.630
 material that stays stored I do not know 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.360
 if I will upload it to the best to Monday 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.910
 next as Monday on line on Monday to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.620
 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Monday the 26th I do not know if 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.940
 I'll keep it for later maybe 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.370
 for when they have already passed 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.680
 several months without online servers 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.600
 mario kart wii then man portal 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.220
 remember those times do not tell 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.620
 ends when we play mario kart wii 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.419
 online then maybe have some 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.950
 There are videos prepared if good because 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.540
 in case we feel like not having it here 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.790
 memory mode in the channel but now 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.990
 I say that mario cartridge we will have it 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.460
 It will also serve us a little 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.160
 precisely as prior as 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.530
 warming up to that departure of mario 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.770
 cartridge in in wii is worth so nothing hey 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.870
 what you said you know Friday 6 and a half what 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.030
 you want, you have the opportunity, you have 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.650
 the challenge after this sets aside a 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.910
 opportunity is a challenge to pass it 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.100
 we'll do team races well 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.330
 we will make individual races the sure 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.430
 that we will also do some battle of 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.350
 portal globes of important to have mode 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.400
 He let the other time it was not bad like that 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.410
 what will we do there is a little bit of variety 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.270
 to have a good time everything in agreement 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.220
 that nothing hears this afternoon we see ourselves with the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.520
 premiere of new series here five and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.520
 half
