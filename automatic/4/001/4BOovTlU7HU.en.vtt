all<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.100> doing<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.940> cutting<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
all I'm doing is just cutting out a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.660 
all I'm doing is just cutting out a
piece<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> wood<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> act<00:00:53.489> as

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
piece of wood and it's going to act as

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
piece of wood and it's going to act as
support<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> pallet<00:00:55.260> wood<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:56.100> going

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
support for the pallet wood that's going

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
support for the pallet wood that's going
to<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> tabletop<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.210> playing<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to be the tabletop and I'm playing the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
to be the tabletop and I'm playing the
underside<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> pallet<00:01:02.699> wood<00:01:04.760> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
underside of all the pallet wood and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
underside of all the pallet wood and
what<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> does<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.650> gives<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> flat

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
what that does is just gives it a flat

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640 
what that does is just gives it a flat
surface<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.909> allows<00:01:09.450> me<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> slide<00:01:10.350> each

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
surface and allows me to slide each

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.609 
surface and allows me to slide each
piece<00:01:10.950> under<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> field<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.409> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
piece under this field and here I'm just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
piece under this field and here I'm just
drilling<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.100> holes<00:01:14.159> full<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.820> water<00:01:15.320> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
drilling some holes full of water to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.429 
drilling some holes full of water to
have<00:01:16.470> somewhere<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> I'll<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.869> mark

lazy susan to match that they will talk

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720 
lazy susan to match that they will talk
and<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.570> I'm<00:02:54.660> cutting<00:02:54.989> here<00:02:55.730> strips

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and that's what I'm cutting here strips

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.860 
and that's what I'm cutting here strips
of<00:02:56.850> cedar<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.420> some<00:02:58.019> pallet<00:02:58.350> wood<00:02:59.690> to<00:03:00.690> match

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
of cedar and some pallet wood to match

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:13.150 
of cedar and some pallet wood to match
the<00:03:01.170> table

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.790 

here<00:03:13.760> I'm<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:13.910> joining<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.690> edges<00:03:15.050> for<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
here I'm just joining the edges for the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:40.380 
here I'm just joining the edges for the
glue<00:03:15.950> up

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.730 

so<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.690> let<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.020> dry<00:03:42.050> overnight

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
so I let it dry overnight

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110 
so I let it dry overnight
and<00:03:43.750> I'm<00:03:44.750> going<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:44.990> trace<00:03:45.290> out<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.120> glass

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and I'm going to trace out the glass

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.270 
and I'm going to trace out the glass
peaks<00:03:47.569> that<00:03:47.720> was<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.380> original<00:03:48.680> lazy<00:03:49.130> susan

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
peaks that was the original lazy susan

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.860 
peaks that was the original lazy susan
I'm<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.490> drawing<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.150> out<00:03:53.239> with<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.450> marker

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
I'm just drawing it out with a marker

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.500 
I'm just drawing it out with a marker
here<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.319> I'll<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:55.090> take<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.209> over<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
here and I'll just take it over to the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.979 
here and I'll just take it over to the
bandsaw<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:58.000> cut<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.120> out<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.600> I've<00:03:59.780> got<00:03:59.810> a

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
bandsaw and cut it out and I've got a

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.770 
bandsaw and cut it out and I've got a
temporary<00:04:00.440> ban<00:04:00.980> salt<00:04:01.310> table<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.970> screwed

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
temporary ban salt table that I screwed

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.460 
temporary ban salt table that I screwed
through<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:04.600> big<00:04:05.600> decision<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.230> made

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
through the big decision that I made

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.580 
through the big decision that I made
onto<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.310> would<00:04:07.580> get<00:04:08.090> rid<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.330> table<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.440> get

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
onto that would get rid of table to get

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:21.620 
onto that would get rid of table to get
my<00:04:10.000> circle

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.870 

and<00:04:22.140> once<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.410> had<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.560> cut<00:04:22.860> out<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.250> just<00:04:23.520> rounded

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
and once I had it cut out I just rounded

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.280 
and once I had it cut out I just rounded
out<00:04:24.000> with<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.210> edges<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.720> round<00:04:24.960> over<00:04:25.260> bit

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
out with the edges with a round over bit

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.970 
out with the edges with a round over bit
at<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> brow<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> ticket

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.560 

then<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.070> was<00:04:33.190> time<00:04:33.370> just<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.880> attach<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.420> lazy

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
then it was time just to attach the lazy

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.020 
then it was time just to attach the lazy
susan<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.890> track<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.460> centering<00:04:36.850> it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
susan this is the track I'm centering it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.450 
susan this is the track I'm centering it
up<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.390> dish<00:04:38.110> attached<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.710> with<00:04:38.860> screws<00:04:39.040> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
up a dish attached it with screws and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.800 
up a dish attached it with screws and
just<00:04:40.050> put<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.140> top<00:04:41.320> probably<00:04:42.070> cover<00:04:42.280> back<00:04:42.490> on

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.030
