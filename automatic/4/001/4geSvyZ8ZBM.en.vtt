00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.660
 the jihadist now knows the number of teachers 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.190
 because he is paying 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.879
 Now we're going to put down some great numbers for the complex numbers 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.259
 was as strong as a quadratic equations on 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.259
 it was the Jerez graduation 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.659
 +8 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:19.159
 nevertheless 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.340
 if not now so for example coveted profitable 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.619
 I also need the breakout 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 6 1 2 the same 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.409
 - 2 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.169
 Plus minus the root 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.820
 - 4 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.130
 UTV sweater 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.350
 Root out - fourth largest 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.530
 but at least we have already clarified that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.360
 where to say must go out - 4 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.610
 2 the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 So he gives himself the solution is equal to 1 2 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 Windows 2 Plus minus 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 2 SID 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.480
 the solution here 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.640
 So it's not a deal 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.910
 which, in turn, consists of an empty number - 2 about one billion he pays 2 II 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.800
 composed 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 therefore such numbers are called such solution here 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.940
 Percent composite numbers 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.410
 which is no advantage for compounding complex numbers means so 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.930
 complex 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.870
 Switzerland was just 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.820
 complex 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 numbers 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.030
 So we have the general form 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 from 01 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.610
 negative 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.750
 Asafa Powell are much more valuable 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 and here comes the team behind that is this feeling 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 while dressing up 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 yes, if you introduced your new numbers ab 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.100
 then it is very desirable that they once contain all the fools Bertram 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.050
 Percent I think that was just 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.090
 for example, when he introduced the integers 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.490
 remind me how to be positive 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.890
 all the time so the natural numbers contain 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 as well as the negative integers - boÃŸ 1 - 2 - 3 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 So the positive and negative once summarized 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.679
 to the whole numbers exactly the same 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:26.119
 we do that now is also desirable that synonymous with the 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.049
 complex numbers the case is the complex numbers are supposed to be the real ones 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:30.869
 sunned 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.639
 Woods lies the matinee on the side panel 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.619
 so that Profumo 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:36.949
 and over Christmas 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.569
 if she really damned that 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.829
 since we have the example currently 4 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.939
 It writes nothing at all even as complex numbers in the complex time 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.189
 Although I do not have to do any fat I do not fight 4+ 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.959
 0 the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.199
 According to the works council, this number results 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.599
 as before with the complex number 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.319
 4 is Assange 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.659
 Now the bed and back of the head is Presley 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.389
 that works already Wolfgang Porsche landmark 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.390
 okay even give violence in Iraq in their time, "says Hamad 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.749
 2 gg 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.149
 is also in complex numbers 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.779
 yes and once properly enters the writes 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.790
 groundless 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.959
 2 the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.439
 and certainly not capable of complex numbers 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.289
 Patience is the "paradise 2" is from b 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.449
 is also a complex thing 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.169
 Tuchel end of the video for the substances to go to the label 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.800
 a complete self but have learned 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.259
 the complex has been completed 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.539
 consists of a real number as Uwe h 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.539
 we give with an imaginary number 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.190
 July who gets paid 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.190
 real part with the mathematician 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.529
 Tepco is now Hip Fergie 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.289
 the brand more part 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.369
 mistakes are often made 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:01.319
 if one says always clarified one can not therefore the whole topic more 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.039
 paid how far go 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.020
 His answer 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.880
 the real number old scheme 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.539
 located in the Airport City 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.149
 this we Wiehl 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:14.159
 So Real and the Matinee Judgment are numbers from him 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.159
 who showed 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.499
 So you have to distinguish 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.209
 "Ayda is more paid for the magic 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.400
 he asked the mathematician but Martin says more part 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 continue only this quake the action that stand 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.400
 complex numbers 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 the price is z abbreviated 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.759
 Platzeck banished 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.759
 That is why real-time is often called 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.930
 and the energy becomes more part 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.719
 abbreviated times in the tent planned 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.669
 so at the end of 50 euros I say goodbye
