00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.549
 Well now we go with the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 Swiss rudiments I'll start with one 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:15.200
 which is equal to the plant times backwards 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.200
 been flat and is 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.789
 on the left 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.830
 this is the plan let's go connection berger 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:39.730
 number 25 that is only are blows of 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.730
 right as if they would have changed like that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.789
 to the left 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.540
 but in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.540
 of these there will be a rock 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.890
 land 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.890
 i 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.929
 then the dredging continues which is very 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:18.179
 similar to those who do not know the 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.179
 for ski free 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.360
 he is a stopped 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.570
 well dredging is very similar 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.020
 only that the first goal but we're going to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.020
 give double 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 is 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.550
 and now well 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.400
 this is the team traga we are going with 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.570
 what is called 5 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.570
 whitmill that is 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.019
 what 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.019
 a pudding 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.080
 with the right forehand strong another 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.080
 right left right and then 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.249
 Y 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.249
 yes 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.290
 up here are the Swiss yields 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.160
 now if you can study with your 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.930
 metronome that is this 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.900
 that's going to be very helpful with this 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.730
 metronome you will be able to take the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.640
 speed to go studying the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 movements at a constant time because 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.590
 the time that one imagines is not the same 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.900
 have the real time the metronome is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.170
 very important to study and here you can 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.050
 slow down faster 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.260
 and so you can go checking in 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.099
 forgiveness daily 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.349
 how much you advance in terms of speed 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:29.200
 and that will also give you more security 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.200
 when playing and more stability in time
