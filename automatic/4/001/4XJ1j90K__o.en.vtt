00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.920 

see<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.280> details<00:01:26.869> um<00:01:28.460> no<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> UH<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.600 

four<00:01:33.930> groups<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.710> camo<00:01:36.140> yeah<00:01:37.610> grain

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
four groups got some camo yeah grain

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.410 
four groups got some camo yeah grain
wasn't<00:01:39.560> paper<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.640> basically

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
wasn't paper so it's like basically

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.230 
wasn't paper so it's like basically
wasn't<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.149> everything<00:01:46.140> else<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
wasn't and then everything else is just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.929 
wasn't and then everything else is just
rainbow<00:01:48.240> camo

rainbow camo

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.950 
rainbow camo
I'd<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.720> grip<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.320> probably<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.960> red

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I'd say the grip would probably be red

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.850 
I'd say the grip would probably be red
Tiger<00:01:55.380> came<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.479> we<00:01:57.479> took<00:01:57.689> him<00:01:58.070> either<00:01:59.070> one

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
Tiger came out or we took him either one

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.149 
Tiger came out or we took him either one
so<00:02:01.860> yeah<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.540> took<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.990> about<00:02:04.259> three<00:02:05.130> hours

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

yeah<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:12.239> making<00:02:12.450> over<00:02:12.989> I'll<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.830> making<00:02:14.190> a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
yeah I'm making over I'll be making a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.699 
yeah I'm making over I'll be making a
version<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.909> right<00:02:15.239> after<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.629> post<00:02:15.989> this<00:02:16.110> Yeah

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
version for right after I post this Yeah

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.440 
version for right after I post this Yeah
right<00:02:17.010> after<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.610> post<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.000> video<00:02:20.450> probably

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
right after I post this video probably

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
right after I post this video probably
what<00:02:21.629> you're<00:02:21.780> gonna<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.459> inversion

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
what you're gonna see in the inversion

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.020 
what you're gonna see in the inversion
for<00:02:23.909> is<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:26.540> charging<00:02:27.540> handle<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:29.370> last<00:02:29.790> time

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
for is a charging handle like last time

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.920 
for is a charging handle like last time
better<00:02:31.580> building<00:02:32.580> stock<00:02:32.879> systems<00:02:33.390> because

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
better building stock systems because

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.830 
better building stock systems because
it's<00:02:34.140> hard<00:02:34.319> dough<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.890> put<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.750> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's hard dough like put it in but it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.990 
it's hard dough like put it in but it
comes<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.709> easily<00:02:37.950> um<00:02:40.040> yeah<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.250> you'll

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
comes out easily um yeah and you'll

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.960 
comes out easily um yeah and you'll
probably<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:43.079> might<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:46.040> matte<00:02:47.040> mag<00:02:47.640> latch

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
probably you might see a matte mag latch

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.720 
probably you might see a matte mag latch
so<00:02:48.870> yeah<00:02:49.799> um<00:02:50.370> thanks<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.299> watching
