month which is really exciting but that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.389 
month which is really exciting but that
also<00:00:37.079> does<00:00:37.380> mean<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.950> hamster<00:00:38.160> cage

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
also does mean that the hamster cage

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.259 
also does mean that the hamster cage
tours<00:00:39.170> won't<00:00:40.170> always<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.130> theme<00:00:41.820> like

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
