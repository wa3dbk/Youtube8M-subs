00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
actually use this deck in standard

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:44.309 
actually use this deck in standard
format<00:04:35.180> as<00:04:35.360> well<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.590> how<00:04:37.370> cool<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:40.310> want<00:04:42.340> for

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
format as well so how cool you want for

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:53.320 
format as well so how cool you want for
plasma<00:04:45.319> energies<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.879> then<00:04:49.879> for<00:04:52.330> double

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
plasma energies and then for double

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.050 
plasma energies and then for double
colorless<00:04:54.669> so<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.849> is<00:04:56.000> speed<00:04:56.330> lugia

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
colorless so that is speed lugia

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.620 
colorless so that is speed lugia
basically<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.930> need<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:01.509> this<00:05:02.509> deck<00:05:02.720> needs<00:05:02.900> to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
basically you need to this deck needs to

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.890 
basically you need to this deck needs to
basically<00:05:05.630> run<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.159> start<00:05:07.430> line<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.970> you

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
basically run to the start line and you

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.399 
basically run to the start line and you
need<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.289> start<00:05:09.560> swinging<00:05:10.039> turn<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:11.199> if<00:05:12.199> you're

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
need to start swinging turn to if you're
