00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.380
 exact 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.449
 b but all boy we are at all there 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.880
 speak played for the third and last 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.240
 episode of epic challenges against ed 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 hector therefore in conclusion you will see me 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.830
 elector that we come who made the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.500
 best final score to see e 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 declare the winner of these challenges 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 epic so I recommend leaving gods 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.730
 comments 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.769
 who you want to see next 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 opponent the most secular comment 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.910
 obviously it will be taken into consideration 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.589
 good for this last week guys 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.659
 we have the right to use any 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.280
 troops any tactics 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.049
 therefore for this last for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.229
 the latter attack decided to use the 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.650
 valkyrie combined with a vigo needle 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:01.140
 we've if we want to call it that a 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.989
 let's see if it will be decent, and I hope so 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 guys then we miss the last two 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 what is the percentage that targets 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.119
 it wo n't be a problem and we will miss it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 also the goal of making a star with 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.049
 a troop that did damage at the beginning 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.420
 I wanted to make an attack with a flaw with 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 many curators only then in fin 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 I told myself if I want to do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 a fairly quick video but not why 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.970
 to me it gnaws my ass but why how 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.920
 see I have no more gems from the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.820
 in the episode of the witches you have seen 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.610
 before 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 I say that maybe it's better if I attack 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.409
 muncipio out using only one 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 so that troop does harm to this 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.300
 chance i guess i will use a small boat o 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.280
 the miur is barbarian I don't know for which 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.500
 reason is no longer perfect here guys 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 this is very easy to do hopefully 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.120
 that has not waited for the ok has nothing 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.070
 so guys, let's wait for ours 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.080
 valkyrie at level 4 face off 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.479
 this municipality should not be a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 problem and overall this does not 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 we will go attacking them now that both 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 days we have not even earned 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.729
 too much so we are okay but even if 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.099
 we have gained too much we must 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.360
 take into account the final data against 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.239
 exact because he does too has done 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.980
 the goal of the 5000 black elixir 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.690
 let us finally see who will be the real account 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.239
 so we expect the winner 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 Our Bashkir does not send two nons 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.469
 2 sent ria that leaves gaps 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.879
 destroy that our gravy boats 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.300
 the perfect murder 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.220
 now I wait for that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.170
 die not on their own so why 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.320
 at least I do more percentage 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.130
 possible and also helps me in 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.290
 in the goal of the percentage that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.270
 we have to think 350 but in the end 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.800
 accounts we'll make it easily or 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.690
 however he calculated quite badly 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.170
 these goals for this one 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.180
 season m ok silo calculated badly I would have 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.670
 had to set goals perhaps more 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.980
 complicated but oh well no guys 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.900
 then I still prepare from the other mark 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 idea and then we guys do the other 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.830
 attack well guys try the three 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.140
 stars against this th 9 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.630
 it seems to me a feasible thing considering that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.430
 xk and the arcs or maybe we can 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.960
 I would really like to try a three 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.910
 stars would be a really nice thing 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.650
 to show well then send the first 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.080
 holy here I hope there are not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.480
 troops in the cast of the clan but if there is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.120
 a perfect troupe nothing 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.130
 a rule I read we will like shit yes 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.450
 he therefore calls normally we all eat 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.230
 our things 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.580
 we send all the excuse of parks 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.350
 he forgot to send her here 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.640
 mandotti splits wall to speed up 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.020
 all the rage send mandola already jump 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.810
 ready here 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.520
 ok no balls break in the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.040
 village so we can go there 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.560
 shave the problem of the Valkyries 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.780
 you know what it is they get fucked 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.540
 fairly quickly from the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.520
 type type like the tower of the sorcerer 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.800
 I know it's a pretty stupid thing but it is 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.450
 so I still do not know a fury 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.670
 not even where to use it awaits the cell 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.050
 I send here so no carmelo sent oh well 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
 does nothing does guys nothing is going 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.190
 they have done quite well already 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.630
 stars here's how you see the Valkyries yes 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.250
 make the sorcerer fuck from the tower 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.670
 not the one with heaven because it gnaws at me 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.920
 ass 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.260
 my ass was a real gnaw 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.580
 of the sorcerer but it is so not boys 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.560
 I can do anything about it 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.360
 takes me all the barriers in one 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.700
 blow even though they are enough 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.700
 rapids but what apples are balls 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.440
 destroying all that pizza and yes or there 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.900
 I thought after one hundred percent e 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.060
 complicated because I don't have the real ones is good 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.550
 it makes you forget that you didn't have real 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.110
 good good so you learn and you take it 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.760
 right there where the sun doesn't beat but 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.919
 however, 70 percent did 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.510
 therefore the goal all the goals 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.770
 we have completed these challenges 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.229
 epics are really very happy 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.470
 of the result miur now we wait for the 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:46.250
 our poor talking so laveno but 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.039
 why but why not like shit life 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.960
 it is possible but that pizza is not there 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.520
 first time guys happen to me that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.099
 balls on stupid good shit game 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.229

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.000
 elector I thank you for having 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.060
 viewed all the episodes you are always 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.139
 all are lost in description 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.580
 especially go into the detector channel 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.190
 who also knows in description to see i 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.840
 his attacks to see his films a 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 factor everything and afterwards handsome boys here 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.120
 here we arrived at the final verdict 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.900
 with and sector that stands next to the 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.960
 nice hello then pay attention and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.919
 drum roll to see winner

 no one nobody has won we have 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.180
 made a draw because I am 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.819
 He failed to make the goal of easier 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.150
 black, on the other hand, sector has clearly done 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:41.180
 so more than me, so are we 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.900

 bad result I'm sorry 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.750
 then 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.669
 now let us put things as they are 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.319

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.889
 thank you sector for having 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.599

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.720
 satan cool 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.330
 it was a goal that seemed more to you 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.340
 complicated of the others no you do is here 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.169
 black what seemed the easiest to me 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.340
 that to aim at the black and in the end it is 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.570
 revealed that a little it fills you 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.630
 file because then in the end I don't have it 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.639
 completed but it was fun 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.139
 from where the mission entrusted was me 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.000

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.960
 perfect so we are all happy
