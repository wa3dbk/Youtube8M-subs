00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.210
 very good since we have these two 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:06.100
 archives in our xperia our ex 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.160
 priego let's go to configuration 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.340
 development options and at least 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.930
 activate the debug option or 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.840
 wireless usb debugging usb 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.370

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.370
 cables with our exterior 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.370
 remember to activate the debug mode 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.370
 so that the club world functions 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.030
 for people who do not know what this is 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.230
 this 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.770
 as we say application that serves with 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.350
 the android phones that are ruth with 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.550
 you can backup your clothes 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.640
 current with everything and buildings is 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.110
 worried when doing backups with two 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.770
 applications when then rooms or so 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.800
 as the man breaks is very good that does not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.230
 we are going to have two files one is one 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.110
 folder that says files and another that says 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.580
 an executable file that says instado 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.120
 we double- click on status 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.410
 will open a little window tells us 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.410
 who is installing the recovery 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.460
 he says he's waiting for our 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.330
 the device 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.500
 you are copying everything 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.150
 in the well 3 and it tells us that it's over 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.260
 press a key to continue or be 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.830
 to exit we press the one we want 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.830
 Valley 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.810
 our xperia and we turn it off 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.560
 otherwise are not so foolish as to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.560
 carry a cell phone 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.440
 because you can follow them 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.490
 digitizer or the protector of the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.000
 screen 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.710
 I am very stupid of monkeys that owe the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.699
 replacement 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.699
 40 dollars 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:37.189
 now let's turn on 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.870
 and when they appear to us after they are and 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.560
 we press the volume minus key 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.560
 many times 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.590
 as I am doing it 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:58.249
 very well that is the same route 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.389
 as you can see, the led flashes blue 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.389
 they can serve very well 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.410
 in its copper center 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.300
 in the recovery you move with the keys 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.849
 volume - and volume more 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.539
 this this program is not touch so 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.529
 you have how to see with the keys to say 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.139
 here 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:29.319
 if you want to make a backup we'll see you 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:33.359
 water copan resort and press the key 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.359
 power off 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.020
 you can make points in the first option 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.530
 that says the cops 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.530
 suddenly 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.639
 and since I already had a boat 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.520
 to restore not only my dear and the 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.160
 receiver 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.610
 and here is friend cup up tells us 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.530
 the date the day the month and the time 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.810
 very good if I want to take 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:05.240
 just press him here with the key 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:09.030
 volume and off and on in the 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.419
 file but as I already did I give it to 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.419
 kovak 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.940
 we're going something back and let's say 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.090
 what we want 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.660
 as he claimed 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.280
 and we're leaving now that we've finished 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.960
 we go to the first option that says the 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:32.070
 new system or restart this magician 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.340
 This comes in English and either in our 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.340
 phone 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.069
 service only automatically 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:56.560
 remember that these beings if you have the 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:59.140
 blocked or unlocked power that I think 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.690
 that there are no unblocked experiences 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.560
 unlocked with the button and that are 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.460
 all right 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:12.020
