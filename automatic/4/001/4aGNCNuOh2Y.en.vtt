00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.040
 today we are going to start I have here a 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 patch of fabric that already cut measures 20 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.039
 centimeters long and 6 centimeters 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 how wide the fabric that I am using does not 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.770
 It is letter but it is a fabric that stretches 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.740
 it can be from some street they have 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.590
 there is another cloth that is called magaly if it is 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.410
 that the purchase comes out at 16 pesos the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.190
 metro and now that with half a meter you 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.680
 many things will come out ok 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.780
 because this style of Russian is super super 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.510
 easy or that the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.579
 is to fold it in half for the part 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.910
 the other way around we have the reverse 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.360

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.239

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.840

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.920
 the neckline they want ok and the other side 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.200
 from here here they are going to be three centimeters 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.340
 I'm going to sew it and I know what I already have 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.640

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.039
 five centimeters and from here here three 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.380
 centimeters 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.659

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.659

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.460
