00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
iphone 6s family and we basically first

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
iphone 6s family and we basically first
saw<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> Apple<00:00:37.590> watch<00:00:37.739> down<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.309> the

saw it on the Apple watch down on the
macbook<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.469> expect<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> spend

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
macbook and then we expect it to spend

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.970 
macbook and then we expect it to spend
to<00:00:41.820> even<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.360> devices<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> force<00:00:43.770> touch

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
to even more devices what is force touch

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
to even more devices what is force touch
you<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.640> simply<00:00:44.850> press<00:00:45.420> harder<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you just simply press harder on the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
you just simply press harder on the
screen<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> able<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.700> discern<00:00:48.480> between

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
screen and it is able to discern between

a<00:00:48.930> light<00:00:49.260> regular<00:00:50.070> tap<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.969> forest<00:00:51.420> touch

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
a light regular tap and the forest touch

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
a light regular tap and the forest touch
and<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> case<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.370> additional

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and in this case it can get additional

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
and in this case it can get additional
functionality<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.110> force<00:00:55.559> touch<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
functionality you can force touch on a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
functionality you can force touch on a
location<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.730> map<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> directly<00:00:57.570> get
