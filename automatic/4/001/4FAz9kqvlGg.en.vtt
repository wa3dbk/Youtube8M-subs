00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 it is really a short time ago 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.089
 to that of valve which he revealed 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 actually launch window 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.219
 of his highly anticipated steam machines that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 together with the controller stand at the steam 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 link and the steam viewer will go to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.529
 completely upset the already large 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 immense offer of the platform of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.340
 gabe newell 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.680
 in short, starting from October 2015 we will have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 what to do with these much acclaimed e 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.400
 long awaited is quite interesting 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.400
 steam machine 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
 today I want to talk to you about innovation 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.680
 that especially these steam machines 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.930
 along with all the peripherals of which there are 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.720
 I spoke before they could have it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 possibility to make inside 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.650
 I did that slice of the market 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 home console in short steam machine 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.199
 a can be inserted between xbox and playstation 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 first of all there is to analyze the price of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.640
 these new gaming machines in short 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 how much they will actually post from 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.290
 this point of view I would say that steam 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 machine loses starting with xbox e 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.729
 playstation since if these two consoles 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 so noble and much acclaimed e 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 spread on the market are found from the 300 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.720
 to 400 euros with a street price more 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.869
 near the first digit to get one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.260
 machine estimation we should spend at least 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 450 euros going up to 750 in short a 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.270
 see it so from outside I would say very much prices 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.900
 closer to a gaming PC than to one 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 consul 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 and this is precisely the point why 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.100
 steam machines are certain computers 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.740
 to have all the peculiarities la 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.260
 comfort of the home consoles of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.090
 so-called living room consoles though 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.680
 as far as the price is concerned 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 regarding the components 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 their hardware's performance is very 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 closer to a PC without forgetting 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 that thanks to this nature it will be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.520
 possible upgrade arles and then 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.930
 update their components a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850
 package that contains the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.400
 peculiarities of personal computers of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.600
 mid-high range and the comfort of all 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.680
 the game consoles we have 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 known so far 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.120
 designed only and exclusively for 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.620
 videogiocare 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.540
 having said this, we must admit 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.090
 that the target of machine estimates 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.100
 right now it is literally to be created 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.260
 because there is no player on 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.390
 console as I was until a few months 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.310
 ago you would never dream of spending 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.260
 all that money for an estimation machine 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.940
 1 because it slams highly gods 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.950
 hardware components so it's not 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.680
 not even to waste time choosing 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.860
 which console to buy secondarily 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.440
 the price of machine estimates is too much 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.440
 high competition with playstation and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.600
 xbox there is not even the classic 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.580
 player on console that is enough 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.170
 the annual exit of the new grand 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.540
 thef car and appreciate in line of 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.160
 maximum the exclusives belonging to the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.470
 console that he owns 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.330
 I don't think he's interested in estimates 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 macini has neither the time nor the desire 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.950
 to be there to study which car to 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.110
 game is the best is so much the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 playstation 4 costs less and I find it 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.370
 under house at the gamestop on the contrary a 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.440
 player on pc who knows about it 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.540
 components would prefer to spend those 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.640
 money always have a way of seeing in a 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.470
 other pc or updating what already 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.080
 he owns rather what he has to me 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.090
 really convinced the austin controller 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 and the steam link peripherals that will be 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.610
 can be used both with the stingono 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.680
 china that without their price will be 55 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.690
 euros each and precisely you can 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.160
 use both if we are in possession of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.320
 a stigma sheen or even with ours 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.150
 gaming pc the first is a controller 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.670
 similar in ergonomics to everything and for everything 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.290
 I would say to those of xbox that mounts of of 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.390
 itself however touchpad technology 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.940
 present on the playstation 4 blog shot 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.070
 in short, a sort of hybrid between the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.000
 xbox one controller is to 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.100
 playstation 4 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.200
 I would say perfection the second the steam 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.500
 link is nothing but a receiver 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.480
 to scream our games on pc on 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 a television around spread around the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.520
 our house obviously all through 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.410
 use of cables or wifi network 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.780
 obviously the quality will not be lost 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.670
 not even in the slightest since apparently 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.190
 matches will run at 60 frames per 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.620
 second in full hd supplanting of for 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.150
 the need to possess an estimate 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.730
 machine if we already have it 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.099
 of a gaming PC 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.830
 to conclude steam machine is not 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.919
 better xbox and playstation 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.540
 at least not for now and especially not for 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.490
 potential on multiple fronts 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.410
 valve platform could remain 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.690
 backward to competitors a 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.370
 starting right from the price but not only 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.960
 also marketing campaigns in the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.740
 particularly that of sony that is 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.610
 literally, they have now become mammoth 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.560
 monopolized the attention of the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.080
 gamers who do not inform themselves 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520
 on supposedly specialized sites 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.260
 they won't even know about existence 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.669
 of machine estimates 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.610
 certainly the papers in order to become 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.830
 a valid alternative to the market therefore 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.510
 to xbox and playstation 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.400
 there are all of them but for now I'm not 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 I feel to say that it is the same 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.630
 height of microsoft and sony 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.610
 at least not on that slice of the market e 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.229
 what do you think you are confident in 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.910
 against those machine estimates 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.130
 reputed to be losing losers 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.080
 obviously guys let me know here 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.419
 below with a comment and tell me yours 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.169
 in short, we create a beautiful as usual

 Hello
