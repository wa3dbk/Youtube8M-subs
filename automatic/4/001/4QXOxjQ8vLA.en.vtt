at<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.260> other<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:15.090> quick

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
at this other side so that it's as quick

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
at this other side so that it's as quick
as<00:01:15.630> possible<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.710> basically<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.369> i<00:01:17.400> mean<00:01:17.640> by

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
as possible so basically what i mean by

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.719 
as possible so basically what i mean by
that<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.630> i<00:01:19.080> were<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:20.280> keep<00:01:20.520> on

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that is if i were to just keep on

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
that is if i were to just keep on
continuing<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
continuing from here all the way back to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
continuing from here all the way back to
that<00:01:23.220> basically<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that basically they had to do on that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.460 
that basically they had to do on that
full<00:01:25.560> round<00:01:25.950> again<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> chest

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
full round again and get into that chest

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
full round again and get into that chest
but<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> does<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.090> if

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but now what it does is pretty much if

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
but now what it does is pretty much if
given<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.159> goes<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.790> way

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
given at this side it goes that way

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
damn easy actually I'm every block let's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
damn easy actually I'm every block let's
just<00:01:52.649> place<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> block<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.520> top<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.299> every

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
just place a block on top it over every

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.969 
just place a block on top it over every
cross<00:01:55.320> basically<00:01:56.130> every<00:01:56.790> block<00:01:57.149> um<00:01:57.979> gap

Breton repeat it so just make this gross

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700 
Breton repeat it so just make this gross
and<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.100> warm<00:02:05.490> blog<00:02:05.729> higher<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.409> place<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and make it warm blog higher and place a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160 
and make it warm blog higher and place a
redstone<00:02:07.950> repeater<00:02:08.520> against<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:09.270> side<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
redstone repeater against each side that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.610 
redstone repeater against each side that
it<00:02:10.379> makes<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.670> key<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.970> Brown

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it makes like kind of a key I Brown

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.250 
it makes like kind of a key I Brown
shape<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.250> now<00:02:13.940> remove<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> blocks<00:02:14.900> again

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
shape and now remove the blocks again

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.550 
shape and now remove the blocks again
and<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.310> need<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.489> do<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:18.170> guy

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and what you need to do now is this guy

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.070 
and what you need to do now is this guy
is<00:02:18.860> facing<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.610> way<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.720> need<00:02:20.930> to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
is facing this way and you need to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.830 
is facing this way and you need to
output<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.220> basically<00:02:22.730> go<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.480> right

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
output it so basically go to the right

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.830 
output it so basically go to the right
and<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.590> every<00:02:25.010> dad<00:02:25.519> every<00:02:26.209> side<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.810> just

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and do every dad every side so just

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.500 
and do every dad every side so just
output<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.950> every<00:02:28.310> side<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.970> cross<00:02:29.239> and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
output it at every side of the cross and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.020 
output it at every side of the cross and
pretty<00:02:30.170> much<00:02:30.230> you're<00:02:30.680> set<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.370> what<00:02:31.909> you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
pretty much you're set for that what you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.289 
pretty much you're set for that what you
need<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.299> do<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.129> use<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.340> billing<00:02:34.879> buck<00:02:35.060> for

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
need to do now is use a billing buck for

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.240 
need to do now is use a billing buck for
your<00:02:35.420> choice<00:02:35.690> i<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> use<00:02:36.290> sandstone<00:02:37.010> just

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
your choice i like to use sandstone just

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.000 
your choice i like to use sandstone just
because<00:02:37.489> unlike<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.200> contrasts<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.379> color<00:02:39.890> of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
because unlike the contrasts or color of

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.789 
because unlike the contrasts or color of
that<00:02:40.549> block<00:02:40.849> but<00:02:41.540> just<00:02:42.079> place<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.319> block<00:02:42.620> in

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
that block but just place a block in

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.490 
that block but just place a block in
each<00:02:43.190> side<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:43.970> cross<00:02:44.390> again<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:44.989> against

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
each side of the cross again at against

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.610 
each side of the cross again at against
the<00:02:45.620> redstone<00:02:46.099> repeater<00:02:47.049> after<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.230> plays<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the redstone repeater after that plays a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.949 
the redstone repeater after that plays a
restaurant<00:02:49.280> torch<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.670> each<00:02:49.910> one<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.660> these

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
restaurant torch of each one of these

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.390 
restaurant torch of each one of these
blocks<00:02:51.349> with<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.310> block<00:02:53.269> on<00:02:53.299> top<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.989> that

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
blocks with a block on top of that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800 
blocks with a block on top of that
redstone<00:02:55.400> torch<00:02:57.549> like<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.819> now<00:02:59.329> place<00:02:59.629> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
redstone torch like that now place a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.190 
redstone torch like that now place a
redstone<00:03:00.019> torch<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.920> eats<00:03:01.159> each<00:03:01.970> side<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
redstone torch it eats each side of the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.440 
redstone torch it eats each side of the
block<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.799> place<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.849> piston<00:03:05.359> facing<00:03:05.720> down<00:03:06.200> at

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
block and place a piston facing down at

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.280 
block and place a piston facing down at
every<00:03:08.450> redstone<00:03:09.319> torch<00:03:10.480> facing<00:03:11.480> down<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:12.049> top

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
every redstone torch facing down on top

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.280 
every redstone torch facing down on top
of<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.650> dirt<00:03:13.340> blocks<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.049> fortunately<00:03:15.049> now

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
of the dirt blocks and fortunately now

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.949 
of the dirt blocks and fortunately now
is<00:03:15.560> glass<00:03:16.069> you<00:03:16.400> need<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.849> last<00:03:17.150> since<00:03:17.599> it's

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
is glass you need the last since it's

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.620 
is glass you need the last since it's
not<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.470> solid<00:03:19.069> block<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.579> pretty<00:03:20.090> much<00:03:20.150> when

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
not a solid block and pretty much when

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.220 
not a solid block and pretty much when
you<00:03:20.750> place<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.169> here<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.829> had<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:22.370> redstone

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
you place it here and I had a redstone

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.659 
you place it here and I had a redstone
going<00:03:24.230> through<00:03:24.560> as<00:03:24.889> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.099> tell<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:25.579> not

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
going through as you can tell it's not

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.330 
going through as you can tell it's not
going<00:03:26.120> through<00:03:26.569> this<00:03:26.810> as<00:03:27.019> well<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.440> that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
going through this as well and that

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.670 
going through this as well and that
would<00:03:28.579> have<00:03:28.730> happened<00:03:28.970> if<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.629> would<00:03:30.019> place<00:03:30.410> a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
would have happened if I would place a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.830 
would have happened if I would place a
dirt<00:03:30.950> block<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.790> as<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.209> tell<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.569> gives

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
dirt block so as you can tell it gives

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.789 
dirt block so as you can tell it gives
and<00:03:33.310> powers<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.459> block<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:36.079> redstone

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
and powers the block and this redstone

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.770 
and powers the block and this redstone
repeater<00:03:37.220> but<00:03:37.549> if<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.819> remove<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.450> place<00:03:38.750> a

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
repeater but if I remove it and place a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.289 
repeater but if I remove it and place a
glass<00:03:39.230> block<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.799> does<00:03:40.280> not<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.060> why

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
glass block it does not so that's why

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.259 
glass block it does not so that's why
you<00:03:41.359> need<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.870> use<00:03:42.109> glass<00:03:42.680> blocks<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.790> actually

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you need to use glass blocks to actually

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.349 
you need to use glass blocks to actually
break<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.660> melons<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.250> pretty<00:03:46.879> much<00:03:47.000> you're

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
break the melons so pretty much you're

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.059 
break the melons so pretty much you're
almost<00:03:47.629> done<00:03:47.989> all<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.379> need<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.680> do<00:03:48.829> now<00:03:49.040> is

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
almost done all you need to do now is

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.059 
almost done all you need to do now is
let<00:03:49.730> me<00:03:49.849> remove<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.359> torch<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.049> show<00:03:52.010> you

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
let me remove that torch and show you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.770 
let me remove that torch and show you
what<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.430> need<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.669> do<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:53.269> place<00:03:53.540> a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
what you need to do just place a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.080 
what you need to do just place a
redstone<00:03:54.019> torch<00:03:54.379> in<00:03:55.010> front<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.730> every

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
redstone torch in front of every

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.839 
redstone torch in front of every
repeater<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.139> is<00:03:57.319> facing<00:03:57.889> into<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.459> cross

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
repeater that is facing into the cross

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.979 
repeater that is facing into the cross
so<00:03:59.120> not<00:03:59.359> out<00:03:59.599> but<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.310> over<00:04:01.579> here<00:04:01.879> over<00:04:02.690> here

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
so not out but in so over here over here

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.800 
so not out but in so over here over here
and<00:04:03.260> you're<00:04:03.769> done<00:04:04.209> that's<00:04:05.209> pretty<00:04:05.599> much<00:04:05.750> it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and you're done that's pretty much it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.339 
and you're done that's pretty much it
now<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:07.099> need<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.459> wait<00:04:07.730> for<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.480> melon<00:04:09.169> to

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
now you need to wait for the melon to
