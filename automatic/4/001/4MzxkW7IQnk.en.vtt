I<00:02:19.490> asked<00:02:19.820> my<00:02:19.880> husband<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.420> he<00:02:20.600> wanted<00:02:20.870> a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
I asked my husband if he wanted a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.560 
I asked my husband if he wanted a
sandwich<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.280> he<00:02:22.460> said<00:02:22.670> yes<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.360> I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
sandwich and and he said yes and so I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.960

made<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.350> for<00:02:24.620> him<00:02:24.860> exactly<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.490> same<00:02:25.730> way

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
made one for him exactly the same way

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.300 
made one for him exactly the same way
and<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.270> handed<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.990> him<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.320> he<00:02:27.380> said<00:02:27.470> is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.270 
there any protein on that sandwich and I
said<00:02:32.300> well<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.720> very<00:02:32.750> much<00:02:33.140> because<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:34.070> you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
said well not very much because as you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.610 
said well not very much because as you
know<00:02:34.310> beans<00:02:34.850> are<00:02:35.150> basically<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.780> car<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.500> they

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
know beans are basically a car but they

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.160 
know beans are basically a car but they
do<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.310> protein<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.900> said

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
do have some protein and then but I said

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.480 
do have some protein and then but I said
but<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.440> wouldn't<00:02:39.709> hurt<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.160> eat<00:02:40.459> a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
but it wouldn't hurt you to eat a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.220 
but it wouldn't hurt you to eat a
vegetarian<00:02:41.030> meal<00:02:41.480> every<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.080> then

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
vegetarian meal every now and then

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.160 
vegetarian meal every now and then
anyway<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.150> he<00:02:44.300> ate<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> sandwich<00:02:44.959> knew

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
anyway and so he ate the sandwich knew

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.860 
anyway and so he ate the sandwich knew
you<00:02:45.260> really<00:02:45.530> liked<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.450> brand<00:02:47.720> of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
you really liked it and so that brand of

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.930 
you really liked it and so that brand of
hummus<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.320> believe<00:02:48.560> was<00:02:48.709> called<00:02:49.190> wild<00:02:49.489> garden

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.750 
hummus I believe was called wild garden
and<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.260> did<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.709> well<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.670> was

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and I really did like it well it was

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.699 
and I really did like it well it was
kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.090> expensive<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.959> thought<00:02:54.230> even<00:02:54.590> though

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
kind of expensive I thought even though

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.040 
kind of expensive I thought even though
they<00:02:54.860> said<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.160> was<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> sale<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:56.570> was<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.989> was

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
they said it was a sale it was it was

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.050 
they said it was a sale it was it was
three<00:02:57.350> dollars<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> pretty<00:02:58.220> small<00:02:58.489> jar<00:02:58.820> and

without refrigerating it I think this is

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.350 
without refrigerating it I think this is
the<00:04:25.389> type<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.630> thing<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:27.430> pretty<00:04:28.270> much

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
the type of thing that you pretty much

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.960 
the type of thing that you pretty much
would<00:04:28.750> need<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.199> have<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.530> cold<00:04:29.800> or<00:04:30.160> it

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
would need to have it cold or it

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.390 
would need to have it cold or it
wouldn't<00:04:31.300> taste<00:04:31.510> good<00:04:31.840> now<00:04:32.470> I'm<00:04:32.680> seeing<00:04:33.130> that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
wouldn't taste good now I'm seeing that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.360 
wouldn't taste good now I'm seeing that
this<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.789> getting<00:04:34.180> kind<00:04:35.139> of<00:04:35.229> like<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.740> pie<00:04:36.310> dough

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
this is getting kind of like a pie dough

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.080 
this is getting kind of like a pie dough
consistency<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.919> it's<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.460> little<00:04:39.880> bit

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
consistency and so it's a little bit

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.870 
consistency and so it's a little bit
thick<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.889> would<00:04:42.130> think<00:04:42.370> maybe<00:04:42.669> you

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
thick and so I would think maybe you

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.730 
thick and so I would think maybe you
might<00:04:43.060> need<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.389> little<00:04:43.630> bit<00:04:43.870> more<00:04:44.080> water<00:04:44.380> like

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
might need a little bit more water like

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.670 
might need a little bit more water like
one<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.039> third<00:04:45.550> cups<00:04:45.910> don't<00:04:46.900> go<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.289> too<00:04:47.440> much

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
one of third cups don't go it too much

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.900 
one of third cups don't go it too much
just<00:04:48.130> do<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.340> few<00:04:48.610> drops<00:04:48.940> at<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.270> time<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.910> so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
just do a few drops at a time and so

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.520 
just do a few drops at a time and so
what<00:04:52.120> are<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.270> going<00:04:52.419> to<00:04:52.539> eat<00:04:52.570> with<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.080> with

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
meal and one would probably be enough

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
really liked these with the hummus when

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.719 
really liked these with the hummus when
I<00:05:52.870> had<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.169> hummus<00:05:53.440> before<00:05:53.860> i<00:05:54.070> bought<00:05:54.699> a

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
I had the hummus before i bought a

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.270 
I had the hummus before i bought a
couple<00:05:54.970> of<00:05:55.210> boxes<00:05:55.360> of<00:05:55.660> these<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.229> so<00:05:56.349> this<00:05:56.530> one

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
couple of boxes of these and so this one

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.690 
couple of boxes of these and so this one
I<00:05:57.340> still<00:05:57.940> have<00:05:58.240> and<00:05:58.860> you'll<00:05:59.860> notice<00:06:00.160> that<00:06:00.370> it

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
I still have and you'll notice that it

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.210 
I still have and you'll notice that it
doesn't<00:06:01.150> say<00:06:01.420> one<00:06:02.200> hundred<00:06:02.530> percent<00:06:02.560> whole

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
doesn't say one hundred percent whole

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.740 
doesn't say one hundred percent whole
grain<00:06:03.520> that's<00:06:03.730> what<00:06:03.940> we<00:06:04.060> always<00:06:04.210> want<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.600> look

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
grain that's what we always want to look

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.800 
grain that's what we always want to look
for<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.980> says<00:06:06.370> eight<00:06:06.610> grams<00:06:07.060> of<00:06:07.330> whole<00:06:07.480> grains

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
for it says eight grams of whole grains

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.379 
for it says eight grams of whole grains
per<00:06:08.139> serving<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:08.889> so<00:06:09.639> when<00:06:09.790> I<00:06:09.910> turn<00:06:10.150> it<00:06:10.300> around

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
per serving and so when I turn it around

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.500 
per serving and so when I turn it around

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
whole grain so I like it when they tell

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.870

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
I know exactly how much whole-grain it

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.350 
I know exactly how much whole-grain it

is because you can buy products that say
whole<00:06:29.110> grain<00:06:29.470> and<00:06:29.890> and<00:06:30.130> they<00:06:30.730> have<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.120> have<00:06:31.270> I

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
whole grain and and they have to have I

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.020 
whole grain and and they have to have I
think<00:06:32.290> maybe<00:06:32.620> they<00:06:32.860> have<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.220> have<00:06:33.400> over<00:06:33.669> half

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
think maybe they have to have over half

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.240 
think maybe they have to have over half
according<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.080> guidelines<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.770> even<00:06:36.040> say

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
according to the guidelines to even say

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.490 
according to the guidelines to even say
that<00:06:36.460> they<00:06:36.610> are<00:06:36.640> whole<00:06:37.000> grain<00:06:37.270> but<00:06:37.870> they<00:06:38.169> can't

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
that they are whole grain but they can't

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.409 
that they are whole grain but they can't
say<00:06:39.010> they're<00:06:39.250> one<00:06:39.430> hundred<00:06:39.460> percent<00:06:39.730> unless

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
say they're one hundred percent unless

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:41.850 
say they're one hundred percent unless
they<00:06:40.630> actually<00:06:40.780> are<00:06:41.230> one<00:06:41.500> hundred<00:06:41.650> percent

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
they actually are one hundred percent

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.970 
they actually are one hundred percent
but<00:06:42.790> these<00:06:43.000> are<00:06:43.210> only<00:06:43.390> 20<00:06:43.900> calories<00:06:44.140> per<00:06:44.770> slice

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
but these are only 20 calories per slice

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.480 
but these are only 20 calories per slice
and<00:06:45.550> these<00:06:46.150> were<00:06:46.510> so<00:06:46.870> good<00:06:47.200> with<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:48.010> hummus

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
and these were so good with the hummus

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.730 
and these were so good with the hummus
dip<00:06:48.520> so<00:06:49.060> that's<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:49.570> that's<00:06:49.930> an<00:06:50.169> idea<00:06:50.440> for<00:06:50.650> you

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
dip so that's and that's an idea for you

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.710 
dip so that's and that's an idea for you
and<00:06:50.919> you<00:06:51.430> can<00:06:51.580> put<00:06:51.820> the<00:06:51.970> hummus<00:06:52.270> dip<00:06:52.300> on<00:06:52.690> the

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
and you can put the hummus dip on the

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.590 
and you can put the hummus dip on the
cracker<00:06:53.080> and<00:06:53.710> then<00:06:54.460> you<00:06:54.640> could<00:06:54.790> top<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:55.120> with

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
cracker and then you could top it with

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.760 
cracker and then you could top it with
some<00:06:56.290> cucumber<00:06:57.160> slices<00:06:57.490> some<00:06:58.210> tomato

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
some cucumber slices some tomato

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.159 
some cucumber slices some tomato
something<00:06:59.770> like<00:06:59.950> that<00:06:59.979> and<00:07:00.520> I<00:07:01.300> also<00:07:01.510> noticed

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
something like that and I also noticed

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.430 
something like that and I also noticed
on<00:07:02.380> the<00:07:02.410> back<00:07:02.710> of<00:07:02.950> the<00:07:03.100> hummus<00:07:03.460> box<00:07:03.790> it<00:07:04.240> has<00:07:05.050> a
