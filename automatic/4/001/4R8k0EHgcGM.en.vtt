00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Nine people today are concerned about the climate 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.899
 and pollution or what you do 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.580
 can do it 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 it is going to be everywhere on the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.049
 pollutant emissions so respected 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.540
 factories cars and so on not so 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 but too much CO2 gets into the air only 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 because you are blowing less pure now 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 is still too much there the solution 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.109
 now the co2 was just out of the air 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.029
 filter out and a possible solution 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.029
 We'll look at it now 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.620
 well check it for first how does solve the 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.649
 nature is actually clear through trees 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.409
 who walk with co2 along with water 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.479
 Use of light in oxygen and sugar 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.740
 So who has an idea many trees too 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.510
 plants 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.370
 stupid only that stop too place 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.110
 and everything falls to humanity 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.390
 what he gets his hands on for himself 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.210
 enough space to have normal trees 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.890
 rather bad how else do you get co2 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.080
 still from the air for example in 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.510
 Factories have the special gas wash 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.060
 So all exhaust gases are here so far 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.970
 filtered that no more co2 expelled 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 This will be worthwhile energy-consuming 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.770
 but natural factories where 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.660
 yes really much co2 in the exhaust can be in it 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.800
 in the normal air is here but that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.110
 problem of co2 content is here only 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.690
 0.04 percent and that with gas bottles too 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.520
 I would be energy consuming because 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.650
 you have to pump a lot of air through it 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.960
 to filter a bit of co2 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.510
 That's why there is a possible solution now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.250
 artificial trees so not now 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.350
 a plastic palm or an artificial one 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.900
 fir-tree or something like that but the devices 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.960
 how trees should reduce the co2 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.630
 the cool thing about those who take passively co2 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.460
 and do not need light that is 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.869
 They can also work at night and you can 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.650
 can many of them on top of each other 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.660
 stack 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.910
 because it does not matter if the bottom part 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.250
 not generally should the up 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.170
 to 1000 times more co2 from the air 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.450
 can absorb as natural trees 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.520
 So really cool 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.560
 the procedure used here like 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.110
 now calls itself rather procedural capture 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.179
 on small plastic pieces some 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 can also be called leaves is a 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.970
 medium applied the co2 binds eg 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.340
 sodium carbonate and water on the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 then they react with co2 and 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.410
 The result is sodium bicarbonate 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.690
 this will be later on a filter of co2 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.090
 again separated so that you get back his 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.090
 The basic material should generally be one 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.030
 artificial tree so a ton of co2 pro 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.280
 blow away day so we would only need 100 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 million trees around the whole year 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.420
 Emission immediately again suck 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 even if that is so cool why 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.340
 we do not make it problem here 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.680
 For one, the costs are such a tree 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.200
 costs $ 20,000 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.780
 and then another $ 200 a ton 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.990
 co2 s.strom so really not straight 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 cheap and another problem where to go 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.420
 the whole collected co2 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.520
 it is just being worked on as it is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.770
 best unstable fixed connections 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.150
 how limestone can bind or it 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.790
 turns it into a fuel again 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.450
 Nevertheless, a cool idea is the climate change 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.860
 to stop 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.600
 if you are even more for 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.280
 environmental issues are looking at you 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780
 here our video to the ozone hole 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.430
 otherwise send the others 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.200
 channels to simple works and last one 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.730
 abo da if you like the videos 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.730
 does well and see you soon so
