00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello to all the geeks and yuki I hope 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 that you have the potato the gap being 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 given that I show you my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.039
 technique is really extraordinary 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.850
 to do this a lot a lot of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.250
 credit entry can we then these 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.539
 techniques she really works great 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.750
 well the only thing that is a little bit 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 balls and mills 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.750
 I'll tell you why it's a bit 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.250
 breakage then in fact it was who 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.100
 is to buy players at night 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 and resell them in broad daylight 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 if I take the example of rodrigues I 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 the 650 bought for example and I the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 sell the 2000 or even more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.960
 in the middle of the day so I 'm going to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 to show his dagger was waiting 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 it's really a player who walks very 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.370
 very much sure that I really thought 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.430
 years old if we look a little bit 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.650
 shows that's 7004 1500 and 1600 3000 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 you know what it is that wholesale prices 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.689
 while I really cheap him in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.460
 full night 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.200
 and it really works extremely air 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 in fact you will propose to propose 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.880
 bidding on players so I'm going 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 do you do I tell you the players who 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.470
 are who sells the best anyway 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.570
 in the middle of the day when we can 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.070
 make big margins are so 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.930
 rodrigues view there it's really the one 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.799
 which I advise you the most then he 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.479
 ya benzema 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.909
 there are also van persie and falcao and who 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.490
 also gaga there is rooney and then there is 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.909
 also caused how extremely well to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.619
 when that big fat margin 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.730
 with the uaw way I'll put you to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.860
 the screen the list of players 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.660
 so you guys are going to propose some 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.490
 auction on his players then following 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.540
 the price who are you going to have them 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.010
 about 1000 or even 2000 credits less 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.480
 only on the price of the day of which you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.970
 are you going to make a profit of 1000 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.830
 even 2013 or per player obligatorily 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.390
 and especially with players who are 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.110
 really cheap so there for example 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.180
 I 'm doing myself I'm getting 1500 on 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.840

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.100
 to sleep but if you do at least one 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.500
 night you buy a quarantine of yourself 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.150
