00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.529
 remakes of pokemon ruby omega and sapphire 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.650
 good alpha guys have feared the filter 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 obviously the scans of the corocoro yesterday 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 I said that many may have leaked 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.809
 more during yesterday I said I expected the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.490
 filter many more etcetera etcetera and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.990
 yesterday they finished filtering the glasses 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.250
 who had been waiting for them to get a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.840
 little bit more information and so on 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.910
 I also uploaded three videos I did not want either 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.230

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.059
 Well I prefer to bring it today than by 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980

 style surely bring it we will see 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.510
 to see part of what lasts me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 battery but good because there are going to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 talk about the scans of the corocoro be 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 there are a few about six is ​​cannes 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.059
 which is seen throughout the high command that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 we will talk about the high command in a way 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 quite interesting and some things that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.010
 those of emery have already said 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.309
 you know that I get into forums and so on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.109
 etcetera and also the noaa pokédex me 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.789
 It seems very peculiar and very interesting 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.440
 it pretty cool and it reminds me good is a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.329
 good wink to the game boy advance to the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.150
 we will see on the screen very probably and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.720
 aside the theme of the madame pica chus and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.490
 also the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 the image of the birch teacher that that is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.150
 very, very interesting 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 just as a little fat is unlikely 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 normal over there for you let's see 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 first of all the game boy advance the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 you see it on the screen you know 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 that remakes good remakes the games 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
 original so to speak pokemon ruby 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.370
 Sapphire came out just before 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 come out the game boy advance sp is that the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 change so sps in the first game boy 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.190
 that has to overlap that has the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 top so to speak with the screen 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.880
 small etcetera etcetera and the gameboy 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
 advance that still had no color in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 the screen etcetera etcetera then it is the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.510
 last game boy that has no cap 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.160
 it has swamps and it does not have the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.900
 screen or the monkey that do have 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
 screen has no screen with light or 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.810
 has a lid so good wink the truth 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 thank you and cool it down to do that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 piece of poker lengths that cool 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.720
 very much should make it tamagotchi me 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 cago in the queue is one gameboy 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.650
 stool a pocket is like that with tamagotchi 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.910
 come on I bought it let's go shut up and 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.729
 Take my money see what I do in the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.890
 upstairs you see a pikachu a madame 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.660
 pikachu something strange that still does not 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.979
 knows many speaks that can be the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.200
 theme of contests and so on etc. 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.820
 but you still do not know anything the next is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 can be seen by one who is the second the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.190
 gym leader 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.930
 at level 18 that are not at level 18 they are 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.790
 at level 19 because pokemon is true 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.140
 until 2019 and in ruby ​​pokemon I was 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.760
 level 18 in I know because I'm 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.010
 happening now the ruby ​​starter what 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360
 I knew is the level change in amber 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.790
 see he knew he is at level 19 because 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.829
 the emerald is a bit more difficult 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.390
 that blonde pokemon so I hope that what 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.860
 make this game more difficult than pokemon 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.150
 ruby that is not that hard either 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.769
 but well let's hope they do it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.750
 little bit more anyway, here they have 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.849
 filtering some taking on screen 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.110
 You see a drop of water on a page 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.790
 america one-name one page 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.530
 Japanese a Chinese page that I do not know 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.239
 but hey it looks pretty good at the level 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.069
 the peaks seem to be that these are 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.450
 the costumes that you can wear in the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.160
 contests seems to have been remodeled 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.769
 completely the theme of the contests 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.120
 pokemon and it's one thing that I love is 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.410
 also contests fall in love 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.909
 honestly that's one thing that I 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.099
 I do not know why but I love it 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.079
 the theme of doing because cube is to get us 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.780
 in charisma in beauty et cetera etcetera 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.730
 with those with the tapes and such is now 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.870
 it's cool that they put costumes to see if 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.340
 they have more beauty charisma and so on 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.349
 etcetera hours that pretty cool what 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.260
 I do not know is if you can disguise everyone 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.090
 all kinds of pokemon only to the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.000
 picachos is something that is not yet known 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.500
 and that 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.390
 I will update when a little bit is known 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.330
 more information also by the way 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.950
 filter or confirm that there will be little 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.360
 I recess why I had a break 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.860
 there are remakes continue to exist 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.910
 they say he's going to see a couple of changes 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.090
 he knew that there will be new mini-games 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.730
 et cetera etcetera and it is also filtered 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.920
 good is filtered or is said to be 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.080
 the super workout does not come out does not come out 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.760
 today but I think it will be seen in 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.750
 at least the super enters mentor 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.340
 if there is not your approach as a 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.720
 pokémon xe and this is already a thing that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.730
 you know, I think you're going to see something with 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 the poke cubes I do not know why with the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.280
 such fences go up the sets of such 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.810
 pokemon something like maybe we'll see to see 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.890
 I do not know anything yet I do not want to confirm 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.410
 nothing obviously this is nothing 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.060
 My guess but anyway we'll see 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.030
 by the way here you also see the teacher 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.709
 birch airways pretty normal fat couple 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.230
 we came in remembered them less fat not 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.150
 I know why I believe that the years do not fall 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.920
 in vain for nobody and this teacher is a 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.480
 slightly fatter than normal 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.190
 here we also have the high command 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.199
 so much for one obviously not 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.579
 but if we see the leaders good 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.660
 the media with much better quality than 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.880
 before yesterday 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.770
 there you see them and to the right of girl 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.539
 high command I hope that the high command what 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.220
 make it a little harder than that of 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.510
 I wanted to and I think that it will be good 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.460
 basically the same as ruby ​​sapphire 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.919
 or the emerald but I hope there 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.210
 still a re league is to say that when it happens 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.470
 is the league you can come back to go with 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.449
 its because you go to level 80 and so on 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.770
 etcetera I hope because and to see how it does 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.050
 the pokemon league is true because the league 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.460
 pokemon of de pokemon rubí sapphire era 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 pretty spectacular but I want to see in 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 3 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.980
 what I want and I hope it's better 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.500
 that in pokémon xy suppose also to 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.290
 maximum champion with that mega goal gro 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.150
 we write before three or four days 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.260
 but well there are mega meta gross and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.729
 little bit more these are the scans 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.830
 saved enough information 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.540
 sincerely the theme of the super bases 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.490
 secret mega goal gross and now with 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.139
 this so a lot of information is 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.180
 week we will see if something else comes out 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.389
 during these days we hope that yes by 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.930
 true the high command that I see I do not see 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.820
 that nobody has a mega stone in plan 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.530
 to see the team leader to wyler's 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.260
 Magma team have mega stones already 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.370
 has 11 do not have the glasses other has not 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.139
 I know where but good you see that they have 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.450
 mega stones but both a high command 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.460
 as the top champion I do not see where it is 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.870
 its good mega stone without maximums and 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.270
 maximum forgiveness has the bracelet is the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.550
 snap that bracelet and the others 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.850
 it seems that maybe not sixto have 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.280
 little of a bracelet maybe every I do not know 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.650
 maybe that core is mega two clubs and 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.540
 csif sad to mega shifter 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.770
 I do not know, it's not that I would like everyone 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.940
 they are taking them have an evolution 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.639
 but when is it rather doubt 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.500
 I wish we had seen the first round 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.000
 of the pokemon league do not have mega 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.440
 developments in the second round when and 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.900
 be in the low level 80 as I say I'm 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.940
 assuming a lot but maybe yes that 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.050
 have mega evolution or not to know if 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.130
 this information can leave a layman a 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.380
