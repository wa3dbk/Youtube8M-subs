because<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> fact<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.190> does<00:02:59.400> have

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
because of the fact that it does have

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.420 
because of the fact that it does have
like<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.170> second<00:03:01.769> or<00:03:01.890> two<00:03:02.040> second

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
like the you know second or two second

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.880 
like the you know second or two second
delay<00:03:02.459> it'd<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.480> kind<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.690> hard<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.019> go<00:03:04.739> over

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
delay it'd be kind of hard to go over

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.140 
delay it'd be kind of hard to go over
the<00:03:04.980> stuff<00:03:05.190> maybe<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.489> could<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.120> know

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the stuff maybe I could just you know

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.839 
the stuff maybe I could just you know
you<00:03:06.780> show<00:03:06.959> screenshots<00:03:07.590> or<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.790> don't

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
you show screenshots or do it I don't

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.870 
you show screenshots or do it I don't
know<00:03:09.090> well<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:09.540> gonna<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.319> can<00:03:10.760> get<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
know well I'm gonna see if I can get it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.610 
know well I'm gonna see if I can get it
to<00:03:12.030> work<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.390> little<00:03:12.480> faster<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:13.080> don't<00:03:13.260> know<00:03:13.410> if

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
to work a little faster I don't know if

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.070 
to work a little faster I don't know if
maybe<00:03:14.580> there's<00:03:14.819> like<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> desktop<00:03:15.540> client<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
maybe there's like a desktop client I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.300 
maybe there's like a desktop client I
think<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> would<00:03:16.500> be<00:03:16.620> awesome<00:03:16.739> if<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.130> didn't

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
think that would be awesome if I didn't

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.340 
think that would be awesome if I didn't
have<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.519> use<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> browser<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.390> think<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:19.260> it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
have to use the browser I think then it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.050 
have to use the browser I think then it
would<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.769> instantaneous<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:21.000> uh

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
would be more instantaneous but uh

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.420 
would be more instantaneous but uh
anyway<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:22.019> AirDroid<00:03:22.530> room<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.250> find
