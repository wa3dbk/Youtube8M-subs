00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.969
 through bread with coma 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.780
 against 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.290
 ap moves with eight arms to his three hearts compean blue blood that 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.290
 change color in an instant 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.150
 your flexible body can go through the smallest clefts your brain 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
 solve difficult situations 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.359
 these attributes it is difficult to imagine a more intriguing creature and that the octopus 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.359
 paul 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.300
 the octopuses 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 squid the subsidiary but kilos 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.290
 they form the class of invertebrates known as cephalopods 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.900
 they are not relatives of mollusks like oysters and clams 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.489
 avn 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.679
 but unlike these mollusks, octopuses have no control of the protects 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.130
 their soft body offers them no protection against predators so 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.620
 that hides in most of the time 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.050
 most of them live in caches or small caves at the bottom of the ocean 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 there they stay unless they go out to look for food 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.009
 when exposed the octopus relies on several defenses 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 one of the best in his ability to camouflage himself 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.380
 the cells that cover your body controls the pigments in your skin and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 help to get confused in the surroundings 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 If that does not work, the octopus creates a 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.550
 interest weighs on your attacker 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.500
 It is low 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.600
 the season the attacker with him 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 a quotient to be rid of 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 It does not taste good so the hungry bregador does not think again 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 Being soft and flexible has its advantages 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.490
 believe it or not this group can get into this bottle 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 now it is well protected 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.759
 unlike other invertebrates the octopus can see the images with its 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.759
 acute vision 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.839
 but its most developed sense is touch 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.839
 its tentacles are covered by dozens of suckers 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.779
 there are three types of cells in the skin of each suction cup some feel the tension 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.879
 others the pressure but most detect the chemicals and act as 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
 easy 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.799
 when moving the next point 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 one of the citizens 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.359
 but in an instant it is moving a stream of water is passing 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.259
 back in his hiding place the octopus covers the entrance with rocks 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.340
 these creatures have a very large and developed brain and they have behaviors 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 very complex 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 solve problems by feeling the current situation 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.119
 this octopus calculation how to remove the plug to this car 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 the prize was a great fret without luck trapped inside 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.989
 here in the laboratory another octopus looks for a way out of the tank 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.469
 They are very skilled to escape a thousand thanks to their strength an octopus of medium 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 kilo can lift a layer of 18 kilos 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.479
 scientists analyze whether behaviors like these can be 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.049
 signs of intelligence 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.069
 it is certainly fascinating to observe these strange creatures
