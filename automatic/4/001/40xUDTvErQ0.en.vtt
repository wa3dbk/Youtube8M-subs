some<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.340> your<00:00:17.460> questions<00:00:17.609> today<00:00:18.300> if<00:00:18.990> that's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
some of your questions today if that's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.259 
some of your questions today if that's
all<00:00:19.949> right<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.020> question

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
all right with you the first question

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.230 
all right with you the first question
what's<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.420> opinion<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.960> calisthenics<00:00:26.240> now

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
what's your opinion on calisthenics now

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.259 
what's your opinion on calisthenics now
by<00:00:27.390> calisthenics<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.439> he<00:00:28.529> means

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
by calisthenics I think he means

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.240 
by calisthenics I think he means
bodyweight<00:00:30.269> exercises<00:00:30.960> sit-ups<00:00:31.890> push-ups

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
bodyweight exercises sit-ups push-ups

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
bodyweight exercises sit-ups push-ups
pull-ups<00:00:32.870> burpees<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> thing

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
pull-ups burpees that kind of thing

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.150 
pull-ups burpees that kind of thing
I<00:00:35.510> think<00:00:36.510> calisthenics<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.230> good<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.680> as

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I think calisthenics are good to do as

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630 
I think calisthenics are good to do as
part<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> conditioning<00:00:39.149> routine<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> let's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
part of a conditioning routine so let's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270 
part of a conditioning routine so let's
say<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.620> fifteen<00:00:43.620> seconds<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> burpees

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
say you do fifteen seconds of burpees

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
say you do fifteen seconds of burpees
and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.940> rest<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:46.579> do<00:00:47.660> push-ups<00:00:48.660> rest

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and then rest or do push-ups rest

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160 
and then rest or do push-ups rest
pull-ups<00:00:49.920> rest<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> good<00:00:52.110> way

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
pull-ups rest I think that's a good way

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
pull-ups rest I think that's a good way
to<00:00:52.350> condition<00:00:52.949> yourself<00:00:53.039> also<00:00:54.230> calisthenics

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to condition yourself also calisthenics

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.720 
to condition yourself also calisthenics
are<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> built<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.660> fat<00:00:57.660> test<00:00:58.079> if

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
are kind of a built in fat test if

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.549 
are kind of a built in fat test if
calisthenics<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.910> difficult

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
calisthenics get difficult

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.290 
calisthenics get difficult
but<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.980> other<00:01:02.160> lifts<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
but all your other lifts are going up it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
but all your other lifts are going up it
might<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.830> getting

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
might just be because you're getting

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.149 
might just be because you're getting
fatter<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> check<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.439> like

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
fatter so they kind of check you like

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
fatter so they kind of check you like
the<00:01:08.610> pull-ups<00:01:08.970> start<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.630> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the pull-ups start to get hard but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
the pull-ups start to get hard but
you're<00:01:10.560> rowing<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.070> getting<00:01:11.340> better<00:01:11.659> well

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you're rowing is getting better well

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
you're rowing is getting better well
you're<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:12.900> pulling<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.619> lard<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you're just pulling it more lard so I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.170 
you're just pulling it more lard so I
think<00:01:15.540> calisthenics<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> good<00:01:16.799> for

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
think calisthenics would be good for

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.590 
think calisthenics would be good for
conditioning<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.560> strength<00:01:19.560> training

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
conditioning for strength training

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
conditioning for strength training
they're<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> point<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.759> all

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
they're good to a point but as we all

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
they're good to a point but as we all
know<00:01:24.090> progressive<00:01:24.689> overloads<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> name<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
know progressive overloads the name of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.700 
know progressive overloads the name of
the<00:01:25.650> game<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.590> much

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the game so you can only put so much

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
the game so you can only put so much
 in<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.189> weight<00:01:29.369> vest<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> result

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
 in a weight vest and as a result

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
 in a weight vest and as a result
you<00:01:32.009> won't<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.280> able<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> overload

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you won't be able to overload

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520 
you won't be able to overload
progressively<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
progressively like you would with a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
progressively like you would with a
barbell<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> mix<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> calisthenics

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
barbell so you can mix in calisthenics

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
barbell so you can mix in calisthenics
once<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> while<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.619> strength

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
once in a while in your strength

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.480 
once in a while in your strength
training<00:01:41.130> program<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:42.829> don't<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.130> would

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
training program I don't know if I would

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
training program I don't know if I would
base<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.299> entire<00:01:45.390> program<00:01:45.960> around

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
base an entire program around

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.670 
base an entire program around
calisthenics<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.610> fact<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.119> wouldn't<00:01:48.680> but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
calisthenics in fact I wouldn't but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.710 
calisthenics in fact I wouldn't but
they're<00:01:50.280> definitely<00:01:50.549> good<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.000> conditioning

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
they're definitely good for conditioning

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.960 
they're definitely good for conditioning
so<00:01:52.579> that's<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:53.939> about

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
so that's what I think about

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.450 
so that's what I think about
calisthenics<00:01:55.340> second<00:01:56.340> question

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460
