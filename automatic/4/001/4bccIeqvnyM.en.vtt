cradles the edge of the fingerboard so

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.860 
cradles the edge of the fingerboard so
when<00:00:48.339> we<00:00:48.429> turn<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:48.820> round<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.390> put<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.780> in

place on the guitar the thing that you
might<00:00:52.809> notice<00:00:53.109> is<00:00:53.199> first<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.949> all<00:00:54.070> when<00:00:54.249> you

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
might notice is first of all when you

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.180 
might notice is first of all when you
put<00:00:54.339> it<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:56.109> slips<00:00:56.469> down<00:00:56.620> into<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.039> slot

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
put it on is it slips down into the slot

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.430 
put it on is it slips down into the slot
we've<00:00:58.059> not<00:00:58.269> had<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.510> file<00:00:58.719> any<00:00:58.989> off<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.289> back

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
we've not had to file any off the back

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.649 
we've not had to file any off the back
edge<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.249> you<00:01:00.370> might<00:01:00.519> have<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.940> you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
edge of this like you might have to you

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:02.819 
edge of this like you might have to you
might<00:01:01.870> have<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.050> file<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.260> little<00:01:02.530> bit<00:01:02.649> from

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
might have to file a little bit from

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.950 
might have to file a little bit from
this<00:01:02.949> back<00:01:03.129> edge<00:01:03.370> if<00:01:03.670> there's<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.030> too<00:01:04.720> tight

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
this back edge if there's a too tight

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.320 
this back edge if there's a too tight
slot<00:01:05.290> for<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.530> going<00:01:05.890> but<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.000> will<00:01:07.120> drop

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
slot for it going but this one will drop

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.690 
slot for it going but this one will drop
down<00:01:07.540> in<00:01:07.780> there<00:01:07.990> now<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:09.100> thing<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.340> when<00:01:09.640> we

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
down in there now the thing is when we

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.210 
down in there now the thing is when we
place<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.680> look<00:01:11.830> very<00:01:11.950> carefully

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.270 
place this on if you look very carefully
you<00:01:12.520> can<00:01:13.000> see<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.450> there's<00:01:13.630> actually<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.990> gap

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.969 
actually get that to fit with no gap
there<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.020> give<00:01:47.170> me<00:01:47.259> an<00:01:47.380> idea<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.799> where

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
there just to give me an idea of where

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.340 
there just to give me an idea of where
to<00:01:48.009> start<00:01:48.159> I've<00:01:48.909> actually<00:01:49.060> gone<00:01:49.359> reach<00:01:49.689> for<00:01:50.049> a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
to start I've actually gone reach for a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.870 
to start I've actually gone reach for a
set<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.680> feeler<00:01:50.859> gauges<00:01:51.130> which<00:01:51.460> we<00:01:51.609> have<00:01:51.789> in

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
set of feeler gauges which we have in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880 
set of feeler gauges which we have in
the<00:01:51.969> workshop<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:53.259> off<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.619> sort<00:01:53.859> of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the workshop here it's off the sort of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.490 
the workshop here it's off the sort of
thing<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.250> might<00:01:54.280> use<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:56.020> know<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.439> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
thing that you might use you know on a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.289 
thing that you might use you know on a
car<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.520> you're<00:01:57.640> doing<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.850> sparkplug

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
car and you're doing the sparkplug

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.749 
car and you're doing the sparkplug
adjustment<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:58.960> I've<00:01:59.890> just<00:02:00.070> taken<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.520> couple

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
adjustment and I've just taken a couple

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.760 
adjustment and I've just taken a couple
and<00:02:01.270> we're<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:01.780> sort<00:02:02.109> of<00:02:02.140> giving<00:02:02.350> ourselves

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
and we're just sort of giving ourselves

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.389 
and we're just sort of giving ourselves
an<00:02:02.859> idea<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.399> what<00:02:03.609> gap<00:02:03.880> we've<00:02:04.479> got<00:02:04.719> underneath

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
an idea of what gap we've got underneath

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.400 
an idea of what gap we've got underneath
there<00:02:06.399> some<00:02:06.670> taking<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.299> couple<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.630> leaves<00:02:07.869> of

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
there some taking a couple of leaves of

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.730 
there some taking a couple of leaves of
the<00:02:08.530> feeler<00:02:08.740> gauge<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:11.080> them<00:02:11.260> under<00:02:11.650> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
the feeler gauge and put them under the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.530 
the feeler gauge and put them under the
gap<00:02:11.920> there<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.940> need<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.450> at

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
gap there so I know that I need to at

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.260 
gap there so I know that I need to at
least<00:02:13.570> take<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:15.370> nut<00:02:15.640> job

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
least take this nut job

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.150 
least take this nut job
so<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:17.200> I'm<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> actually<00:02:17.650> do<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.070> I'm

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
so what I'm going to actually do is I'm

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.850 
so what I'm going to actually do is I'm
going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.400> seat<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.910> nut<00:02:19.300> down<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.380> surface

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
going to seat this nut down on a surface

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.460 
going to seat this nut down on a surface
and<00:02:21.210> scribe<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.330> line<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.840> top<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.260> those<00:02:23.409> two

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and scribe a line on top of those two

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.680 
and scribe a line on top of those two
feeler<00:02:23.950> gauges<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.209> show<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.540> amount

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
feeler gauges just to show the amount

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.199 
feeler gauges just to show the amount
that<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> have<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.349> actually<00:02:26.610> remove<00:02:27.610> from<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
that I have to actually remove from the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.010 
that I have to actually remove from the
underside

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
underside

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.870 
underside
of<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.100> I'm<00:02:30.190> going<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> crack<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.850> with

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
of this so I'm going to crack on with

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.650 
of this so I'm going to crack on with
that<00:02:33.030> right<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.210> we're<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.540> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
that right so we're going to have to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.660 
that right so we're going to have to
have<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> look<00:02:35.020> how<00:02:35.680> much<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.070> move<00:02:36.280> from<00:02:36.490> both

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
have a look how much to move from both

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.280 
have a look how much to move from both
for<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:36.940> now<00:02:37.570> what<00:02:37.720> I'm<00:02:37.780> actually<00:02:37.930> going<00:02:38.170> to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
for this now what I'm actually going to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.040 
for this now what I'm actually going to
do<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.190> lay<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> hard

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
do is I'm going to lay this on a hard

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.200 
do is I'm going to lay this on a hard
surface<00:02:41.290> put<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> nut<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.700> front<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.060> it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
surface put the nut in front of it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.050 
surface put the nut in front of it
subscriber<00:02:44.170> line<00:02:44.530> there<00:02:45.340> obviously<00:02:45.850> I'll

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
subscriber line there obviously I'll

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.610 
subscriber line there obviously I'll
turn<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.330> around<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.870> see<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.500> it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
turn it around so I can see it to do it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.330 
turn it around so I can see it to do it
here<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.410> also<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.740> in<00:02:50.950> front<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.250> us

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
here so what we also have in front of us

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.060 
here so what we also have in front of us
here<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.730> I've<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:51.910> some<00:02:52.120> sandpaper<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.890> it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
here is I've got some sandpaper and it's

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.460 
here is I've got some sandpaper and it's
actually<00:02:54.400> down<00:02:54.580> on<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.910> sheet<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.210> glass<00:02:55.470> so

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
actually down on a sheet of glass so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.350 
actually down on a sheet of glass so
that<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.830> very<00:02:57.340> flat<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.030> we're<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.330> to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
that it's very flat and we're going to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.170 
that it's very flat and we're going to
actually<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:59.040> running<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.130> back<00:03:00.400> towards<00:03:01.000> on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
actually be running this back towards on

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180 
actually be running this back towards on
the<00:03:01.330> sandpaper<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:02.470> remove<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.830> not<00:03:02.980> be<00:03:03.100> earth

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the sandpaper to remove a not be earth

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.540 
the sandpaper to remove a not be earth
material<00:03:03.640> underneath<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.250> I've<00:03:06.400> actually

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
material underneath so I've actually

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120 
material underneath so I've actually
scribes<00:03:07.060> line<00:03:07.360> with<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> sharp<00:03:08.200> blade<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.950> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
now one of the things that even we have

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.970 
now one of the things that even we have
to<00:03:52.270> be<00:03:52.360> very<00:03:52.570> careful<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.990> when<00:03:53.140> we<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.410> do<00:03:53.830> this

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
to be very careful of when we do do this

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.520 
to be very careful of when we do do this
all<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.160> time<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:55.000> being<00:03:55.210> careful<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.260> you

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
all the time it's being careful that you
