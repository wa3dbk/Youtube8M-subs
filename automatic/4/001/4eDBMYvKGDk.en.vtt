00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
to rely on high jump kick kidding is a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
to rely on high jump kick kidding is a
Raikou<00:01:52.920> instead<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.390> taking<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.630> with

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Raikou instead of taking it out with

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
Raikou instead of taking it out with
earthquake<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> since<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:55.649> has<00:01:55.680> HP<00:01:56.189> ice

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
earthquake and since he has HP ice

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
earthquake and since he has HP ice
instead<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.360> tree<00:01:57.570> grass<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.320> going

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
instead of a tree grass that's not going

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.100 
instead of a tree grass that's not going
to<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110
