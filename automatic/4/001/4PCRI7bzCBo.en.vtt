00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
to D the new ii ii bar so that's kind of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.389

the base the second part the main part

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.900 
the base the second part the main part
of<00:01:16.460> lead<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:17.050> just<00:01:18.050> doing<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.350> little<00:01:21.789> and<00:01:22.789> then

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
of lead is just doing a little and then

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.669 
of lead is just doing a little and then
the<00:01:23.000> second<00:01:23.360> part<00:01:23.509> is<00:01:23.630> on<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.840> d<00:01:23.990> string<00:01:24.020> same

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
then it drops down to doing it has the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
exact same base notes it just changes up

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.720 
exact same base notes it just changes up
the<00:01:52.130> high<00:01:52.340> end<00:01:52.580> part<00:01:52.850> from<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:55.640> it

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
the high end part from this and then it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.410 
the high end part from this and then it
goes<00:01:55.910> up<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.240> right<00:01:56.510> here

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
and letting the delay kind of fill in

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.110 
and letting the delay kind of fill in
the<00:04:02.750> gaps<00:04:02.810> but<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.220> best<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.730> pick<00:04:05.000> it

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the gaps but the best that I can pick it

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:22.390

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
that my middle fingers on the 11th fret

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.460 
that my middle fingers on the 11th fret
point<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> finger<00:04:46.610> on<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.240> 10th<00:04:47.630> fret<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.560> then

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.199 
point a finger on the 10th fret and then
and<00:04:51.470> then<00:04:51.620> just<00:04:51.770> from<00:04:51.919> 9<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.970> 11

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:57.209 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.579 

then<00:04:58.209> it<00:04:58.330> drops<00:04:58.539> down<00:04:58.749> to<00:04:58.809> the<00:04:59.080> B<00:04:59.319> and<00:04:59.469> the<00:04:59.559> E

00:04:59.579 --> 00:04:59.589 
then it drops down to the B and the E

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:05.820 
then it drops down to the B and the E
string<00:05:00.069> just<00:05:01.979> some<00:05:03.029> ninth<00:05:04.559> fret<00:05:05.559> on<00:05:05.619> the<00:05:05.739> E

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
string just some ninth fret on the E

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.079 
string just some ninth fret on the E
string<00:05:06.249> and<00:05:06.339> the<00:05:06.429> tenth<00:05:06.639> fret<00:05:06.789> on<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.999> B

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.089 
string and the tenth fret on the B

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:13.439 
string and the tenth fret on the B
string<00:05:07.209> my<00:05:07.809> middle<00:05:08.050> finger<00:05:08.319> so

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.119 

pretty<00:05:14.050> basic<00:05:14.199> so<00:05:14.680> all<00:05:14.770> together<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:15.099> sounds

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
pretty basic so all together it sounds

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:29.719 
pretty basic so all together it sounds
like<00:05:15.309> this

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.589 

so<00:05:30.729> that's<00:05:30.909> pretty<00:05:31.029> much<00:05:31.150> that

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
so that's pretty much that

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.299 
so that's pretty much that
so<00:05:32.349> on<00:05:32.439> the<00:05:32.529> next<00:05:32.650> part<00:05:32.919> right<00:05:33.069> after<00:05:33.219> the

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:33.309 
so on the next part right after the

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:35.749 
so on the next part right after the
course<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.669> drops<00:05:33.849> into<00:05:34.029> a<00:05:34.089> guitar<00:05:34.240> part<00:05:34.659> this

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
course it drops into a guitar part this

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.730 
course it drops into a guitar part this
has<00:05:36.759> a<00:05:37.419> couple<00:05:37.870> different<00:05:38.110> variations<00:05:38.229> of<00:05:38.680> it

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
has a couple different variations of it

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.869 
has a couple different variations of it
but<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:38.979> first<00:05:39.189> time<00:05:39.370> they<00:05:39.460> do<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.610> after<00:05:39.819> the

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
but the first time they do it after the

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.850 
but the first time they do it after the
course<00:05:40.150> it's<00:05:40.389> just<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.599> basic<00:05:40.960> slide<00:05:41.229> octave

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
course it's just a basic slide octave

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.079 
course it's just a basic slide octave
thing<00:05:42.069> that<00:05:42.279> they<00:05:42.370> do<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.639> a<00:05:42.699> lot<00:05:42.849> of<00:05:42.879> their

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
thing that they do in a lot of their

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.589 
thing that they do in a lot of their
leads<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.409> so<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:44.860> got<00:05:45.099> my<00:05:45.300> pointer<00:05:46.300> finger<00:05:46.569> on

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
leads and so I got my pointer finger on

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.929 
leads and so I got my pointer finger on
the<00:05:46.870> D<00:05:47.020> string<00:05:47.050> on<00:05:47.559> the<00:05:47.620> fifth<00:05:47.800> fret<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.639> I

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:48.939 
the D string on the fifth fret and I

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.249 
the D string on the fifth fret and I
tend<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.270> use<00:05:49.360> my<00:05:49.509> pinky<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:49.960> could<00:05:50.080> use<00:05:50.169> your

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
tend to use my pinky you could use your

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.769 
tend to use my pinky you could use your
ring<00:05:50.409> finger<00:05:50.800> on<00:05:51.189> the<00:05:51.699> g<00:05:52.029> string<00:05:52.059> on<00:05:52.599> the

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
ring finger on the g string on the

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.570 
ring finger on the g string on the
seventh<00:05:53.110> fret<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:53.770> all<00:05:54.099> you're<00:05:54.279> doing<00:05:54.460> is

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
seventh fret and all you're doing is

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.429 
seventh fret and all you're doing is
you're<00:05:54.699> sliding<00:05:54.999> if<00:05:55.749> you're<00:05:55.990> you're<00:05:56.110> marking

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
you're sliding if you're you're marking

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.719 
you're sliding if you're you're marking
your<00:05:56.499> pointer<00:05:56.830> finger<00:05:57.099> that's<00:05:57.309> going<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.550> just

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
your pointer finger that's going to just

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.519 
your pointer finger that's going to just
pick<00:05:57.849> one<00:05:58.029> finger<00:05:58.389> and<00:05:58.569> use<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.199> mark<00:05:59.379> out

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
pick one finger and use that to mark out

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.829 
pick one finger and use that to mark out
where<00:05:59.559> you're<00:05:59.770> going<00:05:59.949> I'll<00:06:00.879> just<00:06:01.059> keep<00:06:01.659> this

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
where you're going I'll just keep this

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.329 
where you're going I'll just keep this
shape<00:06:02.050> going<00:06:02.379> and<00:06:02.499> I'll<00:06:02.589> look<00:06:02.830> at<00:06:02.919> my<00:06:02.979> pointer

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:03.339 
shape going and I'll look at my pointer

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.639 
shape going and I'll look at my pointer
finger<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.639> go<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.360> next<00:06:04.539> spot<00:06:04.659> and<00:06:05.499> so<00:06:05.589> I'm

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:05.649 
finger to go to the next spot and so I'm

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:06.929 
finger to go to the next spot and so I'm
going<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.860> move<00:06:05.979> from<00:06:06.069> the<00:06:06.219> fifth<00:06:06.430> fret<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:06.849> the

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
going to move from the fifth fret to the

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.700 
going to move from the fifth fret to the
seventh<00:06:07.240> fret<00:06:07.449> and<00:06:07.960> just<00:06:08.139> keep<00:06:08.289> this<00:06:08.469> shape

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
seventh fret and just keep this shape

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.320 
seventh fret and just keep this shape
consistent<00:06:09.339> throughout<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.029> little<00:06:10.240> guitar

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
consistent throughout the little guitar

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.749 
consistent throughout the little guitar
part<00:06:10.719> so<00:06:11.229> all<00:06:11.409> you're<00:06:11.559> doing<00:06:11.589> is<00:06:11.979> your<00:06:12.189> strum

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
part so all you're doing is your strum

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.189 
part so all you're doing is your strum
and<00:06:12.879> kind<00:06:13.059> of<00:06:13.120> harder<00:06:13.449> because<00:06:13.659> the<00:06:13.779> dynamic

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
and kind of harder because the dynamic

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.929 
and kind of harder because the dynamic
jumps<00:06:14.469> up<00:06:14.649> and<00:06:15.129> you're<00:06:15.249> sliding<00:06:15.639> up<00:06:15.729> to<00:06:15.849> the

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
jumps up and you're sliding up to the

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:23.579 
jumps up and you're sliding up to the
seventh<00:06:16.180> fret

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:23.589 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.779 

something<00:06:24.589> like<00:06:24.740> that<00:06:24.919> it<00:06:25.159> does<00:06:25.279> a<00:06:25.309> bunch<00:06:25.669> of

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
something like that it does a bunch of

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.189 
something like that it does a bunch of
different<00:06:26.029> variations<00:06:26.270> of<00:06:26.569> that<00:06:26.629> so<00:06:26.990> after

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
different variations of that so after

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.769 
different variations of that so after
the<00:06:27.319> second<00:06:27.649> course<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:27.979> drops<00:06:28.219> into<00:06:28.779> this

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
the second course it drops into this

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.089 
the second course it drops into this
guitar<00:06:30.110> part<00:06:30.349> and<00:06:30.499> the<00:06:30.559> guitar<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:30.979> the

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
guitar part and the guitar and the

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.230 
guitar part and the guitar and the
vocals<00:06:31.459> are<00:06:31.550> doing<00:06:31.729> something<00:06:31.939> pretty

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
vocals are doing something pretty

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.209 
vocals are doing something pretty
similar<00:06:32.509> and<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.259> guitar<00:06:33.529> part<00:06:33.800> is<00:06:33.979> pretty

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
similar and the guitar part is pretty

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.649 
similar and the guitar part is pretty
much<00:06:34.339> just<00:06:34.490> doing<00:06:34.729> this<00:06:34.879> it's<00:06:35.119> just<00:06:35.179> octaves

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
much just doing this it's just octaves

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.269 
much just doing this it's just octaves
you<00:06:35.749> got<00:06:35.899> your<00:06:35.990> pointer<00:06:36.229> finger<00:06:36.499> and<00:06:36.679> your

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:37.279 
you got your pointer finger and your

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.459 
you got your pointer finger and your
ring<00:06:37.429> finger<00:06:37.779> my<00:06:38.779> pointer<00:06:39.020> fingers<00:06:39.289> on<00:06:39.409> the

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
ring finger my pointer fingers on the

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.919 
ring finger my pointer fingers on the
fifth<00:06:39.770> fret<00:06:39.979> of<00:06:40.249> the<00:06:40.339> D<00:06:40.699> string<00:06:40.729> and<00:06:41.240> my<00:06:41.629> ring

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
fifth fret of the D string and my ring

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.199 
fifth fret of the D string and my ring
finger<00:06:42.319> is<00:06:42.589> on<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.889> seventh<00:06:43.669> fret<00:06:43.849> of<00:06:43.909> the<00:06:43.999> g

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:44.209 
finger is on the seventh fret of the g

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:45.609 
finger is on the seventh fret of the g
string<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:44.959> we're<00:06:45.080> going<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.229> keep<00:06:45.439> that

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
string and we're going to keep that

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.649 
string and we're going to keep that
shape<00:06:45.860> but<00:06:46.369> I<00:06:46.429> kind<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.639> explain<00:06:47.059> it<00:06:47.240> using<00:06:47.539> my

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
shape but I kind of explain it using my

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.540 
shape but I kind of explain it using my
pointer<00:06:48.139> finger<00:06:48.169> on<00:06:48.439> the<00:06:48.649> D<00:06:48.800> string<00:06:48.830> to<00:06:49.069> market

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
pointer finger on the D string to market

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.059 
pointer finger on the D string to market
and<00:06:49.729> so<00:06:50.240> essentially<00:06:51.050> it's<00:06:51.259> just<00:06:51.409> going<00:06:51.589> it's

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
and so essentially it's just going it's

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:58.449 
and so essentially it's just going it's
just<00:06:52.159> sliding<00:06:52.550> up<00:06:52.879> from<00:06:53.509> seven<00:06:57.189> on<00:06:58.189> the<00:06:58.279> back

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:58.459 
just sliding up from seven on the back

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:02.109 
just sliding up from seven on the back
beat<00:06:58.879> to<00:06:59.569> nine<00:06:59.779> back<00:07:00.769> to<00:07:00.919> seven<00:07:01.279> it<00:07:01.939> does

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:02.119 
beat to nine back to seven it does

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:13.410 
beat to nine back to seven it does
that's<00:07:02.269> why<00:07:02.539> she

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.670 

back<00:07:13.840> to<00:07:14.020> 9<00:07:14.230> and<00:07:14.620> then<00:07:14.860> it<00:07:14.950> is<00:07:15.100> gradually

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
back to 9 and then it is gradually

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.300 
back to 9 and then it is gradually
sliding<00:07:17.680> back<00:07:17.940> 5<00:07:18.940> or<00:07:18.970> D<00:07:19.510> so<00:07:19.810> this<00:07:20.740> repeats<00:07:21.130> that

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
sliding back 5 or D so this repeats that

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.710 
sliding back 5 or D so this repeats that
while<00:07:21.670> the<00:07:21.760> vocals<00:07:22.090> are<00:07:22.210> doing<00:07:22.420> a<00:07:22.510> pretty

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
while the vocals are doing a pretty

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.150 
while the vocals are doing a pretty
similar<00:07:23.050> melody<00:07:23.440> along<00:07:23.650> with<00:07:23.830> the<00:07:23.890> guitar

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
similar melody along with the guitar

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.620 
similar melody along with the guitar
part<00:07:24.430> or<00:07:24.550> so

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:37.700 

you

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:37.710 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.469 

pretty<00:07:38.710> basic<00:07:38.919> parts<00:07:39.400> of<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:39.639> song<00:07:39.879> and<00:07:40.270> I<00:07:40.419> was

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
pretty basic parts of the song and I was

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.670 
pretty basic parts of the song and I was
going<00:07:40.629> to<00:07:40.689> play<00:07:40.840> along<00:07:41.080> with<00:07:41.259> it<00:07:41.439> so<00:07:41.470> you<00:07:41.560> can

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
going to play along with it so you can

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.869 
going to play along with it so you can
kind<00:07:41.770> of<00:07:41.860> see<00:07:42.039> what<00:07:42.159> my<00:07:42.220> hands<00:07:42.460> are<00:07:42.580> doing<00:07:42.639> I'll

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 
kind of see what my hands are doing I'll

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.969 
kind of see what my hands are doing I'll
do
