00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
dishonored I've basically heard that few

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.330 
dishonored I've basically heard that few
people<00:00:09.240> were<00:00:09.960> having<00:00:10.139> trouble<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.800> third

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
people were having trouble in the third

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
people were having trouble in the third
mission<00:00:11.700> trying<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.150> find<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> art<00:00:12.570> dealers

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
mission trying to find the art dealers

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.259 
mission trying to find the art dealers
key<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:14.130> isn't<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> fairly<00:00:14.670> obvious<00:00:15.120> location

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
key it isn't a fairly obvious location

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.910 
key it isn't a fairly obvious location
but<00:00:15.719> obviously<00:00:16.109> some<00:00:16.289> people<00:00:16.379> would<00:00:16.710> go

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
but obviously some people would go

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.290 
but obviously some people would go
completely<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.730> ways<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> is

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
completely different ways so it is

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230 
completely different ways so it is
completely<00:00:18.510> miscible<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.170> well<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> thought

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
completely miscible as well so I thought

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.029 
completely miscible as well so I thought
I<00:00:21.270> would<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.449> show<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.750> video<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.320> where<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
I would just show this video on where to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.929 
I would just show this video on where to
find<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.820> key<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
find the key and how to get it so this

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
find the key and how to get it so this
will<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.810> third<00:00:28.289> mission<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.400> was

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
