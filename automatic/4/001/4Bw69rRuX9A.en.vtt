00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
building that I created and I couldn't

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.209 
building that I created and I couldn't
really<00:00:15.260> think<00:00:15.349> of<00:00:15.469> any<00:00:15.619> better<00:00:15.709> name<00:00:16.010> for<00:00:16.039> it

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.189 
biggest thing I've built so far so let's
take<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.760> look<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.269> it's<00:00:41.420> nestled<00:00:41.750> between<00:00:41.870> two

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
take a look and it's nestled between two

take a look and it's nestled between two
giant<00:00:42.559> mountains<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:45.430> I'll<00:00:46.430> check<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.089> out

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
giant mountains and I'll check it out

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.130 
giant mountains and I'll check it out
and<00:00:48.159> before<00:00:49.159> we<00:00:49.400> go<00:00:49.489> in<00:00:49.790> up<00:00:50.330> here<00:00:50.780> there's<00:00:50.930> like

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
and before we go in up here there's like

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.869 
and before we go in up here there's like
this<00:00:51.260> little<00:00:51.350> area<00:00:51.680> where<00:00:51.920> archers<00:00:52.549> could

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
this little area where archers could

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.049 
this little area where archers could
fire<00:00:53.780> down<00:00:54.019> at<00:00:54.199> some<00:00:54.320> people<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:57.670> wreak<00:00:58.670> havoc
