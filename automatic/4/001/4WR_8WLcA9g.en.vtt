00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
you can see out here now pan around a

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.540 
you can see out here now pan around a
thorough<00:00:22.990> island<00:00:23.530> you'll<00:00:23.980> be<00:00:24.130> able<00:00:24.190> to<00:00:24.340> see

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
thorough island you'll be able to see

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.580 
thorough island you'll be able to see
that<00:00:24.760> in<00:00:25.150> fact<00:00:25.390> there's<00:00:25.750> some<00:00:25.960> huts<00:00:26.140> out<00:00:26.350> there

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
that in fact there's some huts out there

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.080 
that in fact there's some huts out there
already<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.100> can<00:00:30.580> see<00:00:30.760> whether<00:00:30.970> it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
already and so I can see whether it's

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.700 
already and so I can see whether it's
been<00:00:31.210> machinery<00:00:31.750> dragging<00:00:32.169> them<00:00:32.259> out<00:00:32.380> so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
been machinery dragging them out so

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.970 
been machinery dragging them out so
there<00:00:32.890> must<00:00:32.980> be<00:00:33.160> good<00:00:33.340> ice<00:00:33.930> good<00:00:34.930> block<00:00:35.410> solid

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.940 
there must be good ice good block solid
ice<00:00:36.130> too<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.600> doubt<00:00:37.930> it's<00:00:38.170> going<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.410> get<00:00:38.800> any

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950
