00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

doing<00:00:00.359> work<00:00:00.870> underwater<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:02.300> fun<00:00:03.300> and

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
doing work underwater is fun and

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.660 
doing work underwater is fun and
interesting<00:00:04.410> but<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.770> also<00:00:04.920> takes<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.460> lot<00:00:05.609> of

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
interesting but it also takes a lot of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.810 
interesting but it also takes a lot of
planning<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.509> preparation<00:00:07.130> I<00:00:08.130> think<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
planning and preparation I think the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.000 
planning and preparation I think the
first<00:00:09.090> thing<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.420> people<00:00:10.080> realize<00:00:10.650> when

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
first thing that people realize when

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.220 
first thing that people realize when
you're<00:00:11.130> trying<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.610> work<00:00:11.820> underwater<00:00:12.360> when

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
you're trying to work underwater when

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
you're trying to work underwater when
you<00:00:13.380> get<00:00:13.740> under<00:00:14.040> water<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.910> can't

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you get under water is that you can't

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
you get under water is that you can't
talk<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.500> you're<00:00:16.830> working<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.279> your

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
talk and so you're working with your

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
talk and so you're working with your
friends<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.240> your<00:00:18.770> collaborators<00:00:19.770> or

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
friends or your collaborators or

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.679 
friends or your collaborators or
colleagues<00:00:21.230> other<00:00:22.230> scientists<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.689> you

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
colleagues other scientists and you

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
colleagues other scientists and you
can't<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.560> communicate<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:26.760> by

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
can't really communicate other than by

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
can't really communicate other than by
waving<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.720> hands<00:00:28.050> around<00:00:28.260> underwater

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
waving your hands around underwater

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.150 
waving your hands around underwater
giving<00:00:29.550> signals<00:00:30.150> or<00:00:30.800> certainly<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.040> knew

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
giving signals or certainly if you knew

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
giving signals or certainly if you knew
sign<00:00:32.399> language<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.149> very

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
sign language that would be very

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.910 
sign language that would be very
beneficial<00:00:34.280> but<00:00:35.280> usually<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
beneficial but usually we just kind of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
beneficial but usually we just kind of
you<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> write<00:00:38.520> everything<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.600> if

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you have to write everything down so if

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.880 
you have to write everything down so if
you're<00:00:39.930> trying<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> communicate<00:00:40.500> something

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you're trying to communicate something

have to carry underwater paper and
pencils<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.660> pens<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.200> work<00:00:49.320> underwater

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
pencils or pens that can work underwater

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.790 
pencils or pens that can work underwater
because<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> can't<00:00:50.579> talk<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.629> knowing<00:00:52.620> that

all your gear and you know make sure

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.969 
all your gear and you know make sure
that<00:01:23.040> you've<00:01:23.189> got<00:01:23.220> everything<00:01:24.619> there's<00:01:25.619> many

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that you've got everything there's many

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
that you've got everything there's many
cases<00:01:26.610> where<00:01:27.060> you'll<00:01:27.299> forget<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.990> weight

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
cases where you'll forget your weight

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.630 
cases where you'll forget your weight
belts<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.460> wear

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
belts or something you have to wear

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
belts or something you have to wear
weights<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:30.420> diving<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:31.040> our

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
weights when you go diving because our

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
weights when you go diving because our
bodies<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.729> buoyant<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bodies are buoyant and so you have to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
bodies are buoyant and so you have to
wear<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> weight<00:01:34.320> belt<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> helps<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.250> sink

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
wear a weight belt that helps you sink

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.920 
wear a weight belt that helps you sink
down<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> bottom<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.810> not

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
down to the bottom so that you're not

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.130 
down to the bottom so that you're not
constantly<00:01:37.320> drifting<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> surface<00:01:39.140> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
constantly drifting up to the surface so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
constantly drifting up to the surface so
once<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.860> gear<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.640> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
once you have all your gear and you have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
once you have all your gear and you have
all<00:01:42.000> your<00:01:42.150> equipment<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.780> everybody's<00:01:43.229> been

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
all your equipment and everybody's been

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.319 
all your equipment and everybody's been
assigned<00:01:43.890> their<00:01:44.189> task<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> finally

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
assigned their task then you finally

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.100 
assigned their task then you finally
jump<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> water<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:47.509> depending<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.659> where

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
jump in the water and depending on where

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.190 
jump in the water and depending on where
you<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:50.030> oftentimes<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.570> jump<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.960> water

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you are oftentimes we jump in the water

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950 
you are oftentimes we jump in the water
at<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.710> places<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.460> islands<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> people

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
at some places some islands that people

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
at some places some islands that people
have<00:01:55.079> never<00:01:55.229> been<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.189> first<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
have never been and the first thing you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.690 
have never been and the first thing you
do<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> your<00:01:57.719> eyes<00:01:57.930> bulge<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.549> head

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
do is your eyes bulge out of your head

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
do is your eyes bulge out of your head
and<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.719> overwhelmed<00:02:01.290> without

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and you are so overwhelmed without

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.219 
and you are so overwhelmed without
beautiful<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
beautiful it is that you kind of

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
beautiful it is that you kind of
sometimes<00:02:04.229> forget<00:02:04.740> oh<00:02:04.890> yeah<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.219> carrying

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
sometimes forget oh yeah I'm carrying

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.920 
sometimes forget oh yeah I'm carrying
all<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> equipment<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.540> better<00:02:06.719> pay

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
all this equipment I better pay

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
all this equipment I better pay
attention<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.649> doing<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> jump

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
attention to what I'm doing so you jump

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.110 
attention to what I'm doing so you jump
in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> water<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.470> let<00:02:11.160> air<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> your

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in the water and you let air out of your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.720 
in the water and you let air out of your
buoyancy<00:02:12.569> compensating

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
buoyancy compensating

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.619 
buoyancy compensating
which<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.209> kind<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> life<00:02:15.739> preserver

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
which is kind of like a life preserver

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.759 
which is kind of like a life preserver
so<00:02:17.629> that<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.050> sink<00:02:18.349> down<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> bottom

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
so that you can sink down to the bottom

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.589 
so that you can sink down to the bottom
and<00:02:19.280> then<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.000> bottom<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
and then when you get to the bottom you

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.619 
and then when you get to the bottom you
have<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.650> careful<00:02:22.040> not<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.629> dragging

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
have to be careful not to be dragging

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.449 
have to be careful not to be dragging
yourself<00:02:24.019> all<00:02:24.260> across<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.980> corrals

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
yourself all across the corrals

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.250 
yourself all across the corrals
everything's<00:02:26.060> alive<00:02:26.420> down<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.200> you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
everything's alive down there so you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.559 
everything's alive down there so you
have<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> little<00:02:28.550> bit<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.879> air<00:02:29.090> back<00:02:29.360> in

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
have to put a little bit of air back in

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.690 
have to put a little bit of air back in
your<00:02:29.750> your<00:02:30.110> buoyancy<00:02:30.560> compensator<00:02:31.130> device<00:02:31.459> so

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
your your buoyancy compensator device so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.100 
your your buoyancy compensator device so
that<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.880> float<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.450> above<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> surface

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that you float just above the surface

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.820 
that you float just above the surface
and<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:35.209> then<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:36.470> all<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:36.739> equipment

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
and and then you get all your equipment

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.920 
and and then you get all your equipment
and<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.340> start<00:02:37.610> working

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
and you start working

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.130 
and you start working
it's<00:02:39.470> always<00:02:39.709> funny<00:02:40.099> because<00:02:40.930> people<00:02:41.930> though

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's always funny because people though

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.020 
it's always funny because people though
you<00:02:42.500> don't<00:02:42.680> necessarily<00:02:42.890> remember<00:02:43.519> that

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
you don't necessarily remember that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.240 
you don't necessarily remember that
things<00:02:44.330> are<00:02:44.810> buoyant<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> could<00:02:45.860> open

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
things are buoyant so you could open

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.949 
things are buoyant so you could open
your<00:02:46.310> bag<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.700> has<00:02:47.209> all<00:02:47.390> your<00:02:47.540> supplies<00:02:47.930> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
your bag that has all your supplies in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.070 
your bag that has all your supplies in
it<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.500> we're<00:02:49.280> often<00:02:49.430> collecting<00:02:50.269> samples<00:02:50.780> of

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
it and we're often collecting samples of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.979 
it and we're often collecting samples of
little<00:02:51.739> corals<00:02:52.099> or<00:02:52.340> little<00:02:52.640> seaweeds<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.390> we

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
little corals or little seaweeds and we

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.620 
little corals or little seaweeds and we
use<00:02:54.230> ziplock<00:02:54.650> bags<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.220> collect<00:02:55.489> those<00:02:55.640> well

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
use ziplock bags to collect those well

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.479 
use ziplock bags to collect those well
the<00:02:56.989> baggies<00:02:57.380> are<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:57.980> buoyant<00:02:58.340> so

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
the baggies are going to be buoyant so

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.890 
the baggies are going to be buoyant so
the<00:02:58.610> second<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.000> open<00:02:59.030> your<00:02:59.360> bag<00:02:59.450> everything

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the second you open your bag everything

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.630 
the second you open your bag everything
goes<00:03:00.230> flying<00:03:00.500> up<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.829> surface<00:03:01.130> your

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
goes flying up to the surface your

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.880 
goes flying up to the surface your
pencils<00:03:02.150> gone<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.780> all<00:03:03.019> of<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.500> sudden<00:03:03.530> you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
pencils gone and all of a sudden you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.069 
pencils gone and all of a sudden you
have<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.099> garage<00:03:04.400> sale<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:05.390> things<00:03:05.660> floating

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
have a garage sale of things floating

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.789 
have a garage sale of things floating
away<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> surface<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.190> we<00:03:07.940> do<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> lot<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
away on the surface so we do a lot of

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.289 
away on the surface so we do a lot of
you<00:03:09.799> know<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> will<00:03:10.220> maybe<00:03:10.670> happen<00:03:11.060> on<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
you know that will maybe happen on the

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.650 
you know that will maybe happen on the
first<00:03:11.510> dive<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.410> first<00:03:12.709> day<00:03:13.459> of<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:14.510> big

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
first dive of the first day of a big

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.229 
first dive of the first day of a big
long<00:03:14.930> trip<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.410> then<00:03:15.530> everybody<00:03:16.239> remembers

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
long trip and then everybody remembers

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.970 
long trip and then everybody remembers
how<00:03:17.510> everything<00:03:17.989> goes<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.530> work<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.859> out

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
how everything goes and you work it out

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.710 
how everything goes and you work it out
but<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.970> often<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.900> game<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:22.510> search<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
but it often is a game of search and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.160 
but it often is a game of search and
recovery<00:03:24.319> for<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.920> first<00:03:25.190> few<00:03:25.489> dives<00:03:26.170> but

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
recovery for the first few dives but

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.240 
recovery for the first few dives but
then<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.500> work<00:03:27.620> underwater

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
then to work underwater

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.940 
then to work underwater
you<00:03:29.060> know<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.420> sound<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.170> said<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.500> can't

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
you know the sound like I said you can't

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.910 
you know the sound like I said you can't
talk<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:32.420> sound<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.019> feels<00:03:33.230> almost<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.650> your

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
talk the sound it feels almost like your

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.780 
talk the sound it feels almost like your
head<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.519> fishbowl<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:37.670> very

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
head is in a fishbowl it's it's very

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.830 
head is in a fishbowl it's it's very
quiet<00:03:39.010> unless<00:03:40.010> you're<00:03:40.760> fortunate<00:03:41.180> enough<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
quiet unless you're fortunate enough to

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.479 
quiet unless you're fortunate enough to
be<00:03:41.959> diving<00:03:42.350> in<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.530> place<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.280> Hawaiian

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
be diving in a place like the Hawaiian

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.970 
be diving in a place like the Hawaiian
Islands<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.329> winter<00:03:44.870> when<00:03:45.680> all<00:03:45.829> the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
Islands in the winter when all the
