00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
moves up as an extension when I find it

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.389 
moves up as an extension when I find it
actually<00:00:21.310> throw<00:00:21.759> away<00:00:22.000> -<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.200> me<00:00:23.349> there<00:00:23.529> get<00:00:24.369> a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
bit of shoulder stability going on and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.670 
bit of shoulder stability going on and
so<00:00:27.189> forth<00:00:27.579> can't<00:00:28.169> you<00:00:29.169> don't<00:00:29.259> want<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.529> have<00:00:29.619> to

next up push up I dump it up push ups to
the<00:01:20.350> background<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.130> we're<00:01:21.250> doubling<00:01:21.490> before

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the background so we're doubling before

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.560 
the background so we're doubling before
so<00:01:24.180> weights<00:01:25.180> just<00:01:25.510> those<00:01:25.750> die<00:01:25.930> shoulders<00:01:27.570> feet

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
so weights just those die shoulders feet

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.190 
so weights just those die shoulders feet
about<00:01:28.950> shoulder<00:01:29.950> width<00:01:30.070> apart<00:01:30.100> or<00:01:30.700> wire<00:01:31.200> gonna

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
about shoulder width apart or wire gonna

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:44.770 
about shoulder width apart or wire gonna
push<00:01:32.350> up<00:01:32.700> stabilize<00:01:33.930> pull

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.790 

now<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.050> tough<00:01:46.260> I've<00:01:46.440> seen<00:01:46.680> these

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
now this is tough I've seen these

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.130 
now this is tough I've seen these
weights<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.570> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> move<00:01:48.750> around<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.020> bit

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
weights right kind of move around a bit

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.970 
weights right kind of move around a bit
so<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.980> key<00:01:50.010> we've<00:01:50.610> done<00:01:50.820> before<00:01:51.830> where<00:01:52.830> the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
so the key we've done before where the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.730 
so the key we've done before where the
weights<00:01:53.190> are<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.700> touching<00:01:54.710> base<00:01:55.710> with

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
weights are like this touching base with

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520 
weights are like this touching base with
supports<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.580> better<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.660> one<00:01:57.900> here<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
supports a bit better this one here a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
supports a bit better this one here a
lot<00:01:59.460> tougher<00:01:59.700> because<00:01:59.910> now<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.480> weights<00:02:00.810> are

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
lot tougher because now the weights are

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.130 
lot tougher because now the weights are
out<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.470> long<00:02:02.460> run<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.910> stability<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
out here long run for stability now is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.770 
out here long run for stability now is
required<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.280> stabilize<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.660> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
required to stabilize you and if you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.090 
required to stabilize you and if you
find<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.080> one<00:02:07.260> foot<00:02:07.500> comes<00:02:07.680> off<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.950> floor

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
find that one foot comes off the floor

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.430 
find that one foot comes off the floor
that's<00:02:08.910> okay<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.260> try<00:02:10.350> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's okay what you want to try to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
that's okay what you want to try to
bring<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.710> back<00:02:10.890> down<00:02:11.130> keep<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> nice<00:02:12.240> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
bring that back down keep a nice and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.010 
bring that back down keep a nice and
balanced<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.440> again<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:15.020> six

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
balanced so again it's going to be six

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.520 
balanced so again it's going to be six
on<00:02:16.170> each<00:02:16.200> arm<00:02:16.440> 12<00:02:16.860> Global's<00:02:17.280> or<00:02:17.430> down-up

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
on each arm 12 Global's or down-up

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.570 
on each arm 12 Global's or down-up
stabilize<00:02:20.060> pull<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.780> core<00:02:22.020> strong

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
stabilize pull back the core strong

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.180 
stabilize pull back the core strong
don't<00:02:23.580> twist<00:02:24.950> okay<00:02:25.950> 12<00:02:26.490> -<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> toughy

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
don't twist okay 12 - that's a toughy

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.230
