the<00:00:03.350> animation<00:00:03.949> industry<00:00:04.100> that<00:00:04.819> you<00:00:05.000> would

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:05.149 
the animation industry that you would

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:07.780 
the animation industry that you would
tell<00:00:05.390> and<00:00:06.319> you<00:00:06.529> could<00:00:06.680> know<00:00:07.069> what's<00:00:07.460> going<00:00:07.730> on

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
tell and you could know what's going on

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.910 
tell and you could know what's going on
there<00:00:08.149> so<00:00:08.660> we'll<00:00:09.200> start<00:00:09.500> getting<00:00:09.559> to

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
there so we'll start getting to

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.500 
there so we'll start getting to
financing<00:00:10.400> those<00:00:10.520> things<00:00:10.790> I<00:00:11.030> mean<00:00:11.270> what's

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
financing those things I mean what's

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.260 
financing those things I mean what's
going<00:00:11.780> on<00:00:11.900> with<00:00:12.080> those<00:00:12.199> ones<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:13.340> i'll<00:00:13.969> start

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
going on with those ones so i'll start

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.240 
going on with those ones so i'll start
getting<00:00:14.449> now<00:00:14.900> into<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.440> easiest<00:00:15.859> part<00:00:16.070> which

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
getting now into the easiest part which

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.570 
getting now into the easiest part which
is<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:16.609> curves<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.770> right<00:00:18.949> here<00:00:19.160> what<00:00:19.400> we<00:00:19.550> have

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
is the curves so right here what we have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.919 
is the curves so right here what we have
it<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:20.960> that<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:22.240> first<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.390> all<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.599> one<00:00:23.779> that

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 
it is that a first of all the one that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.409 
it is that a first of all the one that
it's<00:00:24.019> on<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.320> ground<00:00:24.699> rather<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:25.970> has<00:00:26.179> to<00:00:26.359> be

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
it's on the ground rather it has to be

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.659 
it's on the ground rather it has to be
flat<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:26.929> it<00:00:27.079> slows<00:00:27.320> out<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:27.919> slow<00:00:28.130> sins<00:00:28.460> right

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
flat so it slows out and slow sins right

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.450 
flat so it slows out and slow sins right
here<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.329> this<00:00:30.320> ones<00:00:30.589> that<00:00:30.740> are<00:00:30.829> flat<00:00:31.130> like

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
here and this ones that are flat like

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.970 
here and this ones that are flat like
that<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.970> just<00:00:32.509> make<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.689> continues<00:00:33.320> with<00:00:33.620> that

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
that I just make it continues with that

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.130 
that I just make it continues with that
icon<00:00:34.489> right<00:00:34.670> here<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.660> just<00:00:35.810> keeps<00:00:36.020> on

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
icon right here so it just keeps on

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.500 
icon right here so it just keeps on
going<00:00:36.290> in<00:00:36.530> ever<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:36.950> he<00:00:37.040> never<00:00:37.190> stops<00:00:37.670> this

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
going in ever and he never stops this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.090 
going in ever and he never stops this
one<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:38.750> do<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.080> same<00:00:39.110> these<00:00:39.590> ones<00:00:39.710> are<00:00:39.830> quick

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
one I do the same these ones are quick

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.470 
one I do the same these ones are quick
changes<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.030> now<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.270> can<00:00:41.630> see<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:43.610> go<00:00:44.000> and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
changes and now we can see if I go and

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.870 
changes and now we can see if I go and
create<00:00:45.350> that<00:00:45.710> cycle<00:00:46.310> a<00:00:47.650> great<00:00:48.650> body<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.100> post<00:00:49.520> I

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
create that cycle a great body a post I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.980 
create that cycle a great body a post I
mean<00:00:50.570> also<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.940> priests<00:00:52.940> icon<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:53.630> now<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:53.810> can

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
mean also the priests icon so now we can

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.490 
mean also the priests icon so now we can
see<00:00:54.200> how<00:00:54.410> things<00:00:54.440> are<00:00:54.950> being<00:00:56.320> connected<00:00:57.320> right

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
see how things are being connected right

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.410 
see how things are being connected right
here<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.250> how<00:00:58.400> why<00:00:58.700> this<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:59.180> so

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
here so this is how why this is so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.050 
here so this is how why this is so
useful<00:00:59.720> if<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.770> go<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.220> play<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:01.490> this<00:01:01.820> one

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
useful if I go and play with this one

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.760 
useful if I go and play with this one
like<00:01:02.240> that<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:02.690> can<00:01:02.810> see<00:01:03.140> how<00:01:03.320> that's<00:01:03.560> going

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
like that now I can see how that's going

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.160 
like that now I can see how that's going
to<00:01:03.830> hook<00:01:03.950> up<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:04.970> if<00:01:05.119> i<00:01:05.269> go<00:01:05.509> back<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.780> frame

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to hook up and if i go back to frame

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.190 
to hook up and if i go back to frame
number<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:07.299> sorry<00:01:08.299> from<00:01:08.539> another<00:01:08.719> 20<00:01:09.170> right

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
number one sorry from another 20 right

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.569 
number one sorry from another 20 right
here<00:01:09.679> i<00:01:09.859> did<00:01:10.729> i<00:01:10.880> just<00:01:10.909> played<00:01:11.420> by<00:01:12.579> visually

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
here i did i just played by visually

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.309 
here i did i just played by visually
keeps<00:01:13.820> trying<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.149> connect<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.749> into<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
keeps trying to connect that into the

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.099 
keeps trying to connect that into the
same<00:01:18.319> curve<00:01:18.679> that<00:01:19.579> I<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.999> right<00:01:20.210> here<00:01:20.270> so

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
same curve that I have right here so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.050 
same curve that I have right here so
this<00:01:21.289> is<00:01:21.469> why<00:01:21.679> this<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:22.039> so<00:01:22.219> useful<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
this is why this is so useful so that

this is why this is so useful so that
was<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.659> middle<00:01:24.100> section<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.729> tale<00:01:26.270> I

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
was the the middle section of the tale I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.200 
was the the middle section of the tale I
work<00:01:27.499> on<00:01:27.679> this<00:01:27.799> one<00:01:27.979> also<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.609> get<00:01:28.819> more

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.729 
first frame try to hook it up like this
one<00:02:11.659> this<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.019> seems<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.379> fine<00:02:12.590> i'm<00:02:12.709> just

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
one this one seems to fine i'm just

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.330 
one this one seems to fine i'm just
going<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:12.980> modify<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> last<00:02:13.640> one

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
going to modify the last one

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.850 
going to modify the last one
so<00:02:14.640> he<00:02:14.700> hooks<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.060> nicely<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:16.440> trying<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> see

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
so he hooks up nicely just trying to see

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.500 
so he hooks up nicely just trying to see
that<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.099> has<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.250> nice<00:02:17.780> flow<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:20.510> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
that it has a nice flow right there so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.710 
that it has a nice flow right there so
something<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.110> would<00:02:22.260> work<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.769> now

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
something like that would work for now

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.140 
something like that would work for now
let's<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.290> looks<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.940> small

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
let's see how it looks just a small

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.630 
let's see how it looks just a small
changes<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> animation<00:02:28.200> curve<00:02:31.640> so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
changes on the animation curve so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.100 
changes on the animation curve so
something<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.510> actually<00:02:33.690> works

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
something like that it actually works

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.850 
something like that it actually works
pretty<00:02:34.200> pretty<00:02:34.860> well<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:36.629> main<00:02:36.810> change<00:02:37.620> for

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
pretty pretty well the main change for

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.070 
pretty pretty well the main change for
those<00:02:38.010> months<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.720> having

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
those months it is that it is having

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.070 
those months it is that it is having
that<00:02:40.200> slow<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.739> slow<00:02:41.099> out<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.870> looks

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
that slow in slow out and it looks

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.920 
that slow in slow out and it looks
pretty<00:02:43.260> cool<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.640> could<00:02:44.970> say<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.720> this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
pretty cool you could say that that this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.400 
pretty cool you could say that that this
is<00:02:46.110> working<00:02:46.579> but<00:02:47.579> again<00:02:47.849> if<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.120> look<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.720> from

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
is working but again if we look it from

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.710 
is working but again if we look it from
an<00:02:49.650> animation<00:02:50.069> point<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.849> view<00:02:51.000> especially

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
an animation point of view especially

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.009 
an animation point of view especially
classical<00:02:52.470> animation<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.989> animators<00:02:54.989> that

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
classical animation or animators that

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.259 
classical animation or animators that
they<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.680> they're<00:02:56.130> doing<00:02:56.459> this

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
they really know what they're doing this

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.690 
they really know what they're doing this
is<00:02:57.510> actually<00:02:57.989> still<00:02:58.459> getting<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> be<00:02:59.670> a<00:03:00.299> very<00:03:01.110> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
is actually still getting to be a very a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.390 
is actually still getting to be a very a
computer<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:04.410> computer<00:03:04.829> desk<00:03:05.040> or

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
computer like for computer desk or

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.740 
computer like for computer desk or
electronic<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:07.049> it's<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:08.750> smooth

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
electronic because it's so smooth

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080 
electronic because it's so smooth
there's<00:03:10.590> things<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.129> we<00:03:11.459> need<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.640> apply<00:03:12.030> to

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
there's things that we need to apply to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.759 
there's things that we need to apply to
this<00:03:12.329> one<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.660> I'll<00:03:12.780> save<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.170> scene<00:03:13.379> right

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
this one so I'll save the scene right

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.059 
this one so I'll save the scene right
here<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.390> start<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.780> frame<00:03:16.079> by<00:03:16.200> frame<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
here and I start going frame by frame so

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.379 
here and I start going frame by frame so
one<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> things<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.730> happening<00:03:17.849> here

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
one of the things that is happening here

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.349 
one of the things that is happening here
is<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.480> there's<00:03:19.470> no<00:03:19.650> there's<00:03:20.069> no<00:03:20.130> delay<00:03:20.730> for

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
is that there's no there's no delay for

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.180 
is that there's no there's no delay for
the<00:03:22.160> change<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.459> shape<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.230> then<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.920> start

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the change of a shape and then we start

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.550 
the change of a shape and then we start
getting<00:03:26.639> into<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.120> little<00:03:27.690> bit<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.049> line<00:03:28.380> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
getting into a little bit of a line of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920 
getting into a little bit of a line of
action<00:03:28.829> here<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.700> what's<00:03:29.880> happening<00:03:30.329> here<00:03:30.389> it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
action here so what's happening here it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
action here so what's happening here it
is<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> line<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.250> action<00:03:32.609> right

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
is that we have a line of action right

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.490 
is that we have a line of action right
there<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.430> let's<00:03:35.430> say<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.819> that's<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
there this is let's say that that's a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.920 
there this is let's say that that's a
c-shape<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.340> letter<00:03:38.579> C<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.780> can

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
c-shape it is the letter C as you can

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
c-shape it is the letter C as you can
see<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.319> right<00:03:40.500> there<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.639> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
see that right there so this is a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.909 
see that right there so this is a
c-shape<00:03:42.480> line<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.930> action<00:03:43.260> going<00:03:45.919> forward

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
c-shape line of action going forward

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.180 
c-shape line of action going forward
this<00:03:47.639> is<00:03:47.790> going<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.030> change<00:03:48.319> on<00:03:49.319> frame<00:03:50.389> 12<00:03:52.190> so

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
this is going to change on frame 12 so

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.620 
this is going to change on frame 12 so
this<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.700> river<00:03:54.030> east<00:03:55.880> sea<00:03:56.880> shape<00:03:57.180> for

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
this is the river east sea shape for

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.390 
this is the river east sea shape for
that<00:03:57.660> same<00:03:57.989> line<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.319> action<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.799> mean

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that same line of action I mean

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.849 
that same line of action I mean
somewhere<00:03:59.819> in<00:03:59.970> frames<00:04:00.239> six<00:04:00.750> we<00:04:01.380> need<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.680> have

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
somewhere in frames six we need to have

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.509 
somewhere in frames six we need to have
what<00:04:02.099> we<00:04:02.220> call<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:03.049> s-curve<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.370> I'll<00:04:05.370> do

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
what we call the s-curve and I'll do

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.190 
what we call the s-curve and I'll do
that<00:04:05.669> with<00:04:05.819> red<00:04:06.060> coloring<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:06.959> need<00:04:07.079> to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
that with red coloring so we need to

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.280 
that with red coloring so we need to
have<00:04:07.349> something<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:13.109> as

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
have something like this like that so as

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.930 
have something like this like that so as
you<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.500> see<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> computer<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.459> not<00:04:14.639> really

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
you can see the computer is not really

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.039 
you can see the computer is not really
giving<00:04:15.180> us<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.780> s<00:04:16.049> shape<00:04:17.720> for<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.810> line<00:04:18.930> of

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
giving us that s shape for the line of

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.979 
giving us that s shape for the line of
action<00:04:19.349> so<00:04:19.859> every<00:04:20.250> time<00:04:20.280> we<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.389> change<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
action so every time we have a change of

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.800 
action so every time we have a change of
direction<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:23.550> can<00:04:23.789> use<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.390> principle

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
direction we can use this principle

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.850 
direction we can use this principle
to<00:04:26.020> find<00:04:26.530> where<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.960> what<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.500> shape

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
to find where that is what that is shape

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.570 
to find where that is what that is shape
is<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.510> I'll<00:04:31.690> give<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.130> break<00:04:33.130> down<00:04:33.340> here

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
is and I'll give you a break down here

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.950 
is and I'll give you a break down here
so<00:04:33.760> if<00:04:33.940> we<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.270> c-shaped<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.200> there<00:04:36.960> we

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
so if we have a c-shaped right there we

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.379 
so if we have a c-shaped right there we
want<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.230> go<00:04:38.320> from<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.650> shape<00:04:39.040> into<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.150> one

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
want to go from that shape into this one

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.080 
want to go from that shape into this one
now<00:04:40.540> which<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.900> reverse<00:04:41.230> shape<00:04:42.090> somewhere

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
now which is a reverse shape somewhere

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.260 
now which is a reverse shape somewhere
in<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.510> middle<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:44.500> need<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.860> have<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.370> S

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
in the middle we need to have that S

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.110 
in the middle we need to have that S
shape<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:47.440> can<00:04:47.710> be<00:04:48.100> shaped<00:04:48.400> like<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.880> one

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
shape it can be shaped like this one

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.190 
shape it can be shaped like this one
like<00:04:49.990> an<00:04:50.169> S<00:04:50.320> or<00:04:50.650> wiki<00:04:51.160> Tiki<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.730> be

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
like an S or wiki Tiki it can be

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.550 
like an S or wiki Tiki it can be
reversed<00:04:53.200> i<00:04:53.590> s<00:04:54.340> meaning<00:04:55.300> something<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> Z

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
reversed i s meaning something like a Z

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.590 
reversed i s meaning something like a Z
but<00:04:56.950> it's<00:04:57.070> more<00:04:57.220> like<00:04:57.400> an<00:04:57.490> S<00:04:57.669> right<00:04:58.300> there<00:04:58.479> it's

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
but it's more like an S right there it's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.430 
but it's more like an S right there it's
just<00:04:58.690> flipped<00:04:59.470> horizontally
