00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
we could have that we could work on we

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.840 
we could have that we could work on we
can<00:01:44.690> do<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> little<00:01:45.020> bit<00:01:45.170> better<00:01:45.350> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
can do a little bit better the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.950 
can do a little bit better the
participants<00:01:46.850> could<00:01:47.090> put<00:01:47.509> in<00:01:47.630> their<00:01:47.810> two

participants could put in their two
cents<00:01:48.229> if<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:49.520> think<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:49.880> would<00:01:50.060> be

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
cents if you like we think this would be

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.180 
cents if you like we think this would be
a<00:01:50.270> good<00:01:50.479> idea<00:01:50.630> too<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.470> could<00:01:51.680> take

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
a good idea too and then we could take

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.340 
a good idea too and then we could take
that<00:01:52.340> into<00:01:52.399> consideration<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.450> maybe<00:01:54.110> add

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
that into consideration and maybe add

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:13.059 
that into consideration and maybe add
that<00:01:54.530> into<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:55.070> well

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.030 

I<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:14.989> are<00:02:15.019> two<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.499> rewarding

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I think there are two really rewarding

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.179 
I think there are two really rewarding
parts<00:02:16.310> one<00:02:16.609> is<00:02:16.640> getting<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.329> meet<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.859> lot<00:02:18.859> of

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
parts one is getting to meet a lot of

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.099 
parts one is getting to meet a lot of
people<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.670> end<00:02:19.939> up<00:02:20.180> being<00:02:20.359> lifelong

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
people that end up being lifelong

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.530 
people that end up being lifelong
friends<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.739> then<00:02:22.189> the<00:02:23.060> other<00:02:23.209> thing<00:02:23.510> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
friends and then the other thing is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.539 
friends and then the other thing is
coming<00:02:24.379> off<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.739> stage<00:02:24.950> at<00:02:25.189> the<00:02:25.280> end<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.489> a

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
coming off the stage at the end of a

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.959 
coming off the stage at the end of a
performance<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.299> having<00:02:26.599> people<00:02:27.639> say<00:02:28.639> good

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
performance and having people say good

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.990 
performance and having people say good
things<00:02:28.999> about<00:02:29.359> your<00:02:29.569> performance<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:31.000> be
