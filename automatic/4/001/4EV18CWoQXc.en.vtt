00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
to say is that I I think before every

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.910 
to say is that I I think before every
episode<00:03:55.360> say<00:03:56.230> Madine<00:03:56.500> having<00:03:56.740> this<00:03:56.800> little

intro where they talk about the episode
and<00:03:58.720> uh<00:03:59.340> cos<00:04:00.340> related<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> show<00:04:01.030> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and uh cos related to the show the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.400 
and uh cos related to the show the
actual<00:04:01.570> show<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.900> think<00:04:02.080> but<00:04:02.920> uh<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:04.990> they<00:04:05.230> said

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
actual show I think but uh it they said

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.690 
actual show I think but uh it they said
don't<00:04:06.150> try<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.210> make<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.540> think<00:04:07.750> like<00:04:07.930> it's

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
don't try to make it think like it's

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.520 
don't try to make it think like it's
actual<00:04:09.700> following<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.270> main<00:04:10.450> story<00:04:10.750> from<00:04:11.350> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
actual following the main story from the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.800 
actual following the main story from the
TV<00:04:11.800> shows<00:04:11.950> because<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.310> not<00:04:12.490> it's<00:04:13.420> taking

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
TV shows because it's not it's taking

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.210 
TV shows because it's not it's taking
what<00:04:13.960> there<00:04:14.080> is<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.440> diving<00:04:14.560> deeper<00:04:15.040> it's

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
what there is and diving deeper it's

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.010 
what there is and diving deeper it's
taking<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.700> two<00:04:15.850> different<00:04:16.000> route<00:04:16.390> but

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
taking it in two different route but

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.150 
taking it in two different route but
it's<00:04:17.170> still<00:04:17.290> basically<00:04:17.530> taking<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.010> same

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
it's still basically taking you the same

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.979 
it's still basically taking you the same
direction<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.850> they're<00:04:19.420> changing<00:04:19.660> things<00:04:19.870> up

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
direction but they're changing things up

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:20.539 
direction but they're changing things up
a<00:04:20.080> bit

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
a bit

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.330 
a bit
which<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.670> kind<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:21.880> like<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.060> kind<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.510> makes<00:04:22.780> me

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
which I kind of like it kind of makes me

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.470 
which I kind of like it kind of makes me
dig<00:04:24.340> deeper<00:04:24.550> into<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.730> story<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.060> find<00:04:25.330> out

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
dig deeper into the story and find out

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.630 
dig deeper into the story and find out
what<00:04:25.630> these<00:04:25.750> critters<00:04:25.990> are<00:04:26.260> really<00:04:27.250> like<00:04:27.400> more

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
what these critters are really like more

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.380 
what these critters are really like more
I<00:04:27.700> guess<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.810> uh<00:04:28.870> there's<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.880> don't

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
I guess but uh there's that I don't

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.360 
I guess but uh there's that I don't
think<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:31.630> saw<00:04:32.260> social<00:04:32.620> features<00:04:32.950> let<00:04:33.130> me<00:04:33.220> see

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
think I saw social features let me see

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.890

what<00:04:33.490> those<00:04:33.640> are<00:04:33.850> real<00:04:34.000> quick<00:04:34.180> didn't

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
what those are real quick didn't

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.990 
what those are real quick didn't
probably<00:04:35.200> should<00:04:35.290> have<00:04:35.320> read<00:04:35.470> those<00:04:36.000> all

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
probably should have read those all

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.290 
probably should have read those all
right<00:04:37.120> they're<00:04:37.330> scratch<00:04:37.750> or<00:04:37.900> features<00:04:39.270> okay<00:04:40.270> I
