00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello how good today as you see by the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 cited what I come with a comparative three 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.170
 products that seem a lot to me and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 that are of different prices and that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'm going to say they're clones I'm not going to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.119
 say that they are cousins brothers I'm not going to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.029
 say that they are reasonable similar 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:26.720
 I will say that they are of characteristics 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.720
 very similar and that are interchangeable 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.380
 let's start the first one that I had 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.900
 is the archifamous or the archifamous cream 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.940
 eight hours of elisabeth arden this was coming 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.840
 with a cosmopolitan magazine if not 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.989
 I remember badly one or two years ago two 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.570
 only better hotels even this cream 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.180
 of this color as a half orange 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.250
 a smell of impressive rays but that 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.220
 it's wonderful especially for what 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.699
 you want lips cuticles when you have 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.610
 skin very dry wounds or nose a 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.989
 little avoided is great but I 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.760
 I have the original in large size 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.119
 let's say the original in the sense of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.299
 Big size cost me 16 euros in 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.290
 strawberry dot net and I do not recommend that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.150
 you buy it because there are alternatives 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 cheaper equally effective 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.090
 Then my life came here from a garden 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 I bought it for myself and we go to haunt 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 the seven euros and brings 50 grams 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.600
 and it is a cream of the same 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.600
 Features is a restorative cream 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 intensive 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.110
 in this case it has no value and is very 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.180
 dense just like that of Elizabeth Arden 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.840
 and it's transparent transparent 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.090
 whitish transparent rather well and it's 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.540
 a cream with the same uses let 's say it 's 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.540
 for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.650
 if you can see how you see it is like 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.230
 fat on the skin because it's like 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.230
 fatty and is to throw them on the lips 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.300
 in the nose wounds skin dry skin with 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.200
 scales knows more things like cuticles 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.830
 that kind of thing is very good 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.459
 and it is a bit cheaper than 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.629
 previous and it goes just as well I'm not going to 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.150
 talk about components because it's about 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.129
 example does not bring them here pointed is what 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.740
 typical contact the manufacturer if 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.720
 he wants to know the ingredients 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.720
 and this one starts with a thousand- dollar petrolatum 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.540
 all-in and for liquid end and this type 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 of things like that a little uglier and we're not going 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.680
 to talk about that because you have 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.790
 information on the internet and the latest 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.310
 is I think it cost 22 euros or so 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.630
 that's it I bought it would make up and 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 will be the olive ointment is the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.920
 olive ointment that after 20 milliliters 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.460
 you see that every time we go to more sizes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.490
 small and 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.530
 here they are called as an ointment apply 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.520
 on the skin and loving it properly what 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.980
 others was a bad translate 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.720
 and it's more of the same this has a 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 a little bit more yellow but it's the same 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.070
 equally emtusa and with the same 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.860
 benefits let's say the previous ones in 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.440
 As for smell, do not touch it. Have a 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.270
 Of course, there is no smell 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.040
 like elizabeth arden's and is are 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.160
 comparable because the three more or less 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.790
 they do the same thing they have that same texture 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.490
 dense and have nothing to do with it 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.440
 at prices but nothing nothing to see I 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.600
 I would stay with this one 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.840
 If you order online if you have a store 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.630
 near and in any case then with the bea 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.570
 quad that brings good farmer one 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.880
 50 grams this had 20 milliliters if 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.200
 Bring enough more if you do not find it 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.750
 from yaya or if for whatever it is we just 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.400
 convince the olive theme or the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.470
 ingredients although good simply you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.120
 I say they have to be all bad 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.530
 maybe find it easier in 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 any drugstore pharmacy what 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.260
 it's wuthering but good out there 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.840
 they go there and nothing was what I 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.470
 I wanted to teach that basically it's a 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.380
 little what what I can check 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.700
 that these three then for what was more 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.430
 or less does the same thing and that of s 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.190
 elizabeth arden I recommend you more to 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.380
 the best for what cuticles are 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.390
 because it is farther from the face because 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.590
 the smell impresses a lot and goes to the 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 lips is sometimes done a little bit 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.900
 unpleasant 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.060
 and any of the other two do not have 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.770
 no problem I have applied them to me 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.590
 the lips and I have not had any 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.509
 problem is also more treat them 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.020
 very much on top of any of 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.550
 any lipstick gives you a little more 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.830
 glossy texture and a little bit more 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.080
 hydration so I want to think that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.449
 with any of them you are just as 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.220
 well but as it is a cream that 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.639
 you do not really use it, you are not going to use it 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.080
 tons to the best with that of yan is already 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.610
 more comfortable because you put it even in 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.949
 the bag these guys can serve 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.810
 lip balm because it's more comfortable more 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.289
 But the other one is going 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.810
 a little bit more to a big size and 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.110
 good unless the offer a lot look 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.640
 in the end better does not make up for that much 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.500
 they are a type of we think that also 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.790
 you can use as spot masks 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.010
 when you have a little area 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.480
 reddened that he has made me leave it 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.080
 there maybe one hour two hours and 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.330
 then he washes my face and I see that he has 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.330
 done quite effect in that time is 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.070
 as for the cuticles also in the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.320
 hands whatever you have some dry areas 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.450
 you put it is very uncomfortable in the hands 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.340
 because it is very dense and very pasty and very 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.870
 sticky and there but the truth is that 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.370
 it's magical because you leave it and then 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.280
 you notice and the truth is that super skin 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.070
 soft and already much more hydrated concert 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.920
 I wear nail the circus confetti 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.230
 he not of the flow forgiveness of that is that 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.790
 I always confuse these marks of 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.010
 essence that I do not know if not even six 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.250
 great listed I do not just put that way 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.180
 from the middle of the nails towards the tip 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.650
 because I love this effect 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.350
 psychedelic draws a lot of attention 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.550
 and even if I miss a nail because 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.889
 I have already skipped some for some 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.900
 corner is not noticeable 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.729
 it does not feel as much as if the sun is on 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.590
 color and it really takes them from a 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.060
 color and missing a bit then they are 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.699
 very comfortable to wear, I recommend you 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.779
 that you try them so nothing 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.409
 so far this video that I roll up 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.879
 very much and thank you for being there and not 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.020
 you ask me about this makeup 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.599
 because I have already done it 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.830
 so nothing I leave you and see you in the 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.830
 next dragon video
