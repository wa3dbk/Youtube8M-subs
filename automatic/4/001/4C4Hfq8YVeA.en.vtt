to fight and we had him on a very basic

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.560 
to fight and we had him on a very basic
program<00:00:41.350> after<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.430> then<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:43.120> changed<00:00:43.330> up

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
program after that and then I changed up

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.689 
program after that and then I changed up
a<00:00:43.660> little<00:00:43.870> bit<00:00:43.989> what<00:00:44.290> about<00:00:44.379> three<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.430> before

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
a little bit what about three so before

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.790 
a little bit what about three so before
I<00:00:45.730> came<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.089> Puerto<00:00:46.449> Rico<00:00:46.690> sir<00:00:46.870> get<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> good

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
I came in to Puerto Rico sir get a good

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.259 
I came in to Puerto Rico sir get a good
base<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.220> we<00:00:48.309> start<00:00:48.550> off<00:00:48.670> with<00:00:48.820> just<00:00:49.120> being

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
base that we start off with just being

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.979 
base that we start off with just being
definitely<00:00:50.229> helps<00:00:50.409> us<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.589> lot<00:00:51.299> was<00:00:52.299> it<00:00:52.479> was<00:00:52.869> it

definitely helps us a lot was it was it
your<00:00:53.170> decision<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.830> start<00:00:54.190> early<00:00:54.330> not<00:00:55.330> only<00:00:55.720> me

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
your decision to start early not only me

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.180 
your decision to start early not only me
how<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.500> know<00:00:56.619> it's<00:00:56.739> been<00:00:56.860> very<00:00:57.010> proactive

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
how you know it's been very proactive

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.380 
how you know it's been very proactive
with<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.549> lot<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.729> things<00:00:57.970> in<00:00:58.119> the<00:00:58.180> training

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
with a lot of things in the training

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.609 
with a lot of things in the training
which<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.750> good<00:00:58.930> on<00:00:59.049> you<00:00:59.110> realizes<00:00:59.530> the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
which is good on you realizes the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:00.869 
which is good on you realizes the
benefits<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.159> it<00:01:00.339> but<00:01:00.460> some<00:01:00.549> of<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.729> work<00:01:00.850> that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
I've done by hand so I know we sat down

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
I've done by hand so I know we sat down
we<00:01:04.089> spoke<00:01:04.299> about<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:05.130> then<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.220> would

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
we spoke about it and then you would

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.490 
we spoke about it and then you would
like<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.420> put<00:01:08.110> something<00:01:08.409> together

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
like to this and put something together

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.609 
like to this and put something together
that's<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:09.520> I'm<00:01:09.700> too<00:01:09.820> pretty<00:01:09.939> well<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:11.320> him

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
that's what I'm too pretty well now him

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.760 
that's what I'm too pretty well now him
starting<00:01:12.070> early<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.580> is<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:14.320> make<00:01:14.500> weight

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
starting early on is it to make weight

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.770 
starting early on is it to make weight
or<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.220> because<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.759> guys<00:01:15.790> see<00:01:16.240> Cotto<00:01:16.540> as<00:01:16.750> a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
or is it because you guys see Cotto as a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.780 
or is it because you guys see Cotto as a
tough<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.380> mean<00:01:17.619> code<00:01:17.830> excuse<00:01:18.159> me<00:01:18.280> Manny<00:01:18.490> as<00:01:18.729> a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
tough opponent no nothing and the way it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.510 
tough opponent no nothing and the way it
is<00:01:21.250> going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.460> be<00:01:21.520> fun<00:01:21.730> we<00:01:22.420> started<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.900> chem

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
is going to be fun we started the chem

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.040 
is going to be fun we started the chem
pretty<00:01:24.520> much<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.850> me<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.150> know<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.420> were<00:01:25.840> no

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
pretty much for me you know we were no

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.480 
pretty much for me you know we were no
be<00:01:26.200> comfortable<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:26.650> there's<00:01:27.070> no<00:01:27.160> issues<00:01:27.430> with

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
be comfortable so there's no issues with

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.010 
be comfortable so there's no issues with
the<00:01:27.610> weights<00:01:27.790> at<00:01:27.910> all<00:01:28.830> yes<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:30.160> know<00:01:30.250> me

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the weights at all yes you know me

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.730 
the weights at all yes you know me
I<00:01:32.179> think<00:01:33.179> this<00:01:33.659> obviously<00:01:34.289> it's<00:01:34.409> been<00:01:34.469> quite

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
I think this obviously it's been quite

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
I think this obviously it's been quite
illegal<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> he's<00:01:35.340> trained<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:35.939> training

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
illegal and he's trained by training

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
illegal and he's trained by training
officers<00:01:36.899> it's<00:01:37.079> pretty<00:01:37.229> focused<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.679> staying

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
officers it's pretty focused in staying

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
officers it's pretty focused in staying
focused<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.179> it's<00:01:39.329> good<00:01:39.679> what<00:01:40.679> are<00:01:40.799> some

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
focused and so it's good what are some

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
focused and so it's good what are some
of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> things<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> work<00:01:42.450> on

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
of the things you are going to work on

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.550 
of the things you are going to work on
to<00:01:42.929> try<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.320> code<00:01:43.860> already<00:01:44.039> for<00:01:44.369> many

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
to try to get code already for many

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
to try to get code already for many
things<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.740> you'd<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.069> just<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> little

things if you'd like to just a little
bit<00:01:47.969> obvious<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> big

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
bit obvious you know one of the big

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.949 
bit obvious you know one of the big
things<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> super<00:01:50.039> so<00:01:50.250> does<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.959> many

things that super so does this is many

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.319 
things that super so does this is many
speed<00:01:52.380> which<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.250> drill<00:01:53.459> work<00:01:54.179> at

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
speed which we need to drill work at

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.029 
speed which we need to drill work at
least<00:01:54.689> address<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.469> couple<00:01:55.860> of
