in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.240> Val<00:01:09.689> show<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> great<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
in the Val show and it's a great way to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
in the Val show and it's a great way to
add<00:01:11.520> photo<00:01:12.150> quality<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.900> innovation<00:01:13.680> which

add photo quality and innovation which

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
add photo quality and innovation which
