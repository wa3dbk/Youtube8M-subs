 distracting events soon players need to 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 you learn how to deal with crowds 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.670
 read about possible game activities 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.899
 For example, discover the group in 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.179

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.690
 our mysterious murder missions 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.660
 let's take a look now into the house 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 for the first time without interruption we 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 add this mission to our list 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.390
 and continue towards the goal 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.220
 remember paris is located 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.540
 in the middle of the revolution and everyone 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 moment it could be street fighting 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.170
 the people you see will be the people 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 here against the aggressors the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 enemy faction in atu we mix 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:38.480
 us not only times we have a our 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.489
 goal is in a society club 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.239
 a new type of spor in the action 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.420
 the hcd 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.180
 we have to try somehow 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.459
 we fight it right first is one 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.440
 htu much more demanding and you 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.350
 All your skill must be your devices 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.900
 and new fighting techniques are used 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.359
 we now see enough barriers 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 frame and heavier attack and with 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.880
 With the help of this means we want the fight 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.310
 win 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.380
 but we are not done yet 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.180
 see what is waiting for us inside many 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.489
 Parisian buildings are seamless 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.769
 enter what many new game situations 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.049
 make possible the second floor 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.430
 even more against we switch to 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.200
 they sneak in and try 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.139
 a non-lethal approach 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.209
 For the first time in Assassin's creed 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.680
 we have a special sleep mode of per 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.109
 button pressure is activated 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 in sleep mode they are harder too 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.430
 discover 1 can bypass opponents 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.430
 she lads from cover to cover 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.930
 our goal hides in the third 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.930
 let's go upstairs 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.050
 that 's good 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.209
 it seems our goal is not here 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.889
 we go to the palais diagram Thies 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.539
 and feel it on the skyline of paris 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.250
 and he is one on one scale of the city 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.130
 lend to the navigation in the game 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
 completely new feeling 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.639
 around the assassin on roofs one 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.130
 we have that advantage 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.660
 feature plateau introduced so recognize 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.250
 we quickly change the game options 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 us around while we move 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.620
 Taverns are social 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.510
 Collect points that give you a series of 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.120
 To offer possibilities you can do things 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:04.680
 buy or coop missions 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:06.600
 to thrust food became this 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.460
 The revolution is slowly becoming scarce 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.650
 and these people are arguing about it 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.240
 cereals we could get involved 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.240
 but for now we will continue for now 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.610
 The street is being attacked 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.740
 blocks the enemy faction 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.120
 we can not fight it that would 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.919
 attract the protectors 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.020
 and we are not strong enough yet 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.960
 push back, we let him go for now 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.210
 out of the way by going to this wall 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.710
 the crowds wants the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.400
 public executions by the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.199
 guillotine at 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.540
 We have to find our goal 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.790
 eagle eye use one in the moment 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.919
 temporary ability for us 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.919
 have not unlocked the power 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.050
 our goal kapitÃ¤ns ag is making its way 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.190
 away to the guillotine with the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.830
 to begin execution 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.580
 as we are in the crowd 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.650
 invisible 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.790
 we have many options for ours 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.250
 to turn off the target 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.010
 we can use the phantom sword 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.080
 a new assassin threw a ruden 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.300
 stunning bomb to our new 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.130
 to test pleasure abilities and 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.050
 get close to him 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.180
 We make it a warning to the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.410
 templar and shape this execution 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.410
 as public as possible
