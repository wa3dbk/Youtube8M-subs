because there is water in a banana
firstly<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:22.040> need<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.220> dry<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.600> what<00:01:23.750> we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
firstly we need to dry this so what we

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.200 
firstly we need to dry this so what we
do<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.200> after<00:01:24.440> we<00:01:24.680> mash<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.070> truth<00:01:25.280> we<00:01:25.940> put<00:01:26.119> him

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
do is after we mash the truth we put him

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.380 
do is after we mash the truth we put him
in<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.360> bag<00:01:26.540> like<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:27.770> one<00:01:27.979> here<00:01:28.360> with<00:01:29.360> a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
in a bag like this one here with a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.480 
in a bag like this one here with a
bundle<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.900> banana<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.470> will<00:01:30.650> take<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.979> 15

bundle of banana it will take you 15
days<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:32.030> dry<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.740> after<00:01:33.740> its<00:01:33.830> dried<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:34.729> put

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
days to dry it after its dried we put

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.530 
days to dry it after its dried we put
him<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.180> here<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:37.100> leaves<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.700> will<00:01:37.850> take<00:01:38.060> 50

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
him in here the leaves it will take 50

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.289 
him in here the leaves it will take 50
to<00:01:38.659> 100<00:01:39.110> lives<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.530> wrap<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.830> food<00:01:39.979> up<00:01:40.299> the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
to 100 lives to wrap the food up the

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.200 
to 100 lives to wrap the food up the
leaves<00:01:41.600> can<00:01:41.840> only<00:01:42.020> last<00:01:42.320> up<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.500> seven<00:01:42.799> months

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
leaves can only last up to seven months

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.760 
leaves can only last up to seven months
but<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.330> food<00:01:44.540> can<00:01:44.750> still<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.170> for<00:01:45.350> four<00:01:45.560> years

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
but the food can still be for four years

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.460 
but the food can still be for four years
or<00:01:45.920> more<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.030> reason<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.750> dry

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
or more and the reason is that dry

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.010 
or more and the reason is that dry
banana<00:01:48.830> become<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:49.340> an<00:01:49.490> old<00:01:49.670> cheese<00:01:49.909> or<00:01:50.750> blue

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
banana become like an old cheese or blue

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.380 
banana become like an old cheese or blue
vein<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.250> what<00:01:52.549> we<00:01:52.729> left<00:01:52.909> over<00:01:53.210> with

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
vein that is what we left over with

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.429 
vein that is what we left over with
after<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> cyclone

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.120 

two<00:01:58.439> years<00:01:58.679> later<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.990> bring<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
two years later you bring this up you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.749 
two years later you bring this up you
lose<00:02:02.310> everything

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
lose everything

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999

Carla flavor everything you lose but the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
Carla flavor everything you lose but the
nutrients<00:02:05.490> still<00:02:05.759> remain<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.960> other<00:02:07.140> thing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
nutrients still remain one other thing

why say this we are raised for the taste

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.670 
why say this we are raised for the taste
to<00:02:43.110> survive

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to survive

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.759 
to survive
never<00:02:44.160> ever<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.629> test<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:46.530> how<00:02:46.709> we

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
never ever go for the test that's how we

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.860 
never ever go for the test that's how we
surely<00:02:47.069> survive<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.030> reason<00:02:54.329> why<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.599> had

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you're living in a big island you can

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.839 
you're living in a big island you can
see<00:03:15.299> much<00:03:15.480> change<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.430> live<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
see much change but if you live in a

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.180 
see much change but if you live in a
tiny<00:03:18.060> island<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.510> us<00:03:18.840> there<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> big

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
tiny island like us there is a big

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.809 
tiny island like us there is a big
change

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
change

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.930 
change
four<00:03:21.630> years<00:03:21.810> ago<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:22.170> miss<00:03:22.319> him<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.790> we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
four years ago we miss him out and if we

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.870 
four years ago we miss him out and if we
continue<00:03:24.180> missing<00:03:24.720> Vanuatu<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:26.430> cyclone

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
continue missing Vanuatu the cyclone

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.270 
continue missing Vanuatu the cyclone
Vanuatu<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.169> will<00:03:28.349> lose<00:03:28.530> Vanuatu

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
Vanuatu we will lose Vanuatu

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.000 
Vanuatu we will lose Vanuatu
why<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.819> said<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.870> cycling<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.530> important

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
why I said is the cycling so important

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.860 
why I said is the cycling so important
you<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.609> lot<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.819> damage<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.660> truth

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you do a lot of damage that's the truth

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.259 
you do a lot of damage that's the truth
but<00:03:34.169> there<00:03:34.950> are<00:03:35.069> advantages<00:03:35.430> about<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.849> cycle

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
but there are advantages about a cycle

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.349 
but there are advantages about a cycle
every<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.349> cycle<00:03:37.739> step<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.239> like

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
every the cycle step in it just like

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.539 
every the cycle step in it just like
somebody<00:03:39.690> walk<00:03:40.079> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.319> room<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
somebody walk in the room that's the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.909 
somebody walk in the room that's the
room<00:03:41.819> clings<00:03:42.630> there<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.290> everything<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.769> it

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
room clings there and everything in it

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.430 
room clings there and everything in it
that<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.549> why<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.760> islands<00:03:45.180> healthy<00:03:45.540> four

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that is why the islands healthy four

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.879 
that is why the islands healthy four
years<00:03:46.620> ago<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:47.549> hasn't<00:03:47.790> been<00:03:47.970> dust<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.799> you

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
years ago it hasn't been dust and if you

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.709 
years ago it hasn't been dust and if you
continue<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.340> way

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:54.719 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.910 

whatever<00:03:55.719> it<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.019> there's<00:03:56.469> a<00:03:56.560> tree<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.829> the

to the cyclone you will notice one thing
