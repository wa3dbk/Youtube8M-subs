City<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.979> mentors<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.460> stand<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
City the mentors are gonna stand out in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
City the mentors are gonna stand out in
the<00:01:17.909> middle<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the middle and what this does in this is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.740 
the middle and what this does in this is
my<00:01:20.070> theory<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> does<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
my theory I think what it does is it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.080 
my theory I think what it does is it
distributes<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> amount<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> people<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.939> one

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
distributes the amount of people in one

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
distributes the amount of people in one
spot<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.200> answer<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.979> tokoto<00:01:26.250> view

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
spot so now the answer in tokoto view

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
spot so now the answer in tokoto view
city<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.729> crashes<00:01:27.240> often<00:01:27.450> since<00:01:27.780> people

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
city one crashes often since people

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
city one crashes often since people
always<00:01:28.229> tend<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.939> stand<00:01:29.939> around

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
always tend to kind of stand around

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.490 
always tend to kind of stand around
their<00:01:30.240> mentors<00:01:30.600> being<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> temperate<00:01:31.140> obesity

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
their mentors being a temperate obesity

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
their mentors being a temperate obesity
which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.280> caused<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.729> lag<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
which is what caused the lag when you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
which is what caused the lag when you
try<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> enter<00:01:33.509> sometimes<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> sometimes<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
try to enter sometimes and sometimes the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.899 
try to enter sometimes and sometimes the
causes<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.220> answer<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.549> all

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
causes you to not answer at all

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
causes you to not answer at all
at<00:01:36.210> least<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.540> theory<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.500> changed

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
at least it's my theory but has changed

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
at least it's my theory but has changed
now<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.490> mentors<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
now so now the mentors are going to be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
now so now the mentors are going to be
waiting<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> middle<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> Tokyo<00:01:40.560> v

I<00:02:31.620> guess<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:31.950> rewarded<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.700> come

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
I guess you get rewarded if you come

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.240 
I guess you get rewarded if you come
across<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.450> quitter<00:02:33.720> which<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.860> step<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
across a quitter which is a step in the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.840 
across a quitter which is a step in the
right<00:02:35.340> direction

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
right direction

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.250 
right direction
I<00:02:35.880> still<00:02:36.390> say<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> quit<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.140> should

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
I still say if you quit you should

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.450 
I still say if you quit you should
probably<00:02:37.410> lose<00:02:37.590> some<00:02:37.620> points<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.190> at<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
probably lose some points then at the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
now kind of has a more straightforward

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.199 
now kind of has a more straightforward
arc<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.170> throw<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.700> you

what it does is when you throw super let

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.600 
what it does is when you throw super let
you<00:04:25.110> strike<00:04:25.320> out<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.770> kind<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.979> fires<00:04:26.250> it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
you strike out it kind of fires it

and you will dodge it a hundred percent
at<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> time<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.789> next<00:04:39.000> attack<00:04:39.240> they<00:04:39.449> got

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
at a time the next attack they got

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.510 
at a time the next attack they got
tweaked<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.080> key<00:04:40.289> blast<00:04:40.500> cannons<00:04:40.919> which<00:04:41.310> I

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
tweaked is key blast cannons which I

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.010 
tweaked is key blast cannons which I
really<00:04:42.060> didn't<00:04:42.210> hear<00:04:42.270> much<00:04:42.449> about<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:42.960> uh

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
really didn't hear much about but uh

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.860 
really didn't hear much about but uh
burglars<00:04:43.650> arrived<00:04:43.860> told<00:04:44.069> me<00:04:44.129> about<00:04:44.189> it<00:04:44.460> and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
burglars arrived told me about it and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.629 
burglars arrived told me about it and
key<00:04:45.870> box<00:04:46.020> cannon<00:04:46.379> now<00:04:46.560> has<00:04:46.860> knocked<00:04:47.219> back<00:04:47.430> on

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
key box cannon now has knocked back on

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.209 
key box cannon now has knocked back on
you<00:04:47.789> so<00:04:47.939> you<00:04:48.030> can't<00:04:48.240> really<00:04:48.389> travel<00:04:49.219> combo

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
you so you can't really travel combo

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:51.529 
you so you can't really travel combo
with<00:04:50.400> other<00:04:50.610> moves<00:04:50.879> which<00:04:51.030> apparently<00:04:51.270> was<00:04:51.479> a

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
with other moves which apparently was a

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:52.879 
with other moves which apparently was a
pretty<00:04:51.870> open<00:04:52.169> move<00:04:52.469> now

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
pretty open move now

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.529 
pretty open move now
so<00:04:53.129> if<00:04:53.189> you<00:04:53.310> try<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> pull<00:04:53.729> out<00:04:53.789> key<00:04:54.000> box<00:04:54.120> cannon

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
so if you try to pull out key box cannon

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.879 
so if you try to pull out key box cannon
it's<00:04:54.960> gonna<00:04:55.050> fire<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.409> across<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.710> screen

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
it's gonna fire you across the screen

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.100 
it's gonna fire you across the screen
but<00:04:56.580> that's<00:04:56.849> about<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.240> for<00:04:57.539> now<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.689> mean<00:04:58.020> I

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
but that's about it for now I mean I

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.570 
but that's about it for now I mean I
don't<00:04:58.259> have<00:04:58.469> the<00:04:58.620> full<00:04:58.800> list<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.099> all<00:04:59.340> attacks

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
don't have the full list of all attacks

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.219 
don't have the full list of all attacks
too<00:04:59.909> much<00:05:00.000> week<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.360> requested<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.110> I

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
too much week I requested it but I

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.450 
too much week I requested it but I
haven't<00:05:01.379> gotten<00:05:01.590> yet<00:05:01.770> from<00:05:01.919> bond<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.189> lemco

haven't gotten yet from bond and lemco

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.129 
haven't gotten yet from bond and lemco
so<00:05:02.969> if<00:05:03.090> they<00:05:03.210> do<00:05:03.300> end<00:05:03.419> up<00:05:03.449> send<00:05:03.689> me<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> will
