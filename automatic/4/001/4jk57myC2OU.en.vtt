00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 Welcome back to league of legends 

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.200
 I introduce you to another child 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.210
 namely the guardian of the saints 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.680
 scanner and how do we get to first 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.680
 the dinos and then the space 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 that once got the boots and now come 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 we are beginning to sketch the one with the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.010
 coast / you see here you see 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 once this great mark on the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 opponents see the switch-off for free 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 gÃ¶rner and the zvs world christian 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 exoskeleton you have to have one too 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 zoom in a bit 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 because this is how it is on the scissors 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 small crystals that I find very cool 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.070
 really looks very cool 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 out 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.939
 the third hit we shoot 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 also project this again in the guardian 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.930
 of sense also looks very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 knock out and last but not least of course 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 the ultimate also here the opponent with 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.259
 sugar styling looks looks too 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 really very very bad 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.360
 I'll show you the todestage now 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.180
 I would say nation 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 that's what we're talking about here for manova 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 retreat and yes maybe still 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 important to say the skin becomes 975 riot 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 that means he will be exactly the same 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.900
 be expensive like the ramos I go 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 already introduced you there are still 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.509
 another guardian on distance 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.509
 I'll ask you, too 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.450
 the next time before the traction too 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.920
 very fancy and writes again diligently 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 in the comments what you from the skin 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 I think I'm cool for you, I wonder 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.110
 Although why more chaos now 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.229
 go out there because only the band 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610
 cascada came but my god I think for 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.189
 this radio still the sense theme 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.210
 Perfect looks really great 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.469
 the textures are very accurate and it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 is really fun to this team 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.659
 play 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 Of course, say goodbye 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.920
 again with treats skin pure
