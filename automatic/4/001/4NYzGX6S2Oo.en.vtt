science<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.059> math<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.390> i<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.629> it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
science and math because i think it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.830 
science and math because i think it's
like<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.410> basis<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.550> technology<00:00:48.239> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.020 

for<00:01:29.070> too<00:01:29.190> long<00:01:29.220> we've<00:01:29.610> looked<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:29.940> our

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
for too long we've looked at our

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.790 
for too long we've looked at our
students<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> put<00:01:31.080> them<00:01:31.230> into<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.770> two

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
students and put them into one of two

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.340 
students and put them into one of two
camps<00:01:32.400> either<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.420> were<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.720> science<00:01:34.110> math

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
camps either they were the science math

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520 
camps either they were the science math
is<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:35.010> they<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.030> creative<00:01:36.690> arts<00:01:36.840> kids

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
is or they are the creative arts kids

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.850 
is or they are the creative arts kids
and<00:01:38.630> watching<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.660> paradigm<00:01:40.320> begin<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and watching that paradigm begin to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
and watching that paradigm begin to
shift<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.430> ultimately<00:01:41.880> break<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.660> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
shift and ultimately break is so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.390 
shift and ultimately break is so
exciting<00:01:43.790> engineering<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> science<00:01:46.400> require

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
exciting engineering and science require

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.060 
exciting engineering and science require
you<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.360> look<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.870> world<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.560> figure<00:01:50.010> out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you to look at the world and figure out

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.250 
you to look at the world and figure out
how<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.460> change<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.300> there<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:52.020> more

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
how to change it and there is no more

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.740 
how to change it and there is no more
creative<00:01:52.830> act<00:01:53.010> than<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.420> math<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
creative act than that I like math and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.720 
creative act than that I like math and
science<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.410> involves<00:01:55.890> problem<00:01:56.310> solving

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
science because involves problem solving

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.700 
science because involves problem solving
and<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.270> challenging<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and I can be challenging I think it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
and I can be challenging I think it's
important<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.310> society<00:01:59.790> has<00:01:59.820> problem

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
important that society has problem

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.570 
important that society has problem
solvers<00:02:00.720> because<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.890> everyone<00:02:02.370> wants

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
solvers because not everyone wants

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.700 
solvers because not everyone wants
pretty<00:02:02.910> challenge<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:03.930> people

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
pretty challenge and so people

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.490 
pretty challenge and so people
really<00:02:06.220> far<00:02:06.370> cotton<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.390> guess<00:02:08.259> as<00:02:08.470> a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
really far cotton to go I guess as a

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070 
really far cotton to go I guess as a
tendon<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:09.690> faster<00:02:10.690> software

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
tendon is like I don't faster software

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.250 
tendon is like I don't faster software
for<00:02:11.230> computers<00:02:11.319> i<00:02:11.980> wouldnt<00:02:12.940> grab<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.390> jetpack<00:02:13.959> I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
for computers i wouldnt grab a jetpack I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.120 
for computers i wouldnt grab a jetpack I
would<00:02:14.740> do<00:02:14.920> something<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.490> help<00:02:17.130> the
