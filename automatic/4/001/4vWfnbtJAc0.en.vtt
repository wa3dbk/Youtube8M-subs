00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
 today we will talk about the most 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.240
 elusive heroes in dota i will talk about 5 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 characters which is easiest to get away from 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 harassment and which while doing so 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 don't just kill we try to compare those 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.250
 same escape mechanism is the most 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 reliable and efficient and so drove 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 skill set allows you to bring a lot 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 trouble to his enemies but one of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.739
 its distinguishing features are 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.759
 that itâ€™s not easy to kill letters 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.140
 disposal is 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.330
 iluza record which allows 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.400
 move up to 1800 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.530
 it is enough to be on 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.360
 safe distance from enemies but also 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.949
 while you have to shift out with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
 which you can easily dodge 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.970
 from almost anything or just 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 pinch in danger this skill 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.430
 possesses a small cool down and not even 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.140
 worth of mana 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.210
 but the most interesting part starts with 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 the appearance of a daguer with him so becomes 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.660
 incredibly mobile and worthwhile in combination 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 shift will be very difficult to catch 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.800
 the main drawback so far is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.539
 that for example, or at dawn, he flies 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 slow enough that it can sometimes 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 play a trick on us and not 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 having a daguer available or just on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.780
 early lagoons psf will not be so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780
 effective 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.640
 at first glance it may not seem 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 so elusive but let's 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 analyze his skills better with 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.520
 using the wave you can easily dodge 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.680
 any spell and also fast 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.750
 overcome a distance of 1000 units what 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 already quite good for running away besides 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.770
 thanks to the swap force kill marfa 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.910
 getting even more complicated so already on 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.580
 level eight can be restored 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.170
 currently up to 114 x n per second and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.270
 you can even activate the transfer 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 being in the camp already at this stage and 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.350
 kill marfa becomes very difficult 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.690
 however his most important weapon is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.550
 ulta making the illusion of an ally or enemy 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 we can fear almost nothing 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.619
 because we just need to click on 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.330
 ulta 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.880
 and we will instantly move into place 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 Our illusion can be taken in advance 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.660
 on the other end of the card for example to yourself 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 under the fountain and in this case even if us 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.810
 will be gun with several heroes then we 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.970
 we can with one click without any problems 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.710
 escape from prosecution precisely because 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.240
 all this skill is marketing rightfully 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.050
 can be considered one of the best and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.050
 dota skaters 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.380
 combines everything you need to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 to go out alive even the most deplorable 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.890
 situations he has an inviz who 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.480
 has a funny cool down 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.310
 and beyond that gives the maximum 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.530
 the speed of movement is even if 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.270
 you have a gene or wards, it is not at all 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.160
 mean you can catch it 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.870
 nasty bug and course 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.670
 complement the overall picture of his ulta 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.350
 which is able to move quickly 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 viber a long distance from their 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.580
 enemies but beyond that timelapse is also 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.250
 resets various debuffs and allows 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.390
 instantly regain lost health 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.459
 it turns out that in addition to a small stock 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.380
 the jeweler's life simply does not have serious 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.390
 flaws however there is a hero who 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.110
 surpasses even his ability to escape 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 from danger 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.310
 cut has incredible mobility and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.290
 may be there in seconds 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.150
 where no one is waiting for him with the help of ball 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.010
 lightning he can overcome quite 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.900
 impressive distances and the main thing is that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.819
 this skill works without flood 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.989
 thanks to this catch up feature 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.060
 the storm becomes practically 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.980
 impossible, and besides, in un-those he 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.750
 invulnerable so he can dodge 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.030
 any shot flying at him or 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.829
 the spell is the main minus of the storm 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.480
 is that his whole escape 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.189
 potential rests on his manap 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.139
 which before the appearance of items on 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:31.970
 intellect or regin will not allow it so 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:33.680
 I have often used the ulti skilled hands 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.870
 he is not only able to turn the outcome 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.060
 teamfight but also knows how to perfectly escape from 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.500
 sandstorm attacks possesses a small 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.180
 Caldauns we give us 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.829
 invisibility in which we can wait 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.510
 danger and with it we 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.459
 can dodge some tables 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.019
 besides burrow strike can also 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.030
 be used to escape if 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.709
 consider it as a blink 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.659
 the appearance of daguer catch scorpion 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.280
 it becomes even more difficult as 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.290
 there is always the opportunity to wait out three 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.970
 seconds in invise letting daguer roll back and 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.919
 calm blink of enemies 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.780
 however, the main disadvantage of sade king 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.760
 is that his inviz can 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.319
 interrupt any ouya camp and the enemies will 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.359
 know exactly where you are 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.280
 besides completely remove the potential 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.280
 revealed only after the purchase of Daguerre
