00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
in the kit first step you need to do is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.139 
in the kit first step you need to do is
take<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.590> seat<00:00:29.830> off<00:00:29.860> bike<00:00:32.610> most<00:00:33.610> bikes<00:00:33.910> are

take the seat off bike most bikes are

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.210 
take the seat off bike most bikes are
simple<00:00:34.660> they<00:00:34.960> just<00:00:35.170> have<00:00:35.320> one<00:00:35.350> bolt<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:36.070> on

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
simple they just have one bolt and on

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.750 
simple they just have one bolt and on
that<00:00:36.370> one<00:00:37.300> do<00:00:37.920> around<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.100> color<00:00:39.310> of<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.579> seat

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.170 
that one do around the color of the seat
back<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.150> it<00:00:40.930> falls<00:00:41.170> out<00:00:41.380> like<00:00:41.560> that<00:00:42.180> we're

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
back and it falls out like that we're

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.610 
back and it falls out like that we're
quite<00:00:43.270> fortunate<00:00:43.600> with<00:00:44.020> this<00:00:44.200> seat<00:00:44.410> base

quite fortunate with this seat base

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.560 
quite fortunate with this seat base
because<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.040> actually<00:00:45.160> tells<00:00:45.520> us<00:00:45.760> on<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.090> what

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
because it actually tells us on it what

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.549 
because it actually tells us on it what
size<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.620> one's<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:48.059> 25.4<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.320> kit

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
size it is this one's a 25.4 in the kit

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.340 
size it is this one's a 25.4 in the kit
we<00:00:51.130> have<00:00:51.160> three<00:00:51.610> sizes<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.180> can<00:00:52.360> use<00:00:52.600> there's<00:00:53.230> a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
we have three sizes we can use there's a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.380 
we have three sizes we can use there's a
twenty<00:00:53.680> two<00:00:53.890> twenty<00:00:54.399> five<00:00:54.640> point<00:00:54.910> four<00:00:55.180> and

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
twenty two twenty five point four and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.120 
twenty two twenty five point four and
the<00:00:55.899> clamp<00:00:56.170> actually<00:00:56.590> suits<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.950> 27<00:00:57.579> inch<00:00:57.670> bar

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
the clamp actually suits a 27 inch bar

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.229 
the clamp actually suits a 27 inch bar
so<00:01:00.130> to<00:01:00.520> put<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.790> on<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.629> simply<00:01:02.050> put<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.860> clamp

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so to put it on you simply put the clamp

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.870 
so to put it on you simply put the clamp
adapter<00:01:04.239> ring<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.899> clamp<00:01:05.670> face<00:01:06.670> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
adapter ring in the clamp face it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.350 
adapter ring in the clamp face it
