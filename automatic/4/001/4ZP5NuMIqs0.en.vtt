00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
okay just make sure to look for a bottle

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180

that<00:00:50.879> has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> tight<00:00:51.840> close<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:53.039> if

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that has a tight close to it because if

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
that has a tight close to it because if
it<00:00:53.309> doesn't<00:00:53.520> tightly<00:00:54.000> close<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.680> liquid

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it doesn't tightly close then the liquid

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.060 
it doesn't tightly close then the liquid
latex<00:00:56.399> will<00:00:56.879> dry<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.440> okay<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.770> might
