 ink on the side of the printer and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.210
 the same height as her which 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.369
 will be united by means of some 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.500
 special hoses that will transport 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.299
 the ink to each cartridge these

 to print 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.950
 hp we place the ink containers to

 in its correct position taking in 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.050
 Count the position of the hose with 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.239
 careful the cartridges are inches to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.280
 maintain the proper pressure and avoid the 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.680

 installation is similar 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.710
 first we put the containers of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.930
 ink on the side of the printer and 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.220
 the height of it which will be 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.440
 united by means of hoses 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.630
 special ones that transport the ink 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.070
 until each cartridge the cartridges are 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.930
 placed in their correct position 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.510
 taking into account the position of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 hose with care 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.099
 the cartridges are inches to keep 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.080
 the proper pressure you should only 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.090
 turn on the printer and automatically 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.459
 it is purged to avoid air inside 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.830
 the hoses once ready the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.739
 cartridges are placed and the printer is 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.269
