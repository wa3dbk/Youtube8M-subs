the<00:05:31.660> woods<00:05:32.880> my<00:05:33.880> hiking<00:05:34.090> shoes<00:05:34.270> were

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
the woods my hiking shoes were

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.860 
the woods my hiking shoes were
completely<00:05:35.110> caked<00:05:35.440> up<00:05:35.650> with<00:05:35.860> mud<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.720> had<00:05:37.720> to

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
completely caked up with mud so had to

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:46.260 
completely caked up with mud so had to
go<00:05:38.500> with<00:05:38.590> these<00:05:41.970> once<00:05:42.970> again<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.330> failed<00:05:45.270> it

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
go with these once again it failed it

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.350 
go with these once again it failed it
seems<00:05:46.510> to<00:05:46.600> fail<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> lot<00:05:47.020> during<00:05:47.229> batoning

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
seems to fail a lot during batoning

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.360 
seems to fail a lot during batoning
people<00:05:49.360> who<00:05:49.419> say<00:05:49.630> frame<00:05:49.990> locks<00:05:50.260> are<00:05:50.770> superior

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
people who say frame locks are superior

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.110 
people who say frame locks are superior
to<00:05:51.669> liner<00:05:52.090> locks<00:05:52.360> they<00:05:53.289> actually<00:05:53.620> right<00:05:54.120> but

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
to liner locks they actually right but

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.610 
to liner locks they actually right but
that<00:05:55.449> doesn't<00:05:55.840> mean<00:05:55.900> that<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.199> liner<00:05:56.380> lock

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
that doesn't mean that the liner lock

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.680 
that doesn't mean that the liner lock
still<00:05:56.919> isn't<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.250> good<00:05:57.370> locking<00:05:57.580> system<00:06:00.660> yeah

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
still isn't a good locking system yeah

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.980 
still isn't a good locking system yeah
when<00:06:02.349> introduced<00:06:02.710> to<00:06:02.860> shock<00:06:03.599> he<00:06:04.599> seems<00:06:04.870> to

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
when introduced to shock he seems to

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:12.240 
when introduced to shock he seems to
fail<00:06:05.229> a<00:06:05.560> lot<00:06:06.430> easier<00:06:06.910> than<00:06:07.150> a<00:06:07.240> frame<00:06:07.450> lock<00:06:11.250> it's

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
fail a lot easier than a frame lock it's

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:25.570 
fail a lot easier than a frame lock it's
still<00:06:12.520> working<00:06:12.700> really<00:06:13.000> well

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.530
