00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.370 
room but we like to put the Sal's in a
stall<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:12.440> here<00:02:13.240> because<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.630> sows<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.170> have

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
stall in here because the sows can have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.800 
stall in here because the sows can have
the<00:02:15.560> pigs<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.700> pigs<00:02:16.730> can<00:02:17.209> get<00:02:17.360> away<00:02:17.480> from

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
the pigs and the pigs can get away from

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.100 
the pigs and the pigs can get away from
the<00:02:17.959> sound<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.030> sound<00:02:20.300> doesn't<00:02:20.690> lay<00:02:20.870> down

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the sound so the sound doesn't lay down

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.460 
the sound so the sound doesn't lay down
on<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.470> pigs<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.120> pigs<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> place<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
on the pigs so the pigs have a place to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.710 
on the pigs so the pigs have a place to
roam<00:02:24.920> where<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.490> sow<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.690> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
roam where the sow is not and that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.230 
roam where the sow is not and that
provides<00:02:27.530> better<00:02:28.220> comfort<00:02:28.730> for<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> pigs

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
provides better comfort for the pigs

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.960 
provides better comfort for the pigs
more<00:02:29.510> survivability<00:02:30.140> for<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> pigs<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
more survivability for the pigs this is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.699 
more survivability for the pigs this is
the<00:02:32.060> best<00:02:32.240> system<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> sounds<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the best system the sounds like the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.520 
the best system the sounds like the
stalls<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.490> this<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.480> pigs<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:36.080> having

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
stalls like this the pigs like having

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.890 
stalls like this the pigs like having
access<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.430> Sal<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:37.970> being<00:02:38.180> able<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.510> get

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
access to the Sal but being able to get

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.060 
access to the Sal but being able to get
away<00:02:39.020> from<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.440> sound

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
away from the sound

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.860 
away from the sound
another<00:02:40.760> reason<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.570> keep<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
another reason we like to keep the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.660 
another reason we like to keep the
thousand<00:02:42.350> stalls<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.920> because<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.340> protects

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
thousand stalls is because it protects

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.340 
thousand stalls is because it protects
me<00:02:44.080> usually<00:02:46.420> sounds<00:02:47.420> when<00:02:47.989> they're<00:02:48.170> having

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
me usually sounds when they're having

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.640 
me usually sounds when they're having
pigs<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.760> be<00:02:49.940> very<00:02:50.180> aggressive<00:02:50.600> because<00:02:51.500> they

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
pigs can be very aggressive because they

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.130 
pigs can be very aggressive because they
want<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.860> protect<00:02:52.040> their<00:02:52.430> Pig<00:02:52.959> one<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.050> the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
want to protect their Pig one of the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.050 
want to protect their Pig one of the
things<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.500> like<00:02:54.709> about<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:55.190> stall<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.790> that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
things I like about the stall is that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.620 
things I like about the stall is that
you<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.300> provide<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.340> best<00:02:58.640> care<00:02:59.090> for<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
you can provide the best care for the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.350 
you can provide the best care for the
