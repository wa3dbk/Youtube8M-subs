00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 according to embrapa to produce thousand 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 kilos of grain it is necessary to provide 80 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.099
 of nitrogen for the crop to be 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.980
 biological nitrogen fixation dispenses 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 the supply of mineral fertilizer and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.410
 reducing production costs thanks to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.219
 to the process of biological fixation of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 nitrogen 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 we can do is make the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 Brazilian producer to spend less for 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.559
 produce at least 7 billion soybeans 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.110
 dollars annually in accordance with 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.719
 embrapa Brazil is the only country that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 can produce soy without adding 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 nitrogen fertilizer to soil 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.449
 the nutrient is supplied to the plant 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.609
 biological form by means of a bacterium 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 we have this bacterium that must be 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.000
 placed in contact with the seeds of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.490
 Soy 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.860
 there are two basic types of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 inoculant formulation on the market 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.659
 the tufah-based inoculant that the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 material very rich in organic matter 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.680
 is an inoculant that has been used for 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.799
 of 100 years a substrate really 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 perfect and the inoculant that the farmer 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.380
 than 80% today. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.960
 market is the liquid inoculant if the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.170
 seeds are treated with insecticides 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.740
 or index of inoculations should be made 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.880
 with a high concentration 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 of cells 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.289
 remembering the biological fixation of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.990
 increases the competitiveness of 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.950
 soybean because it reduces the costs of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.950
 mineral fertilizer 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:07.480
 the basf offering of that local camp 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.040
 there monsanto produce more conserve 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 more and improve lives and mitsubishi l200 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.920
 triton true strength and resistance
