00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 the rings 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 why this choice but why me 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:33.660
 like as a dj and a friend of mine everything 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 in short, I feel good about a brother as he is 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.350
 been your 2012 was a year 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.330
 fantastic because in any case ours 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.330
 evenings have always gone really well 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.410
 so we also have many dates 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.920
 that come with collaborations 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.300
 anyway looking also at your videos 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.760
 which, however, you always see, too, a 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.790
 do the interview as much as pleasure 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 like the situation and that's fine 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:24.570
 I am very happy with how it went 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:28.680
 2012 therefore in spite of the ig share crisis 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.940
 a success but the crisis is fake but 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.820
 because the crisis is fake because why me 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.160
 I think it's fake it's mine it's one thing 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.670
 because I see what happens anyway 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.830
 around if there was really a crisis 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.950
 local crisis crises can always empty 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.480
 even with any dj but no 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.480
 so for me it's fake 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.129
 giusy consoles not only dj but for the gip 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.829
 costume organizer arts I have to do 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.599
 all going appears the look do that 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.189
 think that thinking about that other than 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.430
 buy discs think what should i do 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.799
 sound like I think I have to stay a lot 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.889
 quiet with the mind because if not not 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.799
 I can do things so let's say that 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.159
 it is very tiring but I love it but it is 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.159
 however , my job and I would change it 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.300
 in short, nobody knows what this is all about 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.950
 with 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.950
 so he says with nothing 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.940
 what inspires you for the costumes 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.970
 of animation and come practically 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.940
 spontaneous on the moment like when I play 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.400
 that is I am not that I do one 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.070
 home ladder you understood so obvious 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.960
 that anyway I have to study thinking that 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.550
 I want her to see so so I want 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.630

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.150
 the same as the other I want the same 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.730
 hair wants themselves is the same too 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.459
 when I play then I go there 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.470
 I look at the track I watch people start 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.140
 to play my first 34 disks and then 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:29.440
 I understand therefore I go and of the same thing 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.070
 to dress well and what hat 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.070
 that other for everything 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.410

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.190
