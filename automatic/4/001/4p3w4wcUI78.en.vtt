00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.380 

we've<00:00:05.220> done<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> bunch<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.790> research<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.330> at

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
we've done a bunch of research here at

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.820 
we've done a bunch of research here at
the<00:00:06.480> University<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:06.960> Rochester<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> past

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the University of Rochester in the past

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.129 
the University of Rochester in the past
looking<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.670> men<00:00:08.940> perceive<00:00:09.450> women<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.960> red

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
looking at how men perceive women in red

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.560 
looking at how men perceive women in red
and<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:11.160> found<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.610> men<00:00:11.820> perceive<00:00:12.179> women<00:00:12.480> in

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and we found that men perceive women in

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.020 
and we found that men perceive women in
red<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:12.929> particularly<00:00:13.620> attractive<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
red as particularly attractive and the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.700 
red as particularly attractive and the
reason<00:00:15.299> why<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.570> find<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:15.990> attractive<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
reason why they find them attractive is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560 
reason why they find them attractive is
because<00:00:17.010> they<00:00:17.130> perceive<00:00:17.520> them<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:17.760> sexually

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
because they perceive them as sexually

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.260 
because they perceive them as sexually
available<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:19.529> sexually<00:00:20.010> interested<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:21.180> we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
available or sexually interested so we

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.759 
available or sexually interested so we
wanted<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> take<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.990> line<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> research<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
wanted to take this line of research a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
wanted to take this line of research a
step<00:00:22.949> further<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.550> how<00:00:23.670> women<00:00:24.060> perceive

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
step further and see how women perceive

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.779 
step further and see how women perceive
other<00:00:24.720> women<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.050> red<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.039> our<00:00:26.160> experiments

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
other women in red so in our experiments

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.450 
other women in red so in our experiments
we<00:00:27.000> showed<00:00:27.510> women<00:00:28.099> photographs<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.310> other

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
we showed women photographs of other

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.089 
we showed women photographs of other
women<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.080> we<00:00:31.080> had<00:00:31.320> manipulated<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
women and we had manipulated the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
women and we had manipulated the
clothing<00:00:32.550> color<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.570> women<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.989> those

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
identical the only thing that was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
identical the only thing that was
different<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> color<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.450> asked

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
different was the color and we asked

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
different was the color and we asked
women<00:00:40.010> various<00:00:41.010> questions<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.670> them<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
as much more sexually interested and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.619 
as much more sexually interested and
available<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.539> found<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.109> women<00:00:58.559> were

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
available we also found that women were

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
available we also found that women were
likely<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> insult<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:01.890> women<00:01:02.070> when

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

likely to insult these other women when
wearing<00:01:02.609> red<00:01:03.080> specifically<00:01:04.129> topics

wearing red specifically topics

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
wearing red specifically topics
regarding<00:01:05.580> their<00:01:05.729> sexual<00:01:06.180> fidelity<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.750> they

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
regarding their sexual fidelity so they

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
regarding their sexual fidelity so they
were<00:01:07.080> likely<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> say<00:01:07.970> for<00:01:08.970> example<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
were likely to say for example this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
were likely to say for example this
woman<00:01:09.930> probably<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.650> stay<00:01:10.950> loyal<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
woman probably can't stay loyal to just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
woman probably can't stay loyal to just
one<00:01:11.850> man<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> time

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
one man at a time

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.399 
one man at a time
she<00:01:13.590> probably<00:01:13.770> cheats<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> men<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.840> very

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
she probably cheats on men and then very

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 
she probably cheats on men and then very
interestingly<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:17.070> recruited<00:01:17.909> women<00:01:18.180> who

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
interestingly we recruited women who

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
interestingly we recruited women who
were<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.659> committed<00:01:19.439> romantic<00:01:19.890> relationships

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
were in committed romantic relationships

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
were in committed romantic relationships
and<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.729> asked<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.210> how<00:01:21.540> likely<00:01:22.470> they'd<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and we asked them how likely they'd be

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
and we asked them how likely they'd be
to<00:01:23.220> introduce<00:01:23.460> their<00:01:23.820> partner<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> woman<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to introduce their partner to a woman in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
to introduce their partner to a woman in
red<00:01:25.650> versus<00:01:26.070> green<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.549> likely<00:01:26.759> they'd<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
red versus green how likely they'd be to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
red versus green how likely they'd be to
spend<00:01:27.840> let<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.350> partner<00:01:28.590> spend<00:01:28.829> time<00:01:28.979> alone

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
spend let their partner spend time alone

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.910 
spend let their partner spend time alone
with<00:01:29.400> her<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.729> find<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.869> women<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.829> much

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
with her and we find that women are much

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490 
with her and we find that women are much
less<00:01:32.280> likely<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.600> their<00:01:33.930> man<00:01:34.110> anywhere

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
less likely to have their man anywhere

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530 
less likely to have their man anywhere
near<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> woman<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.310> red<00:01:35.460> essentially<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.360> big

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
near a woman in red essentially the big

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510 
near a woman in red essentially the big
picture<00:01:36.840> takeaway<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> color<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.310> much

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
picture takeaway is that color is much

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
picture takeaway is that color is much
more<00:01:38.729> than<00:01:38.909> meets<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> eye<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
more than meets the eye and this is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.630 
more than meets the eye and this is
something<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.920> take<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.280> granted<00:01:41.310> all

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
something that we take for granted all

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.039 
something that we take for granted all
the<00:01:41.700> time<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.420> through<00:01:42.659> life<00:01:42.810> thinking

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the time so we go through life thinking

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600 
the time so we go through life thinking
that<00:01:43.229> colors<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.280> our<00:01:44.399> visual

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that colors just here for our visual

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.179 
that colors just here for our visual
pleasure<00:01:45.079> but<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.380> color<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.799> convey

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pleasure but really color can convey

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.200 
pleasure but really color can convey
information<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.149> people<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:50.030> regardless<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
information to people that regardless of
