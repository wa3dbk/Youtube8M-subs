 a russian technology does not work 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.860
 Dortmund comes from the Internet because the history of aviation are used 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.190
 among the found drawings and photographs of German airports 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.190
 is especially the series Pauli 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.640
 you believe the documents 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.099
 use an alternative source of energy 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.619
 in so-called converter 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 no conventional fuels needed 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 they supposedly even thought about it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 With the house lived three this cost the space too 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.560
 however, captured by the Allies German archives 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.120
 was after the war 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.290
 another mysterious dead 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 it shows that she gave him a huge 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.980
 139 meters long cigar-shaped Steffens called a problem 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.690
 is 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.670
 the place for five euros rise 700 and 2 compete 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 the motherships long-term trust 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550
 there is another 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.410
 much easier explanation APA Euro the drawing shows a submerged 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.650
 Container for the transport of equipment and technology in addition 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.870
 agreed to the third empire including Antarctica 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.680
 according to reports of the American secret services 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 we sat the German at the end of the war new production in which flight 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 Write tested and built 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.170
 Oh of these farms is among scientists 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.080
 were successfully corrected from Germany again 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.890
 only one you are to be played before the arrival of the Allies 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.830
 meant is the VEM and Spohn reinforced of the American 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.200
 Intelligence »we have information for official use 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.940
 According to this, some of these advance operations after new car land in the Antarctic 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.720
 were pursued 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.910
 there was also at least one plant for the production of scarce 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.980
 two percent 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.450
 another to the Amazon region and a third to the north coast 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.979
 Norway 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.049
 all farms were taken to secret underground bunkers 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.119
 for the realization of the original plans 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.589
 the Tate in the Third Reich quite on him clearly the time 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.300
 after everything we know 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.800
 the critters were grandma Fischer aircraft until the end of the war 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 not manufactured in industrial manufacturing 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.599
 SID can not have been so 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.370
 in 1947 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.669
 becomes the Bruins Fleet Association under Admiral 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.790
 in the Antarctic attacks 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.749
 and fled 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.799
 you can attack the attacker 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.239
 after every second development divide that flight 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.500
 constructed in the third empire in parallel with the technological projects 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.679
 been 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.320
 the finished test objects 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.979
 we sat extraordinary ability 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 and documented the enormous lead of the Germans in the field 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.589
 technology 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.769
 Germany's opponents do not even suffer such a flight damage 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.319
 occupy rudimentary 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.109
 nevertheless, the existing ticket was not quite that the leaders of the 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.559
 Empire finals built models could only fly in the air and if 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:29.289
 I move today's hovercraft vehicles on solid ground, I think 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:35.439
 the fpö their advantage compared to ordinary aircraft was in it 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.719
 that they did not spin and since I was to steer they owned but 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.059
 a low quality 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.599
 and why not for your own right and high speeds 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.339
 left the prototype one of the most advanced models - so that 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.539
 Costs and 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.309
 made his first and last test flight 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:00.499
 at 19 in February 1945 near Prague 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.349
 according to eyewitness reports 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.520
 The pilot achieved lots of discus 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.749
 which was powered by a diagram of the engines 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.570
 within three minutes 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.049
 a height of 15 kilometers 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.249
 and a horizontal speed of 2200 kilometers per hour 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.669
 he could float in the air and fly forwards and backwards without turning 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.210
 a first 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.059
 groundbreaking he follows 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:32.199
 at that time the criticism was already on the German authorities 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.509
 In the face of imminent defeat, the National Socialists directed the 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.879
 do not break farms 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.529
 existing prototypes 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.849
 and the only copy Testpilot to discos 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.090
 he invents the main engine won show mine 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.050
 remembered later 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.289
 the model tested in February 1945 was in collaboration with engineers 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.960
 and specialists were the inmates of the concentration camp Mauthausen 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.039
 developed 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.039
 it was later blown up on police officers 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.870
 Pictures on which there is a discourse about the Antarctic 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870
 that's just the fantasy of the market 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.449
 many other drawings and photographs are of no significance 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.849
 the models shown are usually flightless constructs 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.450
 that were presented 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.450
 to be awarded further financial resources 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.320
 Airfield the production models 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.320
 did not exist in the third Reich 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.439
 Nevertheless 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.549
 were the successes of German scientists and engineers 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.529
 made 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.740
 compared to the Allies Pisa, the third empire is actually one 

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:51.159
 immense advantage in almost all scientific and technical 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.339
 areas 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.929
 a head start because many on the connection of scientific 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:59.399
 Insights with blur old are traceable back secret knowledge 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.270
 a connection 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.939
 not dangerous in the eyes of certain occult circles 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.349
 and the deeper reason for the catastrophic military 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.680
 Know the collapse of the Third Reich 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.400
 they do not only see the canal as a symbol of Altena 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.400
 but also as a moral authority 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.360
 because the National Socialists know the moral guidelines of the channel 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.360
 they did not know yet 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.979
 as it may be 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.340
 the representations and conjectures 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.839
 about the black boxes of the Third Reich 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.069
 for the meanwhile whole books 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.550
 what is truth 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.550
 what is genuine 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.069
 these would 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.349
 Sparks have emerged from the water since the 14 we have 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.099
 can 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.629
 Also today there are always messages 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:57.330
 lung or unknown flying objects as from the depths of the oceans constructions i 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.020
 But I am sure that neither the German nor any other nation in 1970 

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:07.349
 Year of the Angelus on the American act Lotte to such a technique 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:08.439
 decreed 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.360
 if the plates dressing was not seized by an earthly national 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.009
 then the question arises 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:20.180
 who had the power and the weapons and the Americans from the Beijing in to Ali 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.219
 chase away 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:25.219
 r 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:31.360
 since the 30's the flying saucers emerge 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.479
 Bird or cigar-shaped flying objects 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.560
 they are not detectable only for the polar regions 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.529
 1957 Norway 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:42.940
 2003 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.129
 this country attracts America 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:50.409
 on 16 January 1958 in Brazil Australia 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:53.689
 1963 South Africa 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.069
 everywhere you can find the unknown flies can be explained 

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:59.960
 teach the sightings 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.520
 which also includes the military intelligence service of the UTSG Sarah 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.159
 very nice
