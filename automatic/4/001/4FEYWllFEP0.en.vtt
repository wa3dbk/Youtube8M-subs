00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940
 But if you really want to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.780
 I will tell you 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.490
 I'm going to go to the army of society to catch it anyway. 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:19.330
 There is no floor. 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.460
 I do not know what to say to my wife right now . 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.810
 How can I not do others 3.25 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:31.119
 I went to work the boots now and there was a mountain point . 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:37.090
 When I get 15 calls, I get a phone call. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:40.090
 For picking up the phone, so I really wanted to 15 points when training 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.260
 I did not see the poem when I saw it. 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.370
 I get a cry when talking on the phone 9 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.609
 Oh, I do not know. 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.489
 Later on, now the presentation is much less down. 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:59.650
 But now the factory seems to be nicknamed 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:03.820
 I've seen her. 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.290
 It is so professional that it is a little ah 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.180
 Support was polychromatic If a person is not much closer to a two-year life 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.120
 singly 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.720
 I think the thing that seems to wait 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.490
 If it's about so that the hair turns you jindago 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.329
 I've asked a global, then why wait to hear 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.170
 Oh, I really hurt that enthusiasm. 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.360
 I told you it's not going to be a person when I'm tired. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.360
 Ah 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 Ah 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:42.360
 What seems to be defending this man is not wrinkled Vegas 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.890
 So the moment I put it himself called the juneunde accepted that clearance 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 Is not it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.930
 50 It's hard to do this, but the moment you set it apart is different 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.320
 Maybe it's like a ring. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.300
 A guy like me actually gets better here. You guys can end up. 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 Maybe there is such a good positive part waiting for winter 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.370
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 Ah
