00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.630
 unique electorate product right 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.330
 simulator swing machine 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 This is a device that allows you to work with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.580
 spinal column allows 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580
 to use him 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 medical centers and he is also very 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.820
 good for home 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.420
 of use 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 very often we hear our questions 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.199
 customers and buyers who are not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.340
 understand the principle of operation of the simulator for 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.740
 what is needed 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.660
 creation here is such a laurels massage and 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.989
 what generally to base works here and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.580
 our difference swing machine from many 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.240
 other 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.530
 massage oil massage 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.430
 the instrument is that it is not 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.750
 doing massage he works on 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.040
 central axis about structure it works 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.740
 on the spinal column 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.910
 we know that the spine consists 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.120
 of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs so 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.240
 here's an electronic simulator creates a wave 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.330
 offset ie vertebral encryption 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.940
 pillar is greater than pillar and one vertebra by 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.130
 relative to the other is shifted to the side 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.090
 directions on of course on very 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.030
 small amount 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.290
 when this occurs stretching 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.850
 one type of fibrous fiber data 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.500
 rings 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.360
 Segmental massage occurs this place 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.270
 output just the roots and intervertebral 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.550
 venous drainage occurs 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 blood swelling occurs 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.770
 if present, removal occurs 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 muscle tone short tonic 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.920
 muscles which are called 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.810
 paravertebral ie confusing 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.259
 spine 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.259
 how does the work on this simulator 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.869
 the patient may lie on the floor 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.630
 can lie on the massage table on any 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.180
 horizontal solid surface zone 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 ankle joints 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.930
 or Achilles tendons fit 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.120
 special carriage 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.859
 it is soft enough to have a surface 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.250
 comfortable enough for the location 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:29.590
 stop convenient remote control allows 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.840
 the patient either regulate the work himself 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.349
 simulator start the program include 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.139
 speed 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.989
 or to the operator from the outside to set 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:40.030
 necessary program 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.650
 work time of course began must 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.689
 be very small meaning we start 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 with short duration literally 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.849
 two or three minutes and then we bring 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.760
 gradually every day to 15 minutes 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.620
 this is quite enough management 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.169
 Enough space for now including 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.700
 automatic program pressed a button 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:03.519
 and in the morning I clicked on the button and we 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.169
 see work begins all enough 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.579
 just one side 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:14.069
 but the wave which now involves 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.419
 patient process is initially monitored 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.400
 logical 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.620
 musculature which the person himself can 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 control your head but through 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.449
 some time muscle control 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.449
 turn it off with the tone of the crowned logo 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.370
 and work begins on the vertebral 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.659
 a pillar 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.949
 this spike is the offset between the vertebrae 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.040
 massages intervertebral discs and 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.739
 unloads them from that axial load 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.199
 which occurs during a 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.479
 the load is not on squeezing 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.280
 sat on the path late core of the vertebrae 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:53.879
 and the disk that is the remote is late and the core and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.879
 loses sags and starts you thump 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.050
 in different directions heavier 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.440
 arm when muscle tone holds 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.240
 long occurs protrusion of the disc and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.460
 cynologist is up here 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.050
 formation of a herniated disc 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.030
 in order to avoid this this 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.890
 this is damage to degenerative 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.019
 interstitial disc changes we 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940
 recommend almost any adult 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.760
 man to use daily 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.830
 swing machine is definitely desirable 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.380
 consult a doctor because 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.620
 at the time of using this simulator 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.780
 there may already be contraindications for it 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.470
 use for example acute pain 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.400
 syndrome 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.590
 during the intervertebral hernia provocation 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.890
 when my sharp came when 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.930
 acute inflammation and swelling occurs 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.910
 the simulator can not use it 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.520
 understand this mistake is because 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.560
 that a person gets pain 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.030
 starts looking frantically what does he 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.710
 use how to remove his pain 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.240
 syndrome 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.080
 starting to use sing machine in this 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.950
 period can 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.180
 situation attire a little for myself and not 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.070
 get the desired effect 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.520
 therefore the simulator should be used for 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.070
 prophylaxis and under acute or go already 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.050
 remission process associated with 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.260
 degenerative apologies possible 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.020
 perform daily swing use 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.020
 machine allows you to bring vertebrate 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.690
 pillar order unload muscle tone 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.430
 paravertebral improve segmental 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.770
 internalization of the internal organs that is 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.630
 the state is really changing 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.350
 functioning of internal organs 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.220
 gastrointestinal tract organs of the thoracic 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.700
 cells and so on, and generally the whole 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.520
 of course this is a change in total 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.879
 self change 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:47.410
 mood and overall recovery of everything 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:48.400
 organism to move for emphasis 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.620
 the waves are now as we see 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.930
 maximum wave offset occurs 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.210
 lumbar one to 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.169
 a little wave 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.360
 translate above we can ask 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:05.340
 patient handles to take the breeder by the head 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.050
 like that and we already have a wave of shift 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.509
 a wave of this golden movement 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.819
 fish as it is called still goes higher 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:18.389
 can also draw a patent pull out 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.389
 hands even more and then practically already 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.500
 to the head end this way to the neck 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.539
 one of we see a small movement even 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.580
 head arises it says that 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:35.650
 Wave 6 tion of this wave here 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.000
 the impact comes passes around 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.539
 the vertebral side is pleasant enough 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.550
 procedure 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:45.520
 no pain arises 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.020
 due to raise 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.560
 hydrophilicity that is sate 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.560
 pulpal nucleus 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.430
 fluid is recommended before the session and 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:59.659
 after him to use clean spring 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.560
 water quantity there is 200 milliliters here 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:04.490
 all that is required 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.560
 and time of use is desirable 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.689
 the use of this device is 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.520
 in the evening that is, during the day we 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:12.409
 are on our feet 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.569
 vertical gravitational load 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:17.569
 pulp nuclei a little bit here 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:20.659
 sit down and you know what morning man 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.639
 each person after the price is higher and longer 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:26.360
 than in the evening it becomes like this 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:28.759
 these pressures you paznyx I Tengiz on 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.310
 locking discs and use this 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:34.009
 simulator daily then such a problem 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.129
 can very quickly remove and our disks 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.379
 will be very long no healthy 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:41.790
 pain does not allow to deliver 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:46.440
 save to harm 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.440
 possible ordinary
