fine that's a perfectly fine it's just

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.150 
fine that's a perfectly fine it's just
for<00:03:32.810> people<00:03:33.049> who<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.260> aren't<00:03:33.650> seeing<00:03:33.859> weight

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
for people who like aren't seeing weight

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.530 
for people who like aren't seeing weight
loss<00:03:34.400> results<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.060> maybe<00:03:35.450> why

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
loss results and this is maybe why

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.170 
loss results and this is maybe why
reason<00:03:36.079> number<00:03:36.230> three<00:03:36.890> 3<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.120> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
reason number three 3 is that you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.220 
reason number three 3 is that you
weren't<00:03:38.329> that<00:03:38.720> was<00:03:38.870> weird

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
drinking water you're retaining water

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.770 
drinking water you're retaining water
because<00:03:57.799> you're<00:03:57.920> dehydrated<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:59.540> ain't

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
because you're dehydrated and that ain't

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.309 
because you're dehydrated and that ain't
good<00:04:00.049> that's<00:04:00.350> gonna<00:04:00.530> cause<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.910> know

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
good that's gonna cause you to you know

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.930 
good that's gonna cause you to you know
even<00:04:03.319> just<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.890> bigger<00:04:04.130> just<00:04:04.519> gallons

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
even just like look bigger just gallons

even just like look bigger just gallons
of<00:04:05.060> water<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.600> yeah<00:04:06.200> reason<00:04:06.950> number<00:04:07.069> four<00:04:07.549> is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
of water so yeah reason number four is

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.250 
of water so yeah reason number four is
that<00:04:07.940> you're<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.329> mindful<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.989> what<00:04:09.139> you're
