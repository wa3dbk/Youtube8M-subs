00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 Hi, people, I'm going to decorate today. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.540
 a glass cup 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.200
 so I 'll use a glass of cottage cheese 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.950
 I'm going to use a little glass of water and I'm going to use it. 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.420
 enamel and to make the decoration cakes is 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.330
 just a little bit 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.610
 I'll get the yellow enamel then 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.020
 I'll start with the yellow I'm going to throw. 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.160
 two droplets in it in the water 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 I'm going to put one more 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.530
 I'm going to do this to others 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.340
 I'm going to go to the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.340
 an orange 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:55.150
 I'm going to put three drops of each and now 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.150
 I'll switch to darker orange 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 Then I'll repeat the sequence. 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.470
 you do not have to have a certain number of 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.460
 sequences you can do as many as you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.650
 want to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.500
 then you come with a toothpick and 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 remove the nail enamel same to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 make the drawing here inside the enamel 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.910
 so just pick up and pull but whenever 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 was pulling clean or picking a wipe 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.450
 just pull 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.280
 after you did the drawing 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.119
 you come with a glass and put the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.610
 first-rate glass and then 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 dive it into the dive so direct 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 not 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.790
 Ready for the drawing he'll be all over 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.050
 here in the bottom of the glass and now it's just 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.410
 expect to dry 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.590
 so people went that way the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.070
 drawing on the background I made two more too 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.490
 one with the same colors and another in shades 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.230
 the enamel is very strong then 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.250
 You can leave him like this. 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 that is 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.600
 or if you want to reinforce you can 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.570
 two layers of general varnish here in 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.840
 only in the part of the drawing for 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:08.450
 reinforce even more so you do not leave on time 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:12.770
 washing machine is a simple idea and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.510
 easy to do because many times the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.120
 people even throw away the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.330
 curd and if we put together several 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.000
 to make a collection that looks beautiful 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.810
 You can make all the colorful one of 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.270
 each color 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.540
 or else you can do all the same 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.400
 the same enamel colors as 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 the drawings do not identify themselves 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.560
 different from each other and I 've seen 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.560
 this style of glass selling in stores 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.230
 decor and they are super carlos and 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.690
 Can people continue to have July and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.030
 cup of curd that gets super cool 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.370
 I hope you liked the idea. 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.650

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.620

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.620
