Sainsbury's the other night and this is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979

why the checkout reduced to two pounds

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
why the checkout reduced to two pounds
and<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.460> should<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.850> been<00:00:48.059> depending<00:00:48.780> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
today they get $7.99 so I thought two

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
today they get $7.99 so I thought two
pounds<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.910> worth<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.660> worth<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:55.050> pounds

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
