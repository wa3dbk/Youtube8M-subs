00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
in GTA v now rumor has it the adder is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.930 
in GTA v now rumor has it the adder is
the<00:00:12.840> fastest<00:00:13.380> car<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> game<00:00:14.009> aka<00:00:14.610> the

Bugatti and then there's other people
who<00:00:17.670> say<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> coil<00:00:18.510> aka<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.439> Tesla<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.010> faster

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
who say the coil aka the Tesla is faster

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.080 
who say the coil aka the Tesla is faster
so<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:21.689> gonna<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.320> drag<00:00:22.890> race<00:00:23.160> first<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
so I'm gonna do that drag race first and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.890 
so I'm gonna do that drag race first and
get<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> way<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.800> anyways<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
get that out the way but anyways I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
get that out the way but anyways I
picked<00:00:27.900> four<00:00:28.289> legendary<00:00:29.189> sports<00:00:29.550> cars<00:00:29.910> soup

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
picked four legendary sports cars soup

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.190 
picked four legendary sports cars soup
them<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.260> engine<00:00:31.769> suspension<00:00:32.099> tires

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200

brakes all of it so the first two up is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.690 
brakes all of it so the first two up is
gonna<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> adder<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.809> left<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
gonna be the adder on the left and the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
gonna be the adder on the left and the
coil<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> stats<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
coil on the right now the stats on the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
coil on the right now the stats on the
adder<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:45.840> 8<00:00:45.989> liter<00:00:46.289> engine

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

the runway

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
the runway
I<00:01:19.740> picked<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.909> long<00:01:21.180> track<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I picked a pretty long track so you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
I picked a pretty long track so you
could<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> cars<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:24.270> speed<00:01:24.630> and

could get the cars up to top speed and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
could get the cars up to top speed and
see<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.520> let's<00:01:26.790> get

all<00:02:08.840> right<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.700> adder<00:02:10.940> takes<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
all right so the the adder takes the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.800 
all right so the the adder takes the
first<00:02:11.900> drag<00:02:12.230> race<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.910> far<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.300> rumors<00:02:14.660> are

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
first drag race so far the rumors are

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.770 
first drag race so far the rumors are
correct<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.560> faster<00:02:16.040> than<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> coil<00:02:16.780> now

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
correct it's faster than the coil now

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.770 
correct it's faster than the coil now
these<00:02:17.959> are<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.200> two<00:02:18.500> underdogs<00:02:19.160> up<00:02:19.580> next<00:02:20.330> we

pretty<00:03:58.200> easily<00:03:59.120> so<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.269> wins<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.780> chance<00:04:01.079> to

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
pretty easily so it wins a chance to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120

I'll be damned the entity XF it's a

see<00:05:18.069> it<00:05:18.520> beat<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.479> adder<00:05:19.689> so<00:05:21.210> I'm<00:05:22.210> guessing

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870

well<00:05:23.259> I'm<00:05:23.379> I'm<00:05:23.740> I'm<00:05:24.279> gonna<00:05:24.430> go<00:05:24.520> ahead<00:05:24.879> and<00:05:25.150> say

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
well I'm I'm I'm gonna go ahead and say

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.019 
well I'm I'm I'm gonna go ahead and say
that<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.810> entity<00:05:26.259> XF<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.249> fastest<00:05:27.759> car<00:05:27.789> in

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
GTA and this proves otherwise so let me

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.899 
GTA and this proves otherwise so let me
know<00:05:32.139> put<00:05:32.439> some<00:05:32.620> cars<00:05:32.889> in<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.249> description
