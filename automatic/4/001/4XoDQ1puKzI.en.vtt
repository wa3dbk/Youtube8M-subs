00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
work than that one yeah that was my

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.210 
work than that one yeah that was my
eighth<00:04:09.569> ninth<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.380> think<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.739> was<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.889> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
eighth ninth one I think that was a the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.370 
eighth ninth one I think that was a the
toughest<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.579> as<00:04:11.880> well<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.060> think<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.480> far<00:04:12.510> it's

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
toughest one as well I think so far it's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.379 
toughest one as well I think so far it's
going<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.650> believe<00:04:13.799> it<00:04:13.859> like<00:04:14.220> first<00:04:14.970> lap<00:04:15.269> we

kept on making up places here and there
and<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.400> putt<00:04:26.610> could<00:04:26.820> still<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.210> Cameron<00:04:27.660> in

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780
