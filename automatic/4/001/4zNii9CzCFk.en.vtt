00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 suwe accounts to rooms new video from 9 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.640
 that today at one 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.239
 like the jurors 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:09.419
 about a little one 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.610
 iPhone app what is currently free is called Altheim 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.400
 or it is and remains 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 Leps 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.890
 the link to that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.019
 program 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.900
 Halftime APA happig 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.569
 in the comments post 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.459
 With the small program you can stop at certain time intervals 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.859
 Take pictures 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.859
 this disadvantage if a subtitle as a movie 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.810
 always through the program 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.150
 Of course, first of all, you need a project 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.350
 where to store his pictures Trump 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.560
 da Collection on the first project page 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.420
 choose to entertain 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.790
 Spec States would like to or maybe just change the project again 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.430
 want 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 or would like to upload 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.850
 or whatever 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 in the now purely new project 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.259
 there we have 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.689
 the ability to make the settings once, of course 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
 in which intervals should be triggered 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 there are the possibilities to let the stalemate once so all five 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.020
 Seconds or every hour or every minute red as you like 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.260
 Welcome to the People WHO also manually press what we do for one 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.310
 little bit unhappy 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 and whatever else is possible you can Rheine 2 and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.370
 Spelle 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.240
 set if speak 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.370
 Gelis alcohol level is reached then is triggered 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 as a kind of surveillance camera 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.360
 the recording conditions 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 You can now say again either start manually 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.380
 or he should start in three minutes or three hours or you can even 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.910
 say 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.670
 on the deem and the date and the time Straten a bit with it 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.539
 under Stoiber shots 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.759
 Again there are the three possibilities to say after 3000 photos 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.469
 but let's go 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.920
 or after Liu 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.579
 20 minutes 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.500
 Lord thank you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.879
 or even no attention 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.289
 on that date to make this time bitter on recordings 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.629
 Under screen resolution you now have the opportunity to enter in the meantime 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.959
 quite plainly plague 120 times 160 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.649
 Thousands of 600 flowed up to thousands at that time 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.209
 tackle to 3 or 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.030
 a thousand 536 times in 2008 was contained in the 3gs 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.709
 So we already have players on 9 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.849
 then we have the next step after we can do ours 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.150
 Timelapse started and our pictures have been taken 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.559
 then comes 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.739
 that still change 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.939
 and at the race come now also different things set 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.400
 Of course, how many frames per second should be displayed 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.389
 Percent you can give it 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.019
 allocate the plans for the video 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.549
 you can also forgive the old video resolution again that's the same 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.829
 as in 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.109
 the recordings speak again of only 20 gastric band 60 bistros 1 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:42.669
 Bohnert 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.359
 Waldhausen 600 at the 3g 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.730
 and up to a thousand five times 36 times 2048 palms 3g s 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.739
 but what a hot one you can music 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.349
 thus Inter lie 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.159
 Percent the 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.400
 Here are some who said they are available from the bus 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.559
 and then still lying bit to provide background with rolls 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.620
 Timestamps could of course be added again as well 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.829
 so maybe that is quite handy if you are so keen on that and 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.739
 So say if a certain cowboy game reaches Peter Marte times 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.539
 photo 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.870
 and for the first one you can do that too 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.349
 Logo of this program in his video with ads but leave something 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.349
 I also exhibited with me 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.639
 and what you have remembered we come 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.389
 I finished this view two more pieces 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.419
 in two different resolutions 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.250
 and the recordings I made there are about 17 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.219
 Minutes had been crushed few 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.639
 they have already broken once to 26 seconds at 8 photos per second 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.539
 around 35 victory around 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.520
 Customers 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.909
 Brandon want 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.559
 six frames per second 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.020
 and in different resolutions 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.509
 Of course you have the opportunity 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.520
 Percent of his videos to share what's too stupid 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.490
 I've tried that against the Taliban 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.539
 I do not know Facebook, I like to book 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.819
 Percent like Mio 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.960
 Halmich uploaded and is still standing because this video with 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.509
 uploaded 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.960
 although I had taken much more watch first 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.819
 GEA complete from an emergency I think you get a clipboard 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.120
 copied 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.430
 automatically but in how does the video then not 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.620
 and uploaded to YouTube and 4 immediately 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.809
 available 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.169
 Santner after iPhone recording I have not arrived because of the 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.019
 always told me or could dissolve was too big I can not in yours 

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.639
 Export iPhone recordings 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.639
 and by e-mail 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.910
 does not work either 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.910
 Grazing the files are relatively large 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.460
 just 42 by taking the Founder Seconds shot for example 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.930
 and yet only up to 10 MB 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.080
 for chicken 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.969
 as I already said before 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.110
 like done, so you can see that I'm not 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.479
 really follow 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.099
 and as you can see 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.859
 I'm still curious about the marriage Hameln Kar Stechen Saur 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.369
 and as I said that was nice so only four seats minutes and eight hours 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:38.199
 in the original shows 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.630
 that's all open now 30 seconds interrupted 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.659
 and as you can see 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.039
 it was actually quite out of tune it was not the optimal one 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.559
 Recording quality Norway yes today Groth times clouds before so therefore 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.029
 it is always light and dark 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.379
 Zagreb are available for selection 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.759
 the 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.819
 a second point is as often in time for free on the web is in 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.319
 the descriptions tunnel 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.680
 and that I too 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.360
 I would like to take a look at the opportunity right now 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.530
 and it also makes a lot of fun to see what you can do with them 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.089
 can record 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:19.839
 until next video 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.179
 Have a nice day
