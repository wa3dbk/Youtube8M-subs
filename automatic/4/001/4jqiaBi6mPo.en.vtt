00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.050
 so today I'm on the 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.210
 in front of the renault workshop which tends 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.490
 arms 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 you expose the renault space and in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.470
 does more than it goes anymore this car 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.730
 interests me 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.380
 Clairmarais pass when I was a kid 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.599
 when the r25 was out I was coming on 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.259
 the fields because I'm ivory and well 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.059
 be 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.059
 this space I find that 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.570
 see more about the game trucks state 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.879
 what's changing what these different stages a 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.030
 intelligent mix of as they the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.320
 say also about minivans and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 crossover but I find that it happens to 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 to be reassuring 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.820
 securing like all cars have 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.220
 need to be mauritius without having 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 the air of a tank of one of the ladies 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.699
 heart 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 it's even more true outside at 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.710
 inside by biting and that's right 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.830
 that we always criticize the French or 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 the houses but the other brands that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.259
 the Germans do not try things 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.299
 then when it's time we're not 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.670
 happy because they violate 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.130
 the canons the rules it is by the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890
 German but 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.899
 It has very interesting rest 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 interesting when we board you 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.010
 see 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.010
 shaw that emerges is bright there is 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:36.400
 this long long long long long 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:40.510
 console that is quite tight m he 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.640
 there is also 7:30 big big board of 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.070
 edge as in their camp as in 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.830
 capture 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.370
 see well then there the table there is no 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.870
 the ignition key but 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.190
 sailboats small details when one when 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.800
 is running for the wheelchair that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.260
 fits on the screen 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.159
 can we decide to save it 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.520
 it is well done 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.560
 I like the steering wheel also all that and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.019
 it changed nothing there is a sense of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.230
 freedom destiny crosses and that's really 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.230
 owl 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.760
 see when we open there go there 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 these three camp chairs 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 big chest 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.670
 me if I were an executive and I had 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.610
 choose a car and especially that it is 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.020
 that I will take 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.900
 yahia 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.680
 there is life in there 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.069
 mount the chairs 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.069
 appeared 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.000
 I think it's really the trunk 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 back and well 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.410
 which deserves to be held 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.410
 here 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.950
 not serious 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.300
 that's what I wanted to go to show 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.560
 in the world its little touches there we 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.709
 presses 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.850
 Arrivals and descents with treatment 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.070
 the seats 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.070
 obviously it does not go up alone 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.900
 it's nice 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.189
 here are the seven places 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.189
 it has to be good because there is 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.370
 there is consistency in the proposal 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.390
 here I was wondering if so 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.610
 if there are not many 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.140
 the mark ds but maybe that's 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.989
 renault who will find the equation with 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 I can already hear people screaming 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.400
 although their initials his forty 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.260
 thousand euros say that 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.630
 our range approach is super luxury 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.340
 but me it goes up a lot to these 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.160
 differences that must also be acknowledged 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.930
 they hold in the distance 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.270
 here they have been too late to change this 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.490
 space 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.290
 know the industrial reasons I 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.640
 saw that but there she is there 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.500
 they have to keep seeing on the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.190
 high-end version go there August 4 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.960
 headmistress 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.360
 I know it's not planned but I 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.530
 would still like them to do it 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.630
 which is a plug-in hybrid version 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.730
 which is maybe a 4WD 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.360
 it's not for now but in 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.830
 the next one must stay on course 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.400
 I like this set 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.949
 these are the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 led lights we have in it we want to 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.000
 travel aboard this car 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.390
