00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello to everyone as we are here 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.979
 bringing them another video more and kirk 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.160
 software choge mind is already getting 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.370
 closer to day to day we get closer 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.350
 at the time of his departure and for the same 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.210
 Well I software coach 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.310
 right now is doing the subject of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.520
 moment because they are taking out many 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.380
 things between which the game leaked 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.660
 how good they are already starting to upload 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.940
 the images of the skins of the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.360
 characters all of all that kind of 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.909
 things so want it do not be a little 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.920
 attractive not me too like that the 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.929
 know a little bit what to expect 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.690
 new that I 've seen the armor I think 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.449
 that something will be done to them 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.089
 interesting and good the same thing happens with 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.129
 any name game when it's going to 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.280
 leave then start to generate controversy 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.210
 interest of both for good and for bad 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.219
 but then we are all not 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.170
 and when gears of wars george comes out 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.570
 mind what will happen with the software 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.750
 3 and they're going to leave him they're not going to let him 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.550
 this is something quite interesting because 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.369
 good when a new game comes out that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.190
 it's being the continuation or at least 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.590
 the new game of the franchise so 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.350
 general the previous game for very good 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.729
 that this has been the people leave it and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.009
 I go and then it gives way to the following I 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.890
 when I started playing software I 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.229
 I hooked with 1 I felt it as one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.080
 of the best games that had what 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.960
 I enjoyed it a lot and I was very excited 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.090
 playing when the software arrived 2 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.970
 at the moment I'm a bit reluctant to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.789
 change because I'm honest I did not like it 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.009
 much at the beginning the way in which 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.340
 they changed the fight with the shotgun but 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.619
 it was just a matter of adapting myself and wii 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.110
 this and it was when I grabbed him 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.490
 honey not to wool be because good I 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.530
 per se 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.810
 of lying software one was never a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.450
 player that will stand out precisely for 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.100
 his skill with the shotgun news of war 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.259
 2 was when I decided to learn to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.380
 use it and well they started dating 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.690
 interesting situations that made me 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.300
 enjoy the game when it came just add 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 war 3 I was already happy with gears 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 of war 2 and I felt that it will be the game 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.170
 ideal, nothing more 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.590
 even I expected that nothing else go up and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.900
 it's a graphic change and a change of 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.170
 gameplay that did a little bit more 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 fast but in itself this to be played 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.530
 exactly the same, not even I had 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.410
 my doubts if I wanted to change let's say 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 until the gameplay itself did not and it said no 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.930
 I know I'm very comfortable with gears of war 2 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.549
 really I am more than happy what 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.799
 only one that I would like is that the one who 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.959
 solve the problem of the llosa was 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.489
 what I thought on the eve of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.640
 come out the gears of war 3 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.960
 when gears of war 3 came out at the beginning 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.810
 It also made me a little 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 I miss strange things that I liked 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.940
 there were things that not especially since the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.630
 change the power of weapons by 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.170
 example the normal lancer the camerbÃºs and 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 they did more damage was the retro throw 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.700
 with the super damage that was doing that was what 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.100
 harder I think to adapt 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.270
 many that good at the beginning of the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.760
 throw challenge was let's say the most used weapon 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.340
 and the one that more controversial started 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.410
 generate the same thing happened with the shotgun 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.020
 cut out that for many of us 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.440
 it was annoying because we did not have 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.530
 in a lot of notion of how to fit into that 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.900
 new style of total game at the end 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.260
 because software 3 ended up charming me 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.360
 I am already mated or used to gears 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.600
 of war 3 I love the game I enjoy it 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.780
 a lot and when it suddenly comes to me 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.890
 to put and software one I was made a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.160
 very heavy game a gameplay 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.530
 very bland the truth this edition hears lame 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.410
 who can sing that night because I 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.400
 loved because in his time it was what 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 I was and I enjoyed it a lot and already after 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.870
 I started playing gears of war 2 happened to me 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.590
 the same I did not like the gameplay 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.799
 of the gears of war 2 it made me soda 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.040
 it made very slow it made me that weapons 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.070
 now it did very little damage are the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.470
 changes so that you feel it is not 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.930
 what comes with what always comes 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.630
 now when will I come out software 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.970
 choge mind good is the game of the saga 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.980
 that more controversy has brought by 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.860
 various different changes 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.870
 situations then here the interesting thing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.580
 it's going to happen with the software the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.500
 george meant people migrate to 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.170
 completely to george men and they will leave 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.200
 gears of war 3 that that's what in 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.610
 general would be expected from a game 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.170
 when a new version of a 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.540
 franchise that's usually what you 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.910
 he hopes that some people do not 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.550
 abandon or reach new players 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.260
 that franchise that's regular proof that 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.960
 it is expected not but the players say 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.230
 more of heart are those that we say 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.000
 they abandon the game they enjoyed 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.550
 so much time and give you the opportunity to 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.980
 what's new with juventus 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.730
 you will migrate abandon to new 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.730
 software 3 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.530
 I feel that at least me since 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.530
 principle I will not leave and the 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.660
 3d software to see milestone I feel that 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.940
 it would be interesting not even if 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.640
 I'm uploading the video be Internet 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.140
 to be able to do this comparisons of the 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.870
 gameplay because when I feel that it's going to 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.270
 have an equally drastic change and 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.210
 I feel that the good can come 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.140
 at which time I was coupled by 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.030
 full 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.850
 the software choge men and I wonder 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.040
 Now, what will happen? 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.410
 moment when I feel like now 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.560
 I feel when I put gears of war 2 or the 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.130
 yourself or I'm sorry a game 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.100
 weights or a mobility that I do not like 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.620
 everything and everything is good because the 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.990
 change in the new game is the one that you 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.840
 impose another style and you get used to 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.630
 He is not what makes you like it 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.600
 both despite the fact that at the beginning 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.150
 then have doubts be reluctant not 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.520
 let's say let's go electric by 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.830
 complete to change I feel that that goes 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.590
 to happen that at the beginning it's going to cost me 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.810
 I work to adapt to the new techniques 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.090
 of george meant and in due time by 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.800
 that is going to be a game that 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.130
 I'm going to end up liking it better 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.919
 I hope that without the good subject you can see 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.979
 the controversy that has to endure already 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.680
 we will see and I will be able to judge completely if 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.690
 the game is bad or not when it comes out and 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.270
 after I try it for a while 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.140
 because then I can not and we're going to make a 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.440
 is a good judgment based on 12 this 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.830
 let's see 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.710
 based on one or two games that have to be 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.390
 be just fair because good before 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.970
 he said that software 1 was the best 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.160
 Now I say that he does not say that 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.890
 curse of war 2 was the best now 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.650
 I have come to say that gears of war 3 is 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.810
 the best and who knows if now after 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.850
 of a time change your mind in that 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.920
 aspect but good and I'm getting closer 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.260
 at the end of this video you who believe 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.140
 about that they will abandon stress 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.450
 complete will not be gradual 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.760
 flat do not want to try georg mind that 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.660
 is what they are going to do now that this 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.210
 good title comes your departure date 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:43.390
 it's something interesting we hope that the 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:46.090
 game is not as controversial as we expect 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.860
 and that we all fit together little by little 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:52.680
 thank you very much for having seen this 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.680
 video and see you on another occasion goodbye 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.080
 survive much more
