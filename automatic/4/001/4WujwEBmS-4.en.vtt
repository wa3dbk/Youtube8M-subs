00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.459
 hello to all Varese work friends 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.670
 internal video review of today vi 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.490
 we always present a device of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.550
 panasonic then a blu ray player 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.340
 smart cards also external hard drives 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.169
 we are talking about the dmp bdt300 20 a one 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.719
 smart network that you can use with 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.340
 any kind of TV 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:39.160
 the peculiarity is its remote control 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.190
 which has the touch part so to be 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 operated as a touchscreen as you see 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.249
 above in addition to the various features 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.499
 also the skype part so we can 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.739
 check at 360 degrees and connect it 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:56.920
 to the network to do everything 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.999
 so we want to go on the internet or to 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 example to give on facebook on skype su 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:10.530
 youtube so we can do many things 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.469
 also because it is an exploits the network is a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.000
 wifi so we can use the internet 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.899
 just like we do our own 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.350
 devices 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.899
 the particularity is compatible with 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.729
 own smart remote application 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.380
 of the panasonic that will allow us to 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.079
 example with an iphone 5 or a galaxy 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.049
 s3 a galaxy tab is the application is 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.130
 universal for both android devices 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.350
 that for the idevices that we can 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.140
 directly check all that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.250
 we want to do with our panasonic 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 dmp bdt300 beds so we could maybe 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.829
 play our movie in 3d 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.350
 or listen to music through 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.750
 internet go on skype on facebook on 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.270
 twitter to see for example a stream 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.460
 on stream or see our videos 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.460
 greetings analysis indirectly from 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.690
 this device is controlled 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.490
 directly from a device 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.070
 which an iphone or a galaxy but now 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.800
 let's see how it covers once 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.050
 configured our device 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.320
 of course we can hook it up with either 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.840
 an iphone that with an android device 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.920
 via the 2012 remote app 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.870
 as you see I am now using a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.290
 iphone 5 so I will use 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.240
 the official remote control application 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.430
 that you will find both on the app store and on 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.040
 google play store 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.240
 so once he identified the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.190
 our device 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.390
 we will not have to do anything other than capable 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.280
 above and use our device 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.470
 mobile as if it were a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.350
 TV remote 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:09.230
 so we can go up and down 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:14.030
 what concerns all the menus we can 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.100
 for example put into play our a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.980
 then our movie paused 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.980
 subsequently to stop it e 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.110
 of course we can as you see 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.489
 make slides directly on the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.540
 phone 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.010
 as for the whole 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.800
 of our device management 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.140
 so you will not need the remote control 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.050
 also its convenient because it has a 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.630
 touchscreen so we can move to 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:55.360
 right and left and manage all those 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:59.260
 which are the menus I found 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.209
 even more functional and that of the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.500
 controller the panasonic has 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.820
 done much more for all of us 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.610
 then inserted the original remote control 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.459
 we could also use wanting also 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.840
 this fantastic functionality besides 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.959
 all the work behind it 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.539
 whatever 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.360
 but of an app that naturally works 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.870
 with many of the panasonic devices that 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.180
 he thought well thought of doing it both for 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.780
 devices for android devices 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.360
 so this makes it an app 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 universal for all those who are i 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.789
 panzoni devices controlled by 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 mobile systems so we can use 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:49.500
 what as you see the touch 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.220
 touch touch because we have this 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.639
 fantastic remote we can 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.210
 use but of course these are 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.400
 just some of the features 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.630
 let's see for example the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.849
 display with a galaxy s3 well 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.560
 now we are with a galaxy s3 then 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.180
 we can carry out all those who are 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.380
 the operations we carried out 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.240
 even before and use the app 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.820
 just like we did with the iphone 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.830
 5 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:33.330
 so we could then return to ours 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.240
 main menu directly with the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:41.400
 our remote control to 2012 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.610
 the official panasonic application 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.870
 as you see the numeric keypad if 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.870
 we want to use it 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.560
 or return to the main menu 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.030
 I certainly find it more comfortable perhaps 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:06.240
 use given the size a galaxy 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.099
 s3 rather than an iphone 5 or maybe 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.520
 even better if sir and comfortable on the sofa 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:14.460
 with a galaxy tab 7 inches or otherwise 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.320
 a 7 inch device so we could 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.199
 even going on on the skype part is 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.300
 Internet 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:28.409
 so as you see I am gone now 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.330
 in the update part then for 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.080
 I can use reasoning 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.349
 both directional keys and 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.150
 then plug directly in updates 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.620
 Right now 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.539
 i will go to update what the 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.300
 device is all thanks 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:47.050
 to the smart remote application controls 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.110
 panasonic has therefore as you see yes 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.650
 is connecting the network we can also 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.639
 choose not to upgrade 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:07:01.780
 so all through slides then 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.150
 is a universal application for these 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.930
 types of devices there are many blue 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.389
 ray performing these operations with 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.270
 the application of smart remote then 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.129
 it doesn't matter that you have a 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.009
 panasonic television or not 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:22.629
 the application is dedicated as far as 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:25.770
 regards the readers of blu ray sd card e 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:29.560
 and I'll also show you later 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.460
 ipods to hear directly 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:42.879
 music from these fantastic devices 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:42.879
