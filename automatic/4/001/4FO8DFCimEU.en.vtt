00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello very good everyone I'm imp and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.630
 I'm a new video to tell you that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 there are other steps of stress worth it I already knew 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 I knew there was a step, it was the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 scalene triangle told me a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 boy of the play is worth a friend who 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 that's done with the fans and the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 lampposts okay you have to put it on 22 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 fans in two concrete words and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.570
 it tells you the well done player is worth and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.059
 well that makes the scalene triangle and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 then an orb will come out of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 tower of babel as long as you have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 the two straits and then you can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 introduce the nascar 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.500
 I knew that step but I did not upload it because 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 because I did not know what it was for, not me 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 I knew what the player said well done and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.940
 something else but I did not know what it was for and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 good today watching forums watching channels 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 guiris I have also seen a video of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.570
 poker I have seen that the absorbe leaves if not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.400
 I knew what the order was they absorb it not 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.400
 I know what four of the traffic lights 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.260
 and two more than I would go with the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.070
 triangle scalene and other 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.930
 and well I had seen it but not as 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.300
 I did not know what it was for and today reading and 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.730
 watching videos it is known that there 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.460
 Another step is worth it because he said that 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.860
 transit above the map is like a 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.310
 clock and the scalene triangle serves to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.980
 change the hours not supposedly and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.410
 he has also said that when he does the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.200
 scalene triangle can put the face 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.000
 let's mark what it is I still do not know if it's 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.410
 I'll really try to dance the triangle 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.080
 scalene that you're going to do it does not make 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.110
 time and see if I can make the step 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.870
 to this one and then we would have 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.620
 another step made to see what happens not 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.140
 star is getting a lot 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.360
 information has gotten in like the code 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.970
 Morse also gives Pelao he think is worth 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.340
 the star lot because if not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.320
 we had no fucking idea 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.290
 and good if you want 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.570
 the twitter of her uncle told me 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.360
 style I leave the description does not cost me 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.700
 nothing and good this video came up more than 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 nothing because before I said that a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.100
 video about the traffic lights not 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.959
 to see if anyone knew something and good 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.880
 already without investigating between suvs 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.280
 forums forums and such look we have 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.840
 found out this did not and well I liked it 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.340
 I liked that you knew it all and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.440
 soon the stress will come out 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 complete surely to see if you do not know 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 no newer step and we complete it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.790
 already a fucking time because I'm already up 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.950
 the eggs this stress and good if you have 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.420
 something newer you can tell me in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.890
 the comments also a kid has 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.830
 said when they have the four orbs 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.650
 put the turbines on top of the bus and 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.360
 comes out a fireball or a red ball or 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.670
 something like that and let us pass the bus no 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.880
 be nothing, I will also look at it, I will 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.260
 this is not good with you more information 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.470
 let's have all of them whenever it is 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.269
 true it's worth not to beat me 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 all here because if it's not losing the 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.180
 weather 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.819
 we will do it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.340
 and good when I get it done 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.140
 the brand I'll upload it's worth and good to give 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.670
 thanks because also for your video 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.069
 that helps me a lot to know why 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.959
 served the scalene triangle that I know 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.719
 I told him long ago that we 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.189
 We were taking a step but, well, not what 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:28.030
 I went up either because I did not know why 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.319
 what was good because it went up there were no and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.230
 well now I'll do it to see 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.209
 what is not and good to like to comment to 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.760
 see if you have any questions or have 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.160
 some to see if you know something new 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.930
 I remember that the recordings are in the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.550
 on the farm on television that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.550
 it will also be necessary after the triangle 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.800
 he turns on the lights to listen to them and 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.310
 Well, here I leave the video a greeting and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.310
 until next time
