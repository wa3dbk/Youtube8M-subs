about<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> spring<00:01:32.970> split<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.390> guys<00:01:33.420> never

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
about the spring split you guys never

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
about the spring split you guys never
really<00:01:34.650> found<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:35.100> groove<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> regular

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
really found your groove in the regular

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
really found your groove in the regular
season<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.200> seemed<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> well<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.920> best<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
season but seemed to do well in best of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
season but seemed to do well in best of
fives<00:01:38.700> talk<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> break<00:01:40.860> between

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
fives talk to me about the break between

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.249 
fives talk to me about the break between
spring<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.670> summer<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> how<00:01:43.049> you're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
spring and summer and how you're

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
spring and summer and how you're
planning<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> maybe<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.149> those

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
planning to maybe work on some of those

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
planning to maybe work on some of those
weaknesses<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.340> improved

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
weaknesses well so I think we improved

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
weaknesses well so I think we improved
our<00:01:47.790> early<00:01:48.119> game<00:01:48.299> you're<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.630> following<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
our early game you're not following that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.830 
our early game you're not following that
far<00:01:49.290> behind<00:01:49.409> anymore<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.180> playing

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
far behind anymore and we are playing

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
far behind anymore and we are playing
great<00:01:51.960> better<00:01:52.229> before<00:01:52.530> scaling<00:01:52.799> mid<00:01:53.040> laners

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
great better before scaling mid laners

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
great better before scaling mid laners
so<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.020> fall<00:01:55.200> too<00:01:55.380> far<00:01:55.530> behind<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so if you if you fall too far behind of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
so if you if you fall too far behind of
scaling<00:01:56.159> mid<00:01:56.250> laners<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> huge

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
scaling mid laners you have a huge

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
scaling mid laners you have a huge
problem<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> mid<00:01:57.930> game<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.979> most

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
problem in the mid game but I think most

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.490 
problem in the mid game but I think most
of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> times<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.119> Skrim<00:02:00.360> cellies<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.259> don't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of the times in Skrim cellies we don't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
of the times in Skrim cellies we don't
really<00:02:01.799> fall<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> hold<00:02:02.939> anymore<00:02:03.149> well

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
really fall into that hold anymore well

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.819 
really fall into that hold anymore well
we'll<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.350> only<00:02:04.500> week<00:02:04.680> why

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
we'll have to see it is only week why

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.200 
we'll have to see it is only week why
not<00:02:05.009> being<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.460> bit<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.969> damn

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
doubt you talked about scaling mid

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.440 
doubt you talked about scaling mid
laners<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.379> about<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.649> scaling<00:02:11.129> else

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
laners what about the scaling else

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.720 
laners what about the scaling else
yes<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.959> lot<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.230> people<00:02:12.349> say<00:02:12.620> summer<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.459> teams

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
yes a lot of people say summer the teams

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.220 
yes a lot of people say summer the teams
are<00:02:13.910> stronger<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> players<00:02:14.660> are<00:02:14.900> stronger

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
are stronger the players are stronger

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.930 
are stronger the players are stronger
what's<00:02:15.709> your<00:02:15.800> opinion<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> nine<00:02:16.610> other

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
what's your opinion on the nine other

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.699 
what's your opinion on the nine other
teams<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.810> you're<00:02:17.900> competing<00:02:18.170> against<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
teams that you're competing against the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
teams that you're competing against the
next<00:02:18.920> couple<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.099> weeks<00:02:19.280> well<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:20.930> came

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
next couple of weeks well so we came

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140 
next couple of weeks well so we came
into<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.590> game<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.010> elements<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.580> as<00:02:22.879> strong

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
into the game that elements is as strong

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.759 
into the game that elements is as strong
as<00:02:23.209> phonetic<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.870> think<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
as phonetic I think in the in the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.199 
as phonetic I think in the in the
current<00:02:25.129> at<00:02:25.250> CS<00:02:25.519> they're<00:02:25.700> like<00:02:25.879> all<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
current at CS they're like all the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.390 
current at CS they're like all the
strong<00:02:26.360> teams<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> be

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
strong teams so I think it's going to be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.890 
strong teams so I think it's going to be
exciting<00:02:28.640> who<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.120> going<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> top

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
exciting who is going to be on the top

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.800 
exciting who is going to be on the top
and<00:02:30.140> our<00:02:31.130> goal<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.790> at<00:02:32.360> least<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and our goal is to be at least in the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.440 
and our goal is to be at least in the
top<00:02:32.840> six<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.739> playoffs<00:02:33.920> again<00:02:34.280> team<00:02:35.269> that

a team that pushed SKT 32 to hearing you
say<00:02:41.780> top<00:02:42.140> six<00:02:42.739> are<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.910> not<00:02:44.150> aiming<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.690> little
