 Well, we entered here 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.650
 all right 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.550

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.759
 all right 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.330
 but we also heat 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.110
 I'm going to make one of my post on the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.110
 Mind hit rock 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.659
 flights because I'm not going to use it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.659
 almost 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.230
 and good here 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.740
 we have the two fossils this is the fossil 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 Following here we have Libya 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.070

 destroy the mirage tower 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.380
 good and it says that in the root fossil has 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.130
 disappeared do not worry 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.370

 sure that here was the fossil 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.319
 good root depends on what fossil you take 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.520
 that wall in the other you see here is therefore 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.520
