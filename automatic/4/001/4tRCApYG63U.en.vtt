00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
okay now the next one that look at is

okay now the next one that look at is
the<00:00:03.600> single<00:00:04.380> stroke<00:00:04.650> roll<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.520> probably

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the single stroke roll this is probably

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.039 
the single stroke roll this is probably
the<00:00:05.850> most<00:00:05.879> common<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:06.509> it's<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:06.839> going

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
French grip for the single stroke roll

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
French grip for the single stroke roll
feel<00:00:40.829> comfortable<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:41.610> use<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> molar

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
feel comfortable I also use the molar

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
on model stroke that you'll learn a lot

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
on model stroke that you'll learn a lot
from<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> UM<00:00:53.340> there's<00:00:53.879> lots<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.149> different

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
from it the UM there's lots of different

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.580 
from it the UM there's lots of different
strokes<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> beginning<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
strokes as I said at the beginning of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.990 
strokes as I said at the beginning of
the<00:00:55.710> David<00:00:56.010> aim<00:00:56.129> anyway<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> should<00:00:59.940> be

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the David aim anyway so you should be

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.130 
the David aim anyway so you should be
able<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.449> single<00:01:00.629> strokes<00:01:00.989> into

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
able to go from single strokes into

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
able to go from single strokes into
double<00:01:01.410> strokes<00:01:10.040> I<00:01:13.490> first<00:01:14.490> did<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.760> slowly

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
double strokes I first did them slowly

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.310 
double strokes I first did them slowly
and<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.689> am<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.740> going

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.110 

what<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> used<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.670> young<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
what I used to do when I was young I

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.580 
what I used to do when I was young I
used<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.390> sit<00:01:21.750> down<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.020> drum<00:01:22.260> kit<00:01:22.290> every

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
used to sit down to my drum kit every

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
used to sit down to my drum kit every
time<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> started<00:01:23.040> practicing<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> I'd<00:01:24.360> put<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
time I started practicing and I'd put a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
time I started practicing and I'd put a
metronome<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.490> try<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.030> for

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
metronome on and I try and do this for

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
metronome on and I try and do this for
15<00:01:27.479> minutes<00:01:33.170> do<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.350> 15<00:01:34.710> minutes<00:01:34.979> without

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
15 minutes do it for 15 minutes without

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.140 
15 minutes do it for 15 minutes without
doing<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:37.190> throwing<00:01:38.190> one<00:01:38.520> loud<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:38.970> soft

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
doing this throwing one loud or soft

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
doing this throwing one loud or soft
note<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.050> used<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.440> well

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
note in there and I used to think well

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
note in there and I used to think well
if<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.190> 15<00:01:41.490> minutes<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
if I can do that for 15 minutes that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
if I can do that for 15 minutes that
means<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.300> can<00:01:42.420> concentrate<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
means I can concentrate and if I can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
means I can concentrate and if I can
concentrate<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.160> can<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.369> anything<00:01:44.580> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
concentrate then I can do anything that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.740 
concentrate then I can do anything that
was<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.330> theory<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> seems<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.229> work<00:01:50.750> okay

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
was my theory and it seems to work okay

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.859 
was my theory and it seems to work okay
so<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> single<00:01:52.500> strokes<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:54.600> you've<00:01:54.720> got

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so the single strokes then you've got

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.210 
so the single strokes then you've got
the<00:01:54.990> triple<00:01:55.229> stroke<00:01:55.560> roll<00:01:55.800> which<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
the triple stroke roll which a lot of

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.529 
the triple stroke roll which a lot of
guys<00:01:56.340> aren't<00:01:56.550> aware<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.030> triple<00:01:57.300> stroke

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
guys aren't aware of the triple stroke

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:11.740 
guys aren't aware of the triple stroke
roll<00:01:57.780> three<00:01:58.320> notes<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.619> each<00:01:58.710> hand<00:02:10.730> I

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
roll three notes in each hand I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.060 
roll three notes in each hand I
encourage<00:02:12.750> people<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> idea<00:02:13.950> of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
encourage people just get the idea of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.510 
encourage people just get the idea of
first<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.550> one<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:14.820> three<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.180> two<00:02:15.209> three
