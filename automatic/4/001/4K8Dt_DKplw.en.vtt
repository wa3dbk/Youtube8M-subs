00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.859
 I'm on a trip and doing a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.080
 test on this car that came from the repair 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.519
 and your exchange rate is on the 12th of this month 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 this car was called until 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.820
 concessionaire of the city of ipatinga 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.990
 so that we can intervene 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.110
 next items né 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.270
 This one is with a crown 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:44.640
 the differential was made this exchange were 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.590
 made if this intervention did and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.300
 today I'm riding in the car and show 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.149
 for you the noise of the car 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.660
 remains the same noise as you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660
 can see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.180
 a fifth gear or with the fourth largest 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 fourth gear 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.240
 the noise continued even on a visit to 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 dealer when I saw the box 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.229
 open gear I could see that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.500
 this car was a crown of 58 teeth 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.740
 a pawn of 15 teeth in a ratio of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:34.270
 speed of 3.86 and today that car 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.390
 with a crown of 56 teeth and a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.080
 pawn that is secondary to 15 teeth 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.899
 in a speed ratio of 3 points 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.710
 73 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.780
 at first it was reported that the car and the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.539
 already with a higher consumption I will 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.490
 show you cigarette smoking 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.600
 He is with alcohol only traveling through 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 alcohol at the moment it is making 10.4 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.140
 the same average you were doing before 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.670
 he is currently doing the same 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.880
 average overtake this car here 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 passing here 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.519
 he is with the same average of him, right? 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.519
 and only after loading 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.300
 disturbing the traffic here shocked to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 yield a little more at a speed of 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:38.300
 100 km and the noise persists the same 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.980
 noise is noisy even what I 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.960
 I noticed in the car 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.910
 at first he improved a little 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.540
 to walk the team had a little more 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.690
 sheet was a popular car in the middle car 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.010
 slow and with a little smarter in the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.700
 Speed ​​is not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.630
 in the beginning I even liked it 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.640
 of this 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.459
 and another also another issue as well 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.740
 which ended with an embarrassment that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.280
 had in it had a few strides 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.980

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.300
 and today he does not have it anymore.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.210
 solved the intervention that the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:36.180
 fiat made in that car on the 12th of the five 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.140
