00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.390
 Mother hand strokes 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.650
 Light pink 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.770
 I tried to compare how to strike 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.669
 Expected return is the number one team in brics 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.669
 From desks and stances to Noh 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.730
 Nagamatsu Top Spin- 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.419
 It is full-time work 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.459
 Standing and turning illegal rate carrera 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
 There are really good players 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 I already have one day on a postage stamp 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.980
 While people are falling down 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 not yet 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.260
 From the Espal grip end 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 I was pulling up to the club members 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.090
 Physical examination that was more than all 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 Frista 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.230
 I'm approaching the goal 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 This attomini 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.860
 Topspin on the street 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 The ruling party by making a movie 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.100
 Wrap around the body 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 In the form of a way 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.660
 From 3rd 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
 I want to 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
 Sugiyama is 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.880
 One at home 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 Let's pay attention to a certain daytime market in j1 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 The battlefield is stretching the left hand sideways 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 It is after this to say how it is used 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.610
 Still left behind 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.820
 Of the right shoulder being drawn towards the Ota sum 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 The previous day's rotation 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.540
 The agreed organic type is slightly below 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.650
 I'll do it 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.320
 Turning an alert is 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 When bringing it back from the lower body 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.499
 I think that's how it was 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.179
 From Hanshin 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.539
 Power is important, but stop by arrest for a little corpse abandonment 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.289
 I'm going to pull back 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.509
 Allied rotation 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.989
 help 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.359
 Because it leads to the stability of the axis, many people a little 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 I'm going to be able to use effectively 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.349
 From above 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.139
 But there 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.139
 It is a match 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.180
 I retired
