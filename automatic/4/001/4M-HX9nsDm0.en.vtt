00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.110 
positive and constructive things in team
chat<00:02:56.620> has<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> much<00:02:57.310> better<00:02:57.519> effect<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
chat has a much better effect on the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.210 
chat has a much better effect on the
game<00:02:58.329> then<00:02:58.629> harassment<00:02:59.200> rage<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.650> trolling

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
game then harassment rage in trolling

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220 
game then harassment rage in trolling
also<00:03:01.120> during<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.450> time<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> prayer<00:03:02.110> is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
account I think this is a great idea in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.949 
account I think this is a great idea in
theory<00:03:07.819> but<00:03:07.970> I'm<00:03:08.209> not<00:03:08.420> sure<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> would

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
theory but I'm not sure how I would

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.260 
theory but I'm not sure how I would
actually<00:03:09.380> work<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.680> practice<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.430> mean<00:03:11.000> how

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
actually work in practice I mean how

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.520 
actually work in practice I mean how
would<00:03:11.330> they<00:03:11.630> know<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.230> player<00:03:12.500> is

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
