00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.479
 news 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.530
 so already I'm just going through 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.000
 start with the most interesting so 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 the over 400 that just be 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.740

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.310
 started making it under real prefect 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.620
 them ie to develop 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 here I was looking for the word a week 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.130
 after the release of gta 5 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.530
 we follow a turn and a five who came out 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.750
 in the month of September 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.760
 it's only hamburg of ctu one without 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.510
 the need I know September 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.349
 no longer so you see here and there it will be 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.569
 expected 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.959
 there is no specific date but it's 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.780
 end of 2016 early 2010 is so it's a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.840
 pretty good date pass of such a saint 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 which frankly is not any priest 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.240
 will be long enough me I would have 18 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.910
 years to me so it will be 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.990
 in my time anyway you hide it 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:56.600
 it does not seem that it will be one to five 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:00.350
 times in the fleet will be a day of gt5 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.620
 romands say we can say in hindsight 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.710
 as one of the communal agents 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.710
 concentrated quechua old friends 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.170

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.810
 manufacturing development into account 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.820
 planned to house a barter 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.890

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.930
