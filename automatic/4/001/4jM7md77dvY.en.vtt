really like has a wood finish it's a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.860 
really like has a wood finish it's a
bamboo<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:45.120> Hollow<00:02:45.540> it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
bamboo actually and it's not Hollow it's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.550 
bamboo actually and it's not Hollow it's
actually<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:47.610> know<00:02:47.730> dance<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.470> for<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
actually like you know dance and for the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
actually like you know dance and for the
price<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:49.950> getting<00:02:50.190> since<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.790> are

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
price that you're getting since they are

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.690 
price that you're getting since they are
around<00:02:51.630> eleven<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.170> twelve<00:02:52.200> dollars<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.980> think

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
around eleven or twelve dollars I think

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340 
around eleven or twelve dollars I think
that<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:54.450> getting<00:02:54.720> more<00:02:54.900> from<00:02:55.200> what

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
that you're getting more from what

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.500 
that you're getting more from what
you're<00:02:55.530> paying<00:02:55.740> for<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.940> mean<00:02:57.240> they<00:02:57.390> don't

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
you're paying for so I mean they don't

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.200 
you're paying for so I mean they don't
feel<00:02:57.810> cheap<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:58.860> I've<00:02:59.220> had<00:02:59.250> brushes<00:02:59.760> that

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
feel cheap because I've had brushes that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.970 
feel cheap because I've had brushes that
are<00:03:02.209> they<00:03:03.209> were<00:03:03.270> was<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.380> same<00:03:04.590> price<00:03:04.950> but

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
are they were was the same price but

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.370 
are they were was the same price but
they<00:03:05.459> felt<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.239> cheap<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.870> stuff

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
they felt really really cheap and stuff

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.449 
they felt really really cheap and stuff
like<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.790> um<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.660> these<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.459> slightly

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
like that so um for these to be slightly

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.390 
like that so um for these to be slightly
heavier<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.709> think<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.890> you're<00:03:14.070> getting<00:03:14.310> a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300 
heavier I think that you're getting a
lot<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.850> what<00:03:15.000> she<00:03:15.209> what<00:03:15.870> she<00:03:15.900> paid<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.590> but

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
lot for what she what she paid for but

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.229 
lot for what she what she paid for but

that I think it's a great idea um the
only<00:04:44.340> thing<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.789> I<00:04:44.820> didn't<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.210> about<00:04:45.389> this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
only thing that I didn't like about this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.629 
only thing that I didn't like about this
product<00:04:46.169> is<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.320> in<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.800> actual<00:04:47.099> path<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
product is that in the actual path the

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.390 
product is that in the actual path the
packaging<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:49.169> green<00:04:49.380> background<00:04:49.710> part<00:04:50.280> of

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
packaging the green background part of

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.540 
packaging the green background part of
it<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.759> made<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.500> fabric<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.130> think<00:04:53.400> it's

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
it is made of on the fabric I think it's

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.600 
it is made of on the fabric I think it's
also<00:04:53.789> made<00:04:54.599> on<00:04:54.750> natural<00:04:55.139> cotton<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.710> hemp<00:04:55.740> but

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
also made on natural cotton and hemp but

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.029 
also made on natural cotton and hemp but
you're<00:04:57.599> going<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.900> throw<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.229> away<00:04:58.349> so<00:04:58.590> I'm

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
you're going to throw it away so I'm

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.980 
you're going to throw it away so I'm
like<00:04:59.280> well<00:04:59.550> that's<00:04:59.820> kind<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.180> defeating<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
like well that's kind of defeating the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.159 
like well that's kind of defeating the
whole<00:05:01.080> purpose<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:03.389> know<00:05:03.539> seeing<00:05:03.960> earth

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
whole purpose of you know seeing earth

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.730 
whole purpose of you know seeing earth
friendly<00:05:04.500> since<00:05:05.099> this<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.520> earth<00:05:05.759> friendly

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
friendly since this is earth friendly

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.740 
friendly since this is earth friendly
type<00:05:07.740> of<00:05:07.889> brushes<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.520> didn't<00:05:09.150> like<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.300> since

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
type of brushes I didn't like that since

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.189 
type of brushes I didn't like that since
you<00:05:10.740> know<00:05:10.860> their<00:05:11.190> um<00:05:11.460> their<00:05:11.960> main<00:05:12.960> thing<00:05:13.169> is

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
you know their um their main thing is

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.500 
you know their um their main thing is
like<00:05:13.440> not<00:05:13.710> wasting<00:05:14.340> materials<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.300> stuff

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
like not wasting materials and stuff

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.930 
like not wasting materials and stuff
like<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:16.470> you're<00:05:17.400> gonna<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:17.849> throw

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
like that but you're gonna just throw

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.439 
like that but you're gonna just throw
away<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.870> know<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:20.370> piece<00:05:20.970> of<00:05:21.000> fabric

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
away that you know that piece of fabric

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.270 
away that you know that piece of fabric
so<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.139> just<00:05:22.320> thought<00:05:22.530> they<00:05:22.740> were<00:05:22.800> kind<00:05:23.130> of

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
so I just thought they were kind of

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.129 
so I just thought they were kind of
contradicting<00:05:24.000> yourself<00:05:24.180> from<00:05:24.630> they<00:05:24.780> did

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
contradicting yourself from they did

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.620 
contradicting yourself from they did
that<00:05:25.349> but<00:05:26.130> for<00:05:27.000> those<00:05:27.090> of<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.419> who<00:05:27.659> like

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
that but for those of you who like

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.540 
that but for those of you who like
brushes<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.930> need<00:05:31.409> brushes<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:31.919> are<00:05:32.190> like

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
brushes that need brushes that are like

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.279 
brushes that need brushes that are like
you<00:05:32.699> know<00:05:32.820> better<00:05:33.150> quality<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:33.900> stuff<00:05:34.139> like

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
you know better quality and stuff like

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.490 
you know better quality and stuff like
that<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.680> think<00:05:35.190> these<00:05:35.340> are<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:36.510> good

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500
