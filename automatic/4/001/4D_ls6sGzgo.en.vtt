00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
 remember there is number 14 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.850
 change 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.730
 I change the cycle at the 12th point 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.210
 perfect 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.049
 what do we do to put it 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.049
 in the box 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.670
 we have finished our process 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.780
 we can use 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.780
 we have at hand 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 you have to get it out of the crown there is no 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 in the type of base cups to put 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.710
 the watches in this case as you already have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.850
 some needles we can not put it on 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.329
 a flat base hurt us 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.720
 then seek a hollow base so 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.010
 say it 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.230
 where I take the bezel no more 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.230
 and the needles are free look 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.600
 to the needles 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.140
 how well we do it 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.750
 bet hours as in the beginning 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.750
 we see that the little eye comes out remember 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.710
 and we press very soft 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.360
 we send back 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780
 there went out 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.760
 our machinery so for example 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.580
 then with the air pear is great 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.030
 the one that we take a breath to clean 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.430
 those interiors we blow the box 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 previously we can give you a brushing 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.960
 internal 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.960
 if it's very dirty if we see it 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.470
 deteriorated 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.750
 so that these residues do not bring 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.990
 so easy on the machinery and not having 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.990
 with clear weather these annoyances 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.910
 the board we also blow it 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.220
 have the rings 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.480
 same sivensa 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.480
 diverse english 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 we have that inside the box 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 if we observe it here 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 remember that you have a part of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.480
 push button is 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.480
 because internally is 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:54.140
 and this is what makes the rapid pace of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:58.459
 hotel calendar the days of the letters 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.930
 then when we enter it we say 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.200
 in this way lateral 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.950
 so that it matches 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.580
 with the point 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 While 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.970
 we have 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.620
 come on 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.620
 here is at this point 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 depression 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.519
 we put the crown 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.280
 the entrance 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.060
 the crown 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.060
 gently 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.800
 good 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.490
 that we go on the other side and God 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.230
 we do not have 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.230
 soft there he entered 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.490
 there was a contract that remember this 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.680
 contract that was cited is so that 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.770
 the clock does not move 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.630
 the machinery does not 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.090
 after they come they move then 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.690
 is going to fall is not going to roll the mass the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.790
 mass will stick to the cover this base 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.220
 just like elvis the first one that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.739
 we put on the board has two entries 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:26.790
 this kind of tickets one for the crown 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.790
 for the seatpost here and another for the pushbutton 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.120
 they are very good 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.100
 just remember always carefully with 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.100
 the steering wheel 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.860
 and it was 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.590
 9 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.220
 when the lid feels 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.220
 all right 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.830
 there are small little details that suddenly 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.100
 the time to assemble make us have 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.120
 some faults 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.800
 in the work of the clock 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.560
 after having verified that he was 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.419
 everything perfect fine we go with the lid 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.729
 we have a clean brush we can 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.460
 do what 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.770
 Benzine also helps a touch 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.689
 This already as I see I have a brush 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.569
 thicker in a stronger sow 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.210
 here more is required 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.210
 Well, they are not worse 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.759
 the detail of the 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.419
 delicate work in this part for 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.419
 remove residues 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.610
 the same a little dish a pear 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.520
 to the box 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.840
 and we have the key 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.790
 initial 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.740
 with which we uncover we give 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:04.889
 the pressure 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.009
 strange brings her eyelashes in these 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.259
 so 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.259
 to avoid that we are going to get 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:16.409
 there is a stronger pressure 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.960
 is for glass change because it is 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.300
 something fuzzy but there goes working a 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.819
 beginning remember that we did not have the 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.339
 we had to move it there 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.339
 this constant again
