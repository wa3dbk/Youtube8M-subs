00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
first year ever to VidCon so I have no

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
first year ever to VidCon so I have no
idea<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> whole<00:01:02.039> shebang<00:01:02.340> works

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
idea how the whole shebang works

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
idea how the whole shebang works
hopefully<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> two-day<00:01:04.920> pass

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
