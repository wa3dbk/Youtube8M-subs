00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.250
 i 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.250
 two 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.230
 ah 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.500
 but friends of the grill with manolo el 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 today we are going to make a cheese 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 fused and these are our 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.990
 ingredients the first thing we're going to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 to do is put the butter in the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.330
 container in which we are going to do it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 in this case it is mud because it is more 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.620
 easy for the pitcher after we go to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.449
 add a little milk and then the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.110
 cheese the cheese can be 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.659
 chihuahua- manchego gouda oaxaca 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 anyone who melts and then 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.630
 we put a chorizo 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.580
 We put it on the grill and close it 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.030
 to our egg so that it starts 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.030
 melt 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.920
 here as we see is an average temperature 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.320
 at about 200 degrees it's fine 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.120
 approximately the cheese is going to take 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.390
 in being ready about 10 more minutes or 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.760
 less depending on how many times you 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.100
 let's open our grill in case 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.130
 we do it in an open grill the only thing 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 What we have to do is put on her little 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.590
 aluminum foil and with that we have here 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 we are seeing how it is going 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.979
 melting our cheese and we're going to 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.979
 re -close the lid to our egg 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.440
 well at this moment we have our 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.380
 smoked cheese ready 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.100
 and we 're going to take it to the table 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.330
 serve it this cheese we can not eat in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.540
 quesadillas with meat we can 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.990
 accompany with sauce and other things truth 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.630
 at the moment of removing the container there is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.390
 to be careful in this case I'm 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 using gloves to take out the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.970
 container and also the surface in the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.140
 that we put it needs to support the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.660
 heat from our container true good 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.460
 here we are seeing we can make a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.730
 quesadilla as for example as what 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.360
 we are looking here and our cheese is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.110
 ready 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.110
 good friends 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.730
