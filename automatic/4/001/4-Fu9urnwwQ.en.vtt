out<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:31.650> instead<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.800> using<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> solid

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
out is instead of using just a solid

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
out is instead of using just a solid
color<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.390> can<00:02:34.510> go<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.750> color<00:02:35.020> gradients<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
color you can go to color gradients and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.590 
color you can go to color gradients and
near<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:39.940> how<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.300> kind<00:02:40.330> of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
near that you see how it's kind of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.570 
near that you see how it's kind of
coolidge<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.710> bones<00:02:41.950> into<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> different

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
coolidge like it bones into a different

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.670 
coolidge like it bones into a different
color<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:44.010> muscle<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.160> really<00:02:45.550> um<00:02:46.440> mostly<00:02:47.440> use

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
color a muscle I really um mostly use

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.440 
color a muscle I really um mostly use
like<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.460> extremely<00:02:49.390> light<00:02:49.930> pink<00:02:50.820> um<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
like this extremely light pink um and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.620 
like this extremely light pink um and
then<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.960> go<00:02:53.170> with<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.710> this<00:02:53.950> reddish<00:02:54.630> like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
then I go with like this reddish like

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.910 
then I go with like this reddish like
it's<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.050> pink<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.590> more<00:02:56.770> like

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it's not really pink is more like

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:10.220 
it's not really pink is more like
flamingos<00:02:57.430> red<00:02:57.760> yes<00:02:59.130> kind<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:06.510> no<00:03:07.510> go<00:03:08.310> yeah

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
flamingos red yes kind of no go yeah

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.080 
flamingos red yes kind of no go yeah
okay<00:03:11.230> yeah<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.190> see<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.580> how<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.910> like

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
okay yeah you can see like how it's like

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.960 
okay yeah you can see like how it's like
it<00:03:13.450> pops<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.930> more<00:03:14.170> than<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:15.040> plain

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it pops out more than just the plain

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.790 
it pops out more than just the plain
blue<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.430> make<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:19.510> become<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> circle

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
blue and to make it like become a circle

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.100 
blue and to make it like become a circle
like<00:03:21.040> um<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:22.750> will<00:03:22.930> you'll<00:03:23.110> see<00:03:23.580> um<00:03:24.580> right<00:03:25.110> here

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.250 
like um we will you'll see um right here
on<00:03:26.530> your<00:03:27.100> timeline<00:03:27.400> below<00:03:28.270> all<00:03:28.810> your<00:03:28.990> settings

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
on your timeline below all your settings

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.720 
on your timeline below all your settings
um<00:03:30.390> make<00:03:31.390> sure<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.870> have<00:03:32.080> your<00:03:32.110> sink<00:03:32.980> cursor

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
um make sure to have your sink cursor

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.260 
um make sure to have your sink cursor
lock<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:36.660> well<00:03:38.370> okay<00:03:39.370> let's<00:03:39.790> say<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.000> wanted

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
lock on and well okay let's say I wanted

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.770 
lock on and well okay let's say I wanted
to<00:03:40.390> pop<00:03:40.600> out<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:44.580> okay<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.570> add<00:03:46.750> a

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
to pop out at one okay so just add a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.470 
to pop out at one okay so just add a
keyframe<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.670> basically<00:03:48.670> what<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.940> do<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.360> I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
keyframe and basically what I do is I

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.690 
keyframe and basically what I do is I
just<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.810> settings<00:03:50.170> first<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.160> won't<00:03:51.550> have

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
just the settings first so I won't have

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.730 
just the settings first so I won't have
to<00:03:51.820> do<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.030> later<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.780> trust<00:03:53.140> me<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.500> way

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
to do it later on and trust me this way

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.790 
to do it later on and trust me this way
will<00:03:53.980> work<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.400> lot<00:03:55.120> better<00:03:55.570> than<00:03:56.560> what<00:03:56.680> you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
will work a lot better than what you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.610 
will work a lot better than what you
originally<00:03:56.860> planned<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.570> then<00:03:58.930> go<00:03:59.440> back

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
originally planned so and then go back

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.190 
originally planned so and then go back
to<00:03:59.830> your<00:03:59.920> first<00:04:00.220> keyframe<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:01.000> then<00:04:01.209> make<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
to your first keyframe and then make the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.970 
to your first keyframe and then make the
size<00:04:02.350> zero<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.070> this<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.640> what<00:04:03.790> will<00:04:03.970> happen<00:04:04.330> oh

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
size zero so this is what will happen oh

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.070 
size zero so this is what will happen oh
come<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.570> okay<00:04:07.570> well<00:04:07.720> that's<00:04:07.810> kind<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.110> slow<00:04:08.410> um

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
come on okay well that's kind of slow um

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.400 
come on okay well that's kind of slow um
okay<00:04:12.300> yeah<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.360> see<00:04:13.570> how<00:04:13.780> light<00:04:14.020> grew<00:04:14.200> bigger

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
okay yeah you see how light grew bigger

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.360 
okay yeah you see how light grew bigger
yeah<00:04:15.010> so<00:04:15.880> basically<00:04:16.239> what<00:04:16.660> yeah<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:17.890> just<00:04:18.220> make

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
yeah so basically what yeah so just make

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.430 
yeah so basically what yeah so just make
to<00:04:18.520> keyframe<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.330> then<00:04:19.540> just<00:04:19.870> change<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
to keyframe and then just change the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.260 
to keyframe and then just change the
first<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.190> don't<00:04:21.640> have<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.060> mess

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
first one so you don't have to like mess

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.140 
first one so you don't have to like mess
around

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
around

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.550 
around
and<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:23.690> place<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.350> everything<00:04:24.830> um<00:04:26.560> I'm

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
pretty sure that's home and there's more
