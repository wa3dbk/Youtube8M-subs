00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of miniature Star Wars blasters in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.440 
of miniature Star Wars blasters in
they're<00:00:12.590> about<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.889> same<00:00:14.099> size<00:00:14.160> as<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> reflex

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
they're about the same size as a reflex

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.960 
they're about the same size as a reflex
they're<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.529> bit<00:00:16.710> bigger<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> they

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
they're a little bit bigger and they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.240 
they're a little bit bigger and they
have<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> different<00:00:18.539> trigger<00:00:18.779> system<00:00:19.320> just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
have a different trigger system just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.070 
have a different trigger system just
that<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> trigger<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.720> really

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that the trigger is in this really

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.890 
that the trigger is in this really
narrow<00:00:22.380> kinda<00:00:23.449> opening<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
narrow kinda opening here and it's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720 
narrow kinda opening here and it's
difficult<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.500> me<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> fit<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:25.980> fingers<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
difficult for me to fit my fingers in it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
difficult for me to fit my fingers in it
it's<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> awkward<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.800> work

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
it's kind of awkward but they all work

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.919 
it's kind of awkward but they all work
the<00:00:29.070> same<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> reflex<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> they've

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the same way as the reflex and they've

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
the same way as the reflex and they've
got<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> cocking<00:00:31.619> slide<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> fire<00:00:32.669> like

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
got a cocking slide and you fire like

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
got a cocking slide and you fire like
that<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:34.170> seem<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> same

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that they seem to have about the same

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.510 
that they seem to have about the same
power<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> stock<00:00:36.540> reflex<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.399> an

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
power as a stock reflex but they have an

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.830 
power as a stock reflex but they have an
interesting<00:00:38.910> style<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:41.210> dart<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.570> comes

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
interesting style of dart that comes

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840 
interesting style of dart that comes
with<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.290> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.890> regular<00:00:44.100> Nerf<00:00:44.550> dart

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
with them instead of a regular Nerf dart

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
with them instead of a regular Nerf dart
like<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> screamer<00:00:45.690> dart<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.530> has<00:00:47.059> foam

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

and then a rubber tip it has a rubber
tip<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.360> look<00:00:54.360> back<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.140> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
tip that if you look back here you can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.459 
tip that if you look back here you can
see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.640> rubber<00:00:56.879> extends<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.109> down

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

Wars<00:01:44.520> blaster<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.320> get<00:01:46.320> about<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.430> range

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
Wars blaster I get about the same range

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
Wars blaster I get about the same range
as<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> stock<00:01:48.600> darts<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
as I get with the stock darts but when I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780 
as I get with the stock darts but when I
shoot<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:50.130> darts

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
with one of my modified reflexes I get

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.590 
with one of my modified reflexes I get
just<00:01:56.909> incredible<00:01:57.630> ranges<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> love<00:01:58.740> these

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
just incredible ranges I love these

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.820 
just incredible ranges I love these
I<00:01:59.840> think<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.170> they're<00:02:00.320> much<00:02:00.470> tougher

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I think that they're much tougher

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.310 
I think that they're much tougher
they're<00:02:01.190> more<00:02:01.400> durable<00:02:01.690> but<00:02:02.690> just<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.140> show

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
they're more durable but just to show

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.440 
they're more durable but just to show

really appreciate it because I can't
decide<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.050> think<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:57.770> would<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:57.950> better

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
decide I think this one would be better

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.729 
decide I think this one would be better
for<00:02:58.310> holster<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.270> narrower<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.560> one

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
for holster and narrower but this one

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.830 
for holster and narrower but this one
has<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> lot<00:03:01.310> more<00:03:01.340> detailing<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.780> I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
has a lot more detailing on it and I

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.300 
has a lot more detailing on it and I
think<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.230> would<00:03:03.350> lend<00:03:03.590> itself<00:03:04.010> better

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
think it would lend itself better

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.210 
think it would lend itself better
