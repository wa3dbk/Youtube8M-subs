the vendors over the last few days about

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.670 
the vendors over the last few days about
what<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.219> think<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.730> macworld<00:00:15.509> 2010<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
what they think about macworld 2010 and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.410 
what they think about macworld 2010 and
where<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.310> show<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.119> go

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
where they think the show is going to go

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
where they think the show is going to go
and<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.529> I've<00:00:19.770> found<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.400> be

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and one thing that I've found to be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240 
and one thing that I've found to be
consistent<00:00:21.449> among<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.439> they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
consistent among all of them is they

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
consistent among all of them is they
want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> know<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.210> kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.600> show<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.769> and

what I mean by that is there's a lot of
different<00:00:28.590> kinds<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> shows<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.189> are

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it appears based on talking to these

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.950 
it appears based on talking to these
vendors<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.700> show<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.390> people

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
vendors they want is a show where people

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
vendors they want is a show where people
are<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.680> come<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> make<00:00:53.460> purchases

are going to come in and make purchases

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.680 
are going to come in and make purchases
so<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> people<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.620> exactly<00:00:56.690> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so that people will know exactly you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.139 
so that people will know exactly you
know<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.430> what<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.579> person<00:00:59.789> described

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
know more like what one person described

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
know more like what one person described
to<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.300> more<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.570> something<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> comic

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to me more like something like a comic

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.709 
to me more like something like a comic
book<00:01:02.039> convention<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> science<00:01:03.570> fiction

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
book convention or a science fiction

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
book convention or a science fiction
convention<00:01:03.930> where<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
convention where the you know the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
convention where the you know the
attendees<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.740> spend<00:01:08.040> money<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
attendees are there to spend money and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
attendees are there to spend money and
you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> makes<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> sense

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you know that makes a lot of sense

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
you know that makes a lot of sense
because<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> these

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
because it would make it so that these

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
because it would make it so that these
guys<00:01:12.119> could<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.659> their<00:01:12.869> money<00:01:13.110> back<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
guys could get their money back on the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.710 
guys could get their money back on the
huge<00:01:14.430> investments<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.509> through

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
huge investments they have to go through

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.140 
huge investments they have to go through
to<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> show<00:01:17.369> together<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to put this kind of show together and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.560 
to put this kind of show together and
right<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.570> happening

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
right now that's not actually happening

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
right now that's not actually happening
so<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.369> it'll<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.820> interesting<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.330> see

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so you know it'll be interesting to see

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
so you know it'll be interesting to see
sort<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.930> where<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> show<00:01:25.950> goes<00:01:26.220> from<00:01:26.400> here

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
sort of where the show goes from here

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.050 
sort of where the show goes from here
but<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.780> hope<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
but I do a hope that they look at that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
but I do a hope that they look at that
and<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> town<00:01:31.229> hall<00:01:31.500> meeting<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> know

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and that the town hall meeting you know

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
and that the town hall meeting you know
has<00:01:32.220> resulted<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.360> may<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> better

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
has resulted in it may be a better

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
has resulted in it may be a better
understanding<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> DG's<00:01:35.400> part

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
understanding of that on I DG's part

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
understanding of that on I DG's part
because<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.470> very

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
because I think that it's it's very

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.670 
because I think that it's it's very
clear<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.549> show<00:01:38.759> needs<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.270> rebrand<00:01:39.720> for
