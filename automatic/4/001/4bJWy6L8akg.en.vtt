center line of your body is a really

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.869 
center line of your body is a really
hard<00:00:36.210> place<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.809> most<00:00:37.110> people<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.879> defend

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hard place for most people to defend

centreline<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.250> well<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.180> easy

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
centreline very very well and it's easy

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
centreline very very well and it's easy
to<00:00:42.540> take<00:00:42.690> advantage<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.200> especially<00:00:43.469> when

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
to take advantage I especially when

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
to take advantage I especially when
you're<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> real<00:00:44.399> street<00:00:44.730> fight<00:00:44.940> your

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you're in a real street fight your

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
you're in a real street fight your
adrenalized<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.039> hands<00:00:47.250> tend<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> not

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
adrenalized the the hands tend to not

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
adrenalized the the hands tend to not
focus<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.390> coming<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> inside<00:00:49.320> defend<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
focus on coming in the inside defend to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.590 
focus on coming in the inside defend to
go<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> outside<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.000> focus<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.420> on

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
go to the outside and focus more on

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
go to the outside and focus more on
striking<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> center<00:00:53.129> line<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> usually

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
striking so the center line is usually

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
striking so the center line is usually
open<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.750> attacker<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
open on your attacker the other thing is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
open on your attacker the other thing is
that<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.239> upper<00:00:57.449> cut<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> primary<00:00:58.199> target

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that in the upper cut the primary target

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
that in the upper cut the primary target
there<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.430> chin<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.660> when<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.170> up

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there is the chin so when you come up

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.160 
there is the chin so when you come up
the<00:01:01.739> chin<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the chin that is there that can be a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
the chin that is there that can be a
knockout<00:01:04.920> blow<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:06.000> ends<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.240> happening<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
knockout blow what ends up happening is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.679 
knockout blow what ends up happening is
it<00:01:07.170> tends<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> throw<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> head<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.760> hits<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it tends to throw the head back hits the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.090 
it tends to throw the head back hits the
nerves<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> back<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> spine<00:01:10.830> here

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
nerves in the back of the spine here

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
nerves in the back of the spine here
really<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> cinches<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
really this cinches down on them and it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
really this cinches down on them and it
can<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.900> an<00:01:12.990> instant<00:01:13.409> knockout<00:01:13.920> blow<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> very

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can be an instant knockout blow and very

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
can be an instant knockout blow and very
very<00:01:15.450> powerful<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.220> problem<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.759> though

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
very powerful now the problem is though

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
very powerful now the problem is though
with<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> upper<00:01:19.200> cut<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> number<00:01:20.250> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
with the upper cut it's the number one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
with the upper cut it's the number one
if<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> boxing<00:01:21.330> ring<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:22.110> don't

if I have big gloves on it gives me a

here and in a fight people aren't
staying<00:01:42.450> stationary<00:01:42.750> they're<00:01:43.229> moving<00:01:43.619> around

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
staying stationary they're moving around

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
staying stationary they're moving around
there<00:01:44.189> naturally<00:01:44.430> moving<00:01:45.030> during<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> fight

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
there naturally moving during the fight

there naturally moving during the fight
so<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.259> try<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.470> come<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.920> uppercut

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so as I try to come up with an uppercut

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
so as I try to come up with an uppercut
most<00:01:47.759> likely<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.630> hand<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> glance

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
most likely my hand is going to glance

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.050 
most likely my hand is going to glance
off<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.820> i'm

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
off here I'm not going to really do i'm

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
off here I'm not going to really do i'm
not<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.540> head<00:01:51.750> snap<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.590> i'm

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
not going to get that head snap that i'm

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
not going to get that head snap that i'm
really<00:01:52.920> trying<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> accomplish<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
really trying to accomplish there the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
really trying to accomplish there the
other<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:56.040> you're<00:01:56.219> trying

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
other thing is that when you're trying

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
other thing is that when you're trying
to<00:01:56.579> punch<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.000> an<00:01:57.090> uppercut<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.170> end<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to punch with an uppercut you end up the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.969 
to punch with an uppercut you end up the
way<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.369> angle<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.680> wrist

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
way that the angle is is that your wrist

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.280 
way that the angle is is that your wrist
is<00:02:02.159> already<00:02:02.640> starting<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.270> bend<00:02:03.689> toward<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
is already starting to bend toward you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.440 
is already starting to bend toward you
so<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> come<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.130> even<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.579> i<00:02:05.670> make<00:02:05.969> i<00:02:06.149> finnaly

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so as I come in even if i make i finnaly

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
so as I come in even if i make i finnaly
vynn<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.170> target<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:08.190> ends<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.399> happening

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
vynn it my target what ends up happening

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.880 
vynn it my target what ends up happening
is<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.300> folds<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:09.959> wrist<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
is it really folds my wrist and you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
is it really folds my wrist and you
don't<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> take<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.700> primary

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
don't want to take out your primary

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
don't want to take out your primary
striking<00:02:12.870> tool<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:13.319> you're<00:02:13.440> doing

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
striking tool if you're doing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
striking tool if you're doing
this<00:02:14.040> hand<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.450> want<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.870> able

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
this hand right here you want to be able

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.930 
this hand right here you want to be able
to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.440> able<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.650> use<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.070> without<00:02:17.550> having<00:02:17.880> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
to be able to use this without having a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
to be able to use this without having a
broken<00:02:18.390> wrist<00:02:18.600> not<00:02:18.840> be<00:02:18.960> able<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.230> strike<00:02:19.530> with

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
broken wrist not be able to strike with

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
broken wrist not be able to strike with
it<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.280> there's<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.520> better<00:02:20.730> alternative<00:02:20.970> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it so there's a better alternative to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.080 
it so there's a better alternative to
the<00:02:21.810> uppercut<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.560> uses<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.190> same<00:02:23.460> benefits

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the uppercut that uses the same benefits

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
the uppercut that uses the same benefits
here<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.050> use<00:02:25.230> your<00:02:25.440> palm<00:02:25.680> heel

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
here and that's to use your palm heel

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
here and that's to use your palm heel
with<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> uppercut<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.930> here's<00:02:28.140> why<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.470> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
with the uppercut now here's why it's so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.990 
with the uppercut now here's why it's so
powerful<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.490> has<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> same

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
powerful that all it has the same

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180 
powerful that all it has the same
benefits<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:30.930> coming<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> center

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
benefits here as coming in the center

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
benefits here as coming in the center
line<00:02:32.370> okay<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.150> with<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> palm<00:02:33.990> heel

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
line okay so with the palm heel

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.200 
line okay so with the palm heel
basically<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> same<00:02:35.310> motion<00:02:35.850> but

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
basically you have the same motion but

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.810 
basically you have the same motion but
you're<00:02:36.390> striking<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.140> right<00:02:37.710> here<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> palm

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you're striking with right here the palm

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.360
