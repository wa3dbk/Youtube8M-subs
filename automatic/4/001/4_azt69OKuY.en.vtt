00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:20.390
 Hello! Welcome to Metabolism TV, your source of correct information about the metabolism 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.630
 and health. I am Frank Suárez, a specialist in obesity and metabolism. You know what? The 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.359
 Water saves you. Let's talk about water. We've talked before, but I want to emphasize 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.522
 on this topic because, let me tell you, the water does not announce it. Why do not they announce it? 

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:40.120
 Because he does not leave money. However, there is nothing so miraculous for the metabolism and for 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.960
 health as consuming enough water. Here we go, I'm going to move to the board and I'm going 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 to warn my friend Jorge because he says that I stop like that for the moment because I'm 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 intense. It's the fault of all that energy that I have. I will spend a moment explaining them. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:11.710
 Here we go, notice. Water is vital. The water saves you, look. If you have constipation 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.440
 you're not going to lose weight because constipation causes a toxic condition and that condition 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.890
 toxic in the body causes the body to reduce the metabolism, because the body fills up 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 of toxics, low oxygen and reduces metabolism. The water saves you. If you suffer 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.229
 of obesity you have to raise the metabolism. And to raise the metabolism it is impossible to climb 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.200
 the metabolism if you do not consume enough water. How much water do you have to consume? I'm going to give 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.450
 he formulates it again, I never tire of giving it. You say "How many pounds weight?", Let's say 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.870
 that you weigh 160 pounds, to say the least, you divide it by the number 16, the number that is, and you 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.310
 is going to give how many glasses of water you need per day. So if you weigh 240 pounds 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.060
 you divide it by 16, you get 15 glasses. If you are going to calculate it in kilograms, then you say how many 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.129
 kilograms and divided by the number 7. So if you calculate it by pounds it is divided 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.620
 by 16 and if you calculate it by kilograms it is by 7. Here you would give us 10 glasses of water at 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.159
 day. But you make your own calculation is based on your own body. The logic is that 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.849
 A small body needs little water and a large body needs a lot of water. If you have 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.909
 a tiny apartment, because with a cube of water you clean it, and if you have a mansion 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.159
 of 5 rooms, because you will need a lot of water to clean it. So that's the logic 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:45.319
 of that. Now we continue with the water, look. Water has everything to do with high pressure. 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.790
 When a person has high blood pressure, a doctor says "Ah! Is that your body 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.329
 is retaining water "and they give him a diuretic, which is to remove the water from the body. That 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.290
 it's a mistake. No, it's not a mistake to give the diuretic because you have to lower the pressure, the error 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.220
 is to think that the pressure is high simply and simply because the body is holding 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.879
 Water. Why does the body retain water? Well, let me tell you that it has been investigated what 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.540
 that is known, it retains water because it does not have water. Because when there is water shortage the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.709
 body is forced to stop all exits and then holds it compulsively. A) Yes 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.310
 that one of the most effective ways to lower the pressure is to drink enough water 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.360
 that the body can eliminate all toxics, has no water shortage and so 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.889
 He does not have to keep it that much. So many of the people who have swollen legs 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.519
 and others, they have them swollen due to lack of water. And you would say "Oh, but I have 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.549
 lots of water in the legs. " Of course you have a lot of water in your legs, your body is 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.600
 compulsively trying to retain her because she does not have. But you give him enough water 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.400
 and he is going to release that old water that you have there and then there is abundance and there are no problems. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.819
 So, what else does water save you? Water also saves you with sexual potency. 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 This has to do with men. There are already investigations that have been done where 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.589
 knows that a man's sexuality, the ability to have an erection, has everything to do 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:19.280
 with your level of hydration. Why? Because the penis is a hydraulic system that 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.949
 it fills with blood and the blood is 98% water, and the man who is dehydrated can not 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.199
 have a good erection and ends up with Viagra, or God knows what else, when 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.650
 Actually what I needed was water. So doñita attend, give me water, give me 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.690
 water to him. Then the same thing happens with the woman. The woman may have problems with 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.451
 your sexuality because you may have vaginal dryness. And when you have vaginal dryness 

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:51.430
 It will burn when you have sex and you will not enjoy it. It is also solved with water 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.060
 because water saves. So, from what we're seeing, water does not just help you 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.669
 with that, it helps you eliminate wrinkles or avoid wrinkles. What they call in Puerto 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.830
 Rico, they say the crow's feet, all that they call out there that the woman wrinkles. 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.590
 Well, many creams are being applied on the outside, but the problem is that the body is dry 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.360
 inside. So drinking lots of water prevents the body from wrinkling, the body avoids 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.870
 excess acidity in the body. When a person has excess stomach acid 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.849
 What is missing? Water. Anyone suffering from reflux or heartburn is dehydrated. 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.490
 When you drink water you urinate and what you urinate is always acid. Thus 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.610
 One of the most effective ways to lower the acidity of a body is to urinate. But you 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.379
 You can not urinate if you do not drink water. Therefore drinking lots of water eliminates acidity. So 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.409
 removes constipation, eliminates obesity, lowers high pressure, improves potency 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:59.650
 sexual, prevents wrinkles and lowers acidity. Notices? The water saves. And the truth always 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.050
 triumph
