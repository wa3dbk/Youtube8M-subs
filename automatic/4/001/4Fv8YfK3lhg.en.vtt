00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.039 
one of the square pieces of tissue paper
and<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.560> recommend<00:01:21.950> using<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.429> pin<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.719> because

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
and I recommend using a pin just because

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.380 
and I recommend using a pin just because
if<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.350> end<00:01:24.500> up<00:01:24.590> using<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.979> pencil<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.270> will

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
if you end up using a pencil and it will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.999 
if you end up using a pencil and it will
usually<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.960> glue<00:01:27.200> we're<00:01:27.439> going<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.649> be<00:01:27.740> using

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
usually the glue we're going to be using

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.889 
usually the glue we're going to be using
will<00:01:28.130> end<00:01:28.280> up<00:01:28.369> ruining<00:01:28.549> your<00:01:28.850> eraser<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:29.869> I

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
will end up ruining your eraser so I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.109 
will end up ruining your eraser so I
recommend<00:01:30.319> a<00:01:30.409> pin<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:31.340> take<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.729> square

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119
