max<00:02:23.430> speed<00:02:23.790> which<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.060> interesting<00:02:24.799> with

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
max speed which is interesting with

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.080 
max speed which is interesting with
thought<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.219> could<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.549> still<00:02:26.760> some<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
thought that could be still some kind of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
thought that could be still some kind of
Baton<00:02:27.389> Pass<00:02:27.420> head<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:28.019> assuming<00:02:28.349> it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
Baton Pass head but I'm assuming it's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.030 
Baton Pass head but I'm assuming it's
some<00:02:28.859> kind<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.069> supportive<00:02:29.579> set<00:02:29.790> though<00:02:31.040> once

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
some kind of supportive set though once

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.470 
some kind of supportive set though once
again<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.519> gonna<00:02:32.700> stay<00:02:32.939> in<00:02:32.969> I<00:02:33.329> don't

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
again I'm just gonna stay in I don't

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.539 
again I'm just gonna stay in I don't
know<00:02:33.599> what<00:02:33.750> he<00:02:33.810> wants<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.079> do<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.439> he<00:02:35.219> sets<00:02:35.459> up

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
know what he wants to do and he sets up

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.649 
know what he wants to do and he sets up
a<00:02:35.639> line<00:02:35.790> screen<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.180> kind<00:02:36.359> of<00:02:36.389> makes<00:02:36.569> me

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
a line screen which kind of makes me

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.179 
a line screen which kind of makes me
think<00:02:36.719> he<00:02:36.989> might<00:02:37.139> be<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> dual<00:02:37.530> screener<00:02:37.920> then

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
think he might be a dual screener then

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.220 
think he might be a dual screener then
again<00:02:38.430> he<00:02:38.879> has<00:02:39.000> no<00:02:39.209> light<00:02:39.480> clay<00:02:39.750> he<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:39.989> left

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
again he has no light clay he is left

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
again he has no light clay he is left
over<00:02:40.469> so<00:02:40.829> I<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.549> don't<00:02:41.730> know

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
over so I don't I don't know

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.839 
over so I don't I don't know
regardless<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.769> gonna<00:02:43.950> expect<00:02:44.430> him<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.700> set

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
regardless I'm gonna expect him to set

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.159 
regardless I'm gonna expect him to set
up<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.030> reflect<00:02:45.359> on<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> next<00:02:45.840> turn<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:45.989> what

duo really cover each other really well
but<00:03:18.209> yeah<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.900> gonna<00:03:18.989> go<00:03:19.079> for<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> toxic

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
but yeah so I'm gonna go for the toxic

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.619 
but yeah so I'm gonna go for the toxic
expecting<00:03:20.699> something<00:03:20.939> to<00:03:21.090> come<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.479> take

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
expecting something to come in to take

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.819 
expecting something to come in to take
the<00:03:21.750> earthquake<00:03:22.139> which<00:03:22.349> ends<00:03:22.530> up<00:03:22.560> being<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the earthquake which ends up being a

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.439 
the earthquake which ends up being a
gengar<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.400> case<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:23.970> immune<00:03:24.329> to

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
gengar in this case so that's immune to

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.539 
gengar in this case so that's immune to
toxic<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:24.930> well<00:03:25.229> as<00:03:25.470> earthquake<00:03:25.949> so<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.189> cannot

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
toxic as well as earthquake so I cannot

that is like some early diamond and

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.839 
that is like some early diamond and
pearl<00:03:40.379> stuff<00:03:40.650> right<00:03:40.829> there<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.340> haven't<00:03:41.699> seen

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
pearl stuff right there I haven't seen

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.619 
pearl stuff right there I haven't seen
that<00:03:42.000> since<00:03:42.180> since<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.859> old<00:03:44.069> days<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.540> he

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
that since since the old days and he

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.030 
that since since the old days and he
runs<00:03:45.810> both<00:03:46.049> beam<00:03:46.259> as<00:03:46.409> well<00:03:46.590> which<00:03:46.709> is<00:03:46.799> kind<00:03:46.919> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
runs both beam as well which is kind of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.249 
runs both beam as well which is kind of
funny<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:48.090> what<00:03:48.449> that<00:03:48.540> basically<00:03:48.750> tells<00:03:49.109> me

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
funny but what that basically tells me

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.589 
funny but what that basically tells me
is<00:03:49.379> that<00:03:49.409> he's<00:03:49.680> purely<00:03:50.129> offensive<00:03:50.579> no<00:03:51.000> sob<00:03:51.299> no

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
is that he's purely offensive no sob no

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.999 
is that he's purely offensive no sob no
pains<00:03:51.870> fled<00:03:52.139> nothing<00:03:52.439> like<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.709> which<00:03:52.919> is

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
pains fled nothing like that which is

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.740 
pains fled nothing like that which is

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
switch back to my Gliscor and I'm gonna

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.619 
switch back to my Gliscor and I'm gonna
take<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> hit<00:04:05.669> depending<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.239> what<00:04:06.419> he<00:04:06.479> does

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
take a hit depending on what he does

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.420 
take a hit depending on what he does
exactly<00:04:06.989> he's<00:04:07.259> gonna<00:04:07.379> I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:07.799> switch<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> up

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
exactly he's gonna I think switch it up

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.830 
exactly he's gonna I think switch it up
the<00:04:08.549> focus<00:04:08.879> blood<00:04:09.060> which<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.359> nice<00:04:09.569> play

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the focus blood which is a nice play

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.240 
the focus blood which is a nice play
because<00:04:10.139> in<00:04:10.229> this<00:04:10.349> case<00:04:10.530> he<00:04:10.709> hits<00:04:10.889> my<00:04:11.039> goal<00:04:11.159> of

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
because in this case he hits my goal of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.379 
because in this case he hits my goal of
square<00:04:11.400> instead<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.699> not<00:04:11.939> doing<00:04:12.090> anything

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
square instead of not doing anything

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.959 
square instead of not doing anything
with<00:04:12.629> t-bolt<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.250> guess<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.370> crit<00:04:14.639> that's<00:04:14.819> well

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
with t-bolt I guess the crit that's well

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.550 
with t-bolt I guess the crit that's well
which<00:04:15.120> really<00:04:15.299> doesn't<00:04:15.569> matter<00:04:15.659> and<00:04:15.959> I'm<00:04:16.440> just

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
which really doesn't matter and I'm just

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.870 
which really doesn't matter and I'm just
gonna<00:04:16.650> go<00:04:16.829> for<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.099> protect<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.579> kind<00:04:17.699> of<00:04:17.759> see

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
gonna go for to protect and kind of see

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.039 
gonna go for to protect and kind of see
what<00:04:18.000> he<00:04:18.060> wants<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.269> do<00:04:18.479> if<00:04:18.630> he<00:04:18.719> wants<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.930> go

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
what he wants to do if he wants to go

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.390 
what he wants to do if he wants to go
for<00:04:19.199> Shadow<00:04:19.409> Ball<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.739> don't<00:04:20.009> want<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.219> switch

I goes for the fire but surprisingly

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.850 
I goes for the fire but surprisingly
kills<00:06:06.330> me<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.540> was<00:06:06.780> kind<00:06:06.960> of<00:06:06.990> expecting<00:06:07.530> to<00:06:07.650> live

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860

that<00:06:08.130> but<00:06:08.900> guess<00:06:09.900> not<00:06:10.080> so<00:06:10.910> he<00:06:11.910> might<00:06:12.090> be<00:06:12.240> modest

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
that but guess not so he might be modest

that but guess not so he might be modest
now<00:06:12.780> that<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:12.990> think<00:06:13.050> about<00:06:13.290> it<00:06:13.530> because<00:06:13.590> that

thing<00:07:21.300> is<00:07:21.450> mu<00:07:21.900> has<00:07:22.080> the<00:07:22.200> exact<00:07:22.560> same<00:07:22.650> defenses

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
thing is mu has the exact same defenses

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.590 
thing is mu has the exact same defenses
I'm<00:07:23.400> assuming<00:07:23.790> they're<00:07:23.940> running<00:07:24.180> similar

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
I'm assuming they're running similar

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.170 
I'm assuming they're running similar
stress<00:07:24.930> as<00:07:25.110> well<00:07:25.290> both<00:07:26.070> max<00:07:26.340> HP<00:07:26.610> mu<00:07:26.880> in<00:07:27.060> this

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
stress as well both max HP mu in this

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.410 
stress as well both max HP mu in this
case<00:07:27.330> having<00:07:27.540> max<00:07:27.810> speed<00:07:28.640> so<00:07:29.640> why<00:07:30.030> would<00:07:30.300> this

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
case having max speed so why would this

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.930 
case having max speed so why would this
not<00:07:30.630> kill<00:07:30.960> right<00:07:31.320> but<00:07:31.590> it<00:07:31.680> doesn't<00:07:32.070> so<00:07:32.430> I<00:07:32.730> don't

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
not kill right but it doesn't so I don't

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.550 
not kill right but it doesn't so I don't
know<00:07:33.060> how<00:07:33.360> that<00:07:33.420> works<00:07:33.840> like<00:07:34.170> maybe<00:07:34.410> that<00:07:34.500> was

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
know how that works like maybe that was

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.320 
know how that works like maybe that was
minimum<00:07:35.010> damage<00:07:35.190> or<00:07:35.520> maybe<00:07:35.670> the<00:07:35.850> last<00:07:36.060> one<00:07:36.150> was

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.330 
minimum damage or maybe the last one was

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.570 
minimum damage or maybe the last one was
maximum<00:07:36.810> damage<00:07:36.960> or<00:07:37.200> maybe<00:07:37.380> I'm<00:07:37.860> just<00:07:38.280> talking

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580
