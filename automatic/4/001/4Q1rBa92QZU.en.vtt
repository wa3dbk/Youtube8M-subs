00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 youtube hello today we rise 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.160
 someone on a toresa canada dough 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.830
 buck 110 Kolosovsky set myself that all 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 four thermally half boss 30 27 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.029
 degrees he with their marker I paint 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.320
 this time did not choose a soul 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 resume because in my experience 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 no longer formed my 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 makes sense only on blades 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.580
 not quite typical forms here in principle 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.460
 everything is all so typical so long 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.489
 will work no problem with that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 no, the only moment that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.620
 would like to mention that we have here 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.110
 interesting for interesting as far as 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 in general, that may seem a rope 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 very powerful 30 millimeters very 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 tight and this is the geometry 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.039
 Yes, it is not exactly this rope 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 nevertheless wanted coverage here 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 very high quality I do not think that he 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.989
 will somehow impede the trainer therefore 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 maybe we see some unusual here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 at least some intrigue in this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:17.630
 testing is present and these go 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:17.630
 try not to delay says 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:40.899
 456 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:44.259
 and here is the first intrigue 710 and 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.530
 first indigo funny enough not 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.460
 knows and then it is important but the view is obvious 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.470
 absolutely that the blade length along with 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.990
 thick i pull down the art form for 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.140
 such a canada is not enough for a gun something 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.840
 gave the warrior mind costs quite obvious 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.610
 that grabs the knife studied on the china system 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.860
 6 x true about 37 role as already said in 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.739
 This is typical of this. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.750
 new see how the cut is going and it's like 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:25.829
 will not play for our try 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:25.829
 cut further we'll see 3 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:52.519
 4 5 6 10 here we have passed the traditional 20 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.440
 now we are less interrupting our viewers 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.950
 Vitim we return to the sauna ends 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.099
 lenovo 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.200
 and the audience who watches will praise 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.200
 single example very soon 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 so we return 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.930
 all the salt but we did put it you 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.440
 ride more 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.080
 why geometry is obvious that we have a cut 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.209
 it's pretty hard even 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.209
 go through a python rope several times 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.220
 can not fight so much so no 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:58.730
 less worth well in my opinion 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:58.730
 so look and be forth 4 5 6 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.480
 789 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.750
 here you know it's just very hard 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.440
 a dozen let's still try 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:43.280
 cut paper because you wear 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:49.820
 hard I do not know how to wait 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.530
 next you just cut a piece of paper with 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.380
 somehow 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.790
 calm man we have some 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.710
 degree of thorin situation with paris tank 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.930
 they show more interesting 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.790
 result 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:11.450
 finger and against it was also 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:14.240
 order for him was an article in theory and 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:20.990
 g10 most interesting m 154 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:25.970
 talk a little something in theory here there is 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:31.790
 places where it comes in here in life 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.910
 great place yes here there is a very place 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:42.800
 hard they pass just a little bit 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:45.470
 quite press 1010 20 I will cut Mozhaisk 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.410
 hard sober want to die like that 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.380
 radically nothing will change a 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:56.150
 now all four we see especially since 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.340
 and the most interesting that is pompon 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.130
 fought this can be useful for the forests 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.130
 Well, let's say that, and this is also my opinion 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:09.370
 worth it buck 110 and ring 1410 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.370
 cuts thanks viewing catch hire
