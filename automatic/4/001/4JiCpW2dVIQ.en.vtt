 welcome to gaming gaming 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.460

 and sincerely my name is jim and i am 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.050
 jordi and this is dirty ball 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.430
 I knew clearly we love him 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.350
 bang is a multiplayer first person 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.539
 shooter developed by the studio 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.700
 splash damage in the past they have 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.990
 very much multiplayer oriented 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.119
 things done so they have the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.429
 multiplayer made from wolves signed to 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.170
 three and batman arkham origins 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.179
 with this game they want the old one 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.740
 multiplayer glory of the nineties 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.000
 recover again but in one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.310
 modern jacket 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.810
 the game actually only knows fashion and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.700
 that is objectif 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.319
 You need a tank from an attacking team 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.929
 bring a to b and as much as possible 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.520
 to get there in the meantime 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.929
 also there is of course an opponent and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 he must defend this 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.950
 ensure that the opponent's technique 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 comes and they do that by turning everyone off 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.280
 killings in most of this kind 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.470
 drivers you have different classes 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.970
 you know it they score the first aid boxes 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.980
 throws another guy with a skirts 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.660
 lances duo pierce and and sharpener 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.760
 going to kempen nicely to put down bambi 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.280
 shooting in 13 bombs it became a little 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.140
 otherwise here you lure marx this 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.220
 are characters, each with their own 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.930
 attributes 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.060
 so he for example a female 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.519
 brand with a shotgun and first aid boxes 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.500
 but also one with a like rifle and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.000
 First aid boxes the fun of all these 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.010
 characters is that they are all one 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.350
 have different appearance have different voices 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.359
 and the variation doesn't stop there because 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.639
 each character can also be new 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.069
 weapons at get the game play from door 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.170
 that bomb is also very fast so look around 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.819
 are the corner you you're beautiful 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 kill a headshot anyway because a or 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.840
 another way another I also less 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.150
 sniper he is about to target you 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.620
 10 seconds you spawn again 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.389
 top we are going to save this 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.700
 you run towards your friends and yes 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.069

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.450

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.850

 please not just man teamwork 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 that's what the graphics are about 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.790
 I really like this game 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.900
 everything is in very bright colors 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.790
 in it has a very, very clean 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.769
 appearance and that proportions of all 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 characters are a bit exaggerated 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.669
 so even from great distances you can 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.590
 still recognize people is by that bon 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.209
 completely free and therefore you can do everything 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.920
 what we have not told ourselves 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.569
 by simply playing the game 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.519
 download and play 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.290

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.489
 why can you also buy the meurs 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.140
 we do not live social lives and we continue 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.150
 play until we have enough points 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.310
 by which we elicited all 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.480
 so we also play nice and greasy than we can 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.799

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.909
 this time you play like a new ss 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.310

 we are in an asian location anyway 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.460
 you can only ask one question 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.130
 about this game and that 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.530

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.289
