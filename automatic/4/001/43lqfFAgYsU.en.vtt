level set at about noon and with the
first<00:01:19.210> octave<00:01:19.720> level<00:01:20.020> turned<00:01:20.229> actually<00:01:20.680> to

first octave level turned actually to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.920 
first octave level turned actually to
its<00:01:20.979> maximum<00:01:21.490> value<00:01:21.520> we're<00:01:22.450> gonna<00:01:22.540> leave<00:01:22.780> this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
its maximum value we're gonna leave this

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.640 
its maximum value we're gonna leave this
on<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.430> octave<00:01:24.430> -<00:01:24.760> mode<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.840> operation<00:01:26.470> so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
on the octave - mode of operation so

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.140 
on the octave - mode of operation so
that<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:26.950> hear<00:01:27.130> what<00:01:27.310> octave<00:01:27.580> one<00:01:27.760> sounds

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
that you can hear what octave one sounds

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:51.600 
that you can hear what octave one sounds
like<00:01:28.270> by<00:01:28.479> itself

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.040 

and<00:01:52.610> now<00:01:52.790> what<00:01:52.940> I'll<00:01:53.030> do<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.210> I'll<00:01:53.510> simply<00:01:53.840> turn

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
and now what I'll do is I'll simply turn

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.560 
and now what I'll do is I'll simply turn
down<00:01:54.290> octave<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:55.040> -<00:01:55.370> its<00:01:55.580> minimum<00:01:56.000> value<00:01:56.060> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
down octave one - its minimum value and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.570 
down octave one - its minimum value and
turn<00:01:56.810> octave<00:01:57.229> -<00:01:57.440> Oh<00:01:57.470> up<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.860> its<00:01:58.040> maximum<00:01:58.220> value

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
turn octave - Oh up to its maximum value

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.210 
turn octave - Oh up to its maximum value
fans<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.630> hear<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.320> second<00:02:00.920> octave

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
fans so you can hear the second octave

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:25.420 
fans so you can hear the second octave
below<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.550> input<00:02:01.820> frequency<00:02:01.970> -<00:02:02.330> by<00:02:02.479> itself

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.640 

now<00:02:26.430> we're<00:02:26.550> gonna<00:02:26.640> try<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.330> drive<00:02:27.960> mode<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
now we're gonna try the drive mode of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.410 
now we're gonna try the drive mode of
operation<00:02:29.280> which<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:29.880> adds<00:02:30.270> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
operation which actually just adds a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.060 
operation which actually just adds a
little<00:02:30.660> bit<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.840> distortion<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.500> our<00:02:31.620> signal

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
little bit of distortion to our signal

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.180 
little bit of distortion to our signal
and<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> better<00:02:33.990> suited<00:02:34.410> for<00:02:34.620> an<00:02:34.860> aggressive

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and is a better suited for an aggressive

00:02:35.190 --> 00:03:04.449 
and is a better suited for an aggressive
sort<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.730> playing<00:02:35.910> style

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.410 

one<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.579> neat<00:03:05.730> things<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.269> with<00:03:06.390> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
one of the neat things you can do with a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.640 
one of the neat things you can do with a
pedal<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.049> oc3<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:08.030> generate<00:03:09.030> almost

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
pedal like the oc3 is generate almost

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.920 
pedal like the oc3 is generate almost

8-bit synthesizer type of sounds sort of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.059 
8-bit synthesizer type of sounds sort of
reminiscent<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.439> what<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.680> would<00:03:13.799> have<00:03:13.890> heard

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
reminiscent of what you would have heard

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.699 
reminiscent of what you would have heard
on<00:03:14.189> Nintendo<00:03:14.819> or<00:03:15.109> other<00:03:16.109> electronic

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
synthesizers in the 80s you can use this

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.379 
synthesizers in the 80s you can use this
for<00:03:19.620> basically<00:03:19.859> creating<00:03:20.700> sort<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.239> your

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
for basically creating sort of like your

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.550 
for basically creating sort of like your
