00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.240
 with the sugar until it turns 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240
 one part had 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:34.460
 It's a very liquid paste, I'm going 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.289
 then add the warm milk salt 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.299
 butter this butter has to be in 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:44.159
 room temperature 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:49.159
 now we're going to add three games 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.920
 slowly and at last we go 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.289
 add wheat or wheat you go 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.780
 adding to the little will not add 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.780
 at once stirring 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:11.099
 for the dough is a little on the net 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:14.069
 start then we are with the mass 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.170
 ready to have saved in the stone with 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.129
 this rest of wheat that I left 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.129
 separate 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:28.230
 Good now I'm just going to talk mass in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 stone and I am adding to the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.410
 remaining wheat 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.870
 now just cover and let the dough 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.269
 rest for about half an hour the screen 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.790
 double in size as we go 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.340
 to prepare the filling mix the jam 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.319
 the nuts and the drops of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.299
 chocolate and reserve 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.890
 I'm going to get this mass out of this ball. 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.890
 cut in various positions 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:07.300
 and we're going to pump into balls and we're going 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.330
 have this result here the mass goes 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.710
 about 30 balls like these 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.300
 and then there is how we will 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.870
 stuff these polka dots now 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.080
 so we'll get each ball to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.710
 open in the palm of your hand and 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.010
 filling and then close again 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.500
 It's very easy of the story. It 's like I 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.100
 would have made a coxinha 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.990
 I put some stuffing in the center 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.610
 this mafia 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:43.090
 I'll pull and I'll close having the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.640
 careful not to let the stuffing come out 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.150
 following in the butter and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.800
 cinnamon sugar mixture and grated coconut 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.990
 place in the greased mold that can be 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.300
 window or else it's panettone 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.030
 the balls are placed in layers and 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.520
 fill the space a few drops of 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.650
 chocolate to decorate and bake the 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.709
 200 and 30 degrees for 40 minutes 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.170
 and now it's time to make the syrup that does not 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.629
 secret has just put water and 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.790
 to boil and then pour 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.299
 above the mass which must also be 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.280
 hot this syrup will leave the thread 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.930
 more humid 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.539
 she has is hot with the hot syrup 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.150

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.370
 suck all this cause wait cool 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.919

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.900
 decorate with chocolate drops and the thread 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.169
