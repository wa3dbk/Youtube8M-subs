00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
but it fits it doesn't I mean it doesn't

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.460 
but it fits it doesn't I mean it doesn't
pull<00:03:55.100> out<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.840> if<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.350> hadn't<00:03:57.590> screw<00:03:57.830> it

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
comes out so I guess if you screw it in

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.460 
comes out so I guess if you screw it in
too<00:04:13.820> far<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:15.400> but<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:18.140> alright

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
