and I think they made it pretty good I
haven't<00:02:23.420> maybe<00:02:24.050> battlefield<00:02:25.720> play4free<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.880> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
haven't maybe battlefield play4free is a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.200 
haven't maybe battlefield play4free is a
bit<00:02:29.210> better<00:02:29.420> but<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.740> like<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.430> customization

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
bit better but I like this customization

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
thing and you can change your loadout so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.690 
thing and you can change your loadout so
it's<00:02:35.930> kind<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.410> Call<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> Duty<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.450> and

which wasn't the case obviously my my

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.249 
which wasn't the case obviously my my
few<00:05:27.930> tries<00:05:28.289> or<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.520> book<00:05:29.669> you<00:05:29.849> baby<00:05:30.089> oh<00:05:30.330> you

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
see his pawn god damn you spawn the

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.420 
see his pawn god damn you spawn the
spawn<00:05:35.669> they<00:05:36.479> spawned<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:37.050> right<00:05:37.620> right<00:05:37.919> in

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
spawn they spawned like right right in

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.339 
spawn they spawned like right right in
front<00:05:38.729> of<00:05:38.819> me<00:05:39.029> right<00:05:39.659> behind<00:05:40.500> me<00:05:41.599> well<00:05:42.599> I<00:05:42.899> think

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
front of me right behind me well I think

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.059 
front of me right behind me well I think
this<00:05:43.710> game<00:05:43.949> can<00:05:44.599> get<00:05:45.599> some<00:05:45.810> better<00:05:45.960> spawns<00:05:46.379> but

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
this game can get some better spawns but

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.249 
this game can get some better spawns but
apart<00:05:47.550> from<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:47.819> I<00:05:48.240> think<00:05:48.300> it's<00:05:48.689> a<00:05:48.870> beast

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
apart from that I think it's a beast

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.769 
apart from that I think it's a beast
game<00:05:49.819> especially<00:05:50.819> for<00:05:51.270> play<00:05:51.949> for<00:05:52.949> free<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:53.779> I

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
game especially for play for free and I

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.959 
game especially for play for free and I
think<00:05:54.839> everyone<00:05:55.560> should<00:05:55.589> try<00:05:56.069> it<00:05:56.189> out<00:05:56.460> give<00:05:56.849> it

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
think everyone should try it out give it

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:02.719 
think everyone should try it out give it
give<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:58.020> try<00:05:58.580> because<00:05:59.580> I<00:06:01.339> think<00:06:02.339> it

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
give it a try because I think it

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.329 
give it a try because I think it
deserves<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:03.749> it's<00:06:04.379> a<00:06:04.529> good<00:06:04.740> game<00:06:05.149> so<00:06:06.289> if

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:07.339 
deserves it and it's a good game so if

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:13.040 
deserves it and it's a good game so if
you<00:06:08.339> don't<00:06:08.849> have<00:06:09.469> like<00:06:10.819> enough<00:06:11.819> money<00:06:12.240> saved<00:06:12.569> I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
you don't have like enough money saved I

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.670 
you don't have like enough money saved I
