where<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.240> meet<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:35.380> glue<00:02:35.620> this

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
where they meet and then glue this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.420 
where they meet and then glue this
together<00:02:36.100> with<00:02:36.310> hot<00:02:36.459> glue<00:02:37.740> okay<00:02:38.770> here's<00:02:39.130> what

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
together with hot glue okay here's what

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.840 
together with hot glue okay here's what
the<00:02:39.760> cup<00:02:40.390> should<00:02:40.570> look<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.610> see

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
the cup should look like now you can see

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.030 
the cup should look like now you can see
this<00:02:43.060> line<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.450> I've<00:02:43.600> made<00:02:43.750> inside<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.530> when

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
this line that I've made inside and when

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
this line that I've made inside and when
you<00:02:45.160> take<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.570> line<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.900> right

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
you take this out the line is right

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.930 
you take this out the line is right
there<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.770> doesn't<00:02:48.040> match<00:02:48.190> up<00:02:48.430> exactly

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
there and it doesn't match up exactly

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.600 
there and it doesn't match up exactly
with<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> seam<00:02:49.930> depending<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.160> brand<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
with the seam depending on the brand of

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.070 
with the seam depending on the brand of
cup<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.970> you're<00:02:52.090> using<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.600> might<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:53.050> a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
cup that you're using this might be a

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.440 
cup that you're using this might be a
little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.890> cup<00:02:54.730> may<00:02:54.880> need<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.270> made<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
little bit the cup may need to be made a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.850 
little bit the cup may need to be made a
little<00:02:55.660> bit<00:02:55.870> larger<00:02:56.260> or<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.740> bit

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
little bit larger or a little bit

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.620 
little bit larger or a little bit
smaller<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.850> we're<00:02:58.030> gonna<00:02:58.120> line<00:02:58.390> these<00:02:58.570> up

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
smaller but we're gonna line these up

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.540 
smaller but we're gonna line these up
and<00:02:59.110> use<00:02:59.530> hot<00:02:59.770> glue<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.040> glue<00:03:00.280> them<00:03:00.490> together

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
and use hot glue to glue them together

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.340 
and use hot glue to glue them together
okay<00:03:03.550> here's<00:03:03.760> where<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.180> coffee<00:03:04.840> sleeve

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
okay here's where the coffee sleeve

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.759 
okay here's where the coffee sleeve
comes<00:03:05.800> into<00:03:06.160> play<00:03:06.959> put<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.050> onto<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.350> larger

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
comes into play put it onto the larger

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.050 
comes into play put it onto the larger
cup<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.160> one<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.489> cut<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.700> hole<00:03:09.760> in

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
cup the one that you cut a hole in

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.150 
cup the one that you cut a hole in
earlier<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.600> make<00:03:11.350> sure<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:11.860> slide

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
earlier and make sure that it can slide

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.850 
earlier and make sure that it can slide
freely<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.720> does<00:03:14.019> not<00:03:14.170> obstruct<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.680> hole

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
freely and does not obstruct the hole

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.120 
freely and does not obstruct the hole
this<00:03:15.100> sliding<00:03:15.580> motion<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.180> key<00:03:16.920> that's<00:03:17.920> how

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
this sliding motion is key that's how

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.060 
this sliding motion is key that's how
you<00:03:18.190> will<00:03:18.519> release<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.090> candy<00:03:19.450> later<00:03:19.630> and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
you will release the candy later and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.040 
you will release the candy later and
we're<00:03:21.070> going<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.370> measure<00:03:21.640> about<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.660> inch

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
we're going to measure about an inch

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.009 
we're going to measure about an inch
I'll<00:03:23.530> approximate<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.430> with<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> ruler<00:03:25.019> put

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
I'll approximate this with a ruler put

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.800 
I'll approximate this with a ruler put
the<00:03:26.650> other<00:03:26.800> cup<00:03:27.070> next<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.640> these<00:03:28.390> are<00:03:28.630> about

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the other cup next to it these are about

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.759 
the other cup next to it these are about
an<00:03:28.989> inch<00:03:29.200> down<00:03:29.440> from<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.800> top<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
an inch down from the top of the

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.940 
an inch down from the top of the
insulating<00:03:32.769> sleeve<00:03:33.390> mark<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.920> know

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
insulating sleeve mark it just you know

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.210 
insulating sleeve mark it just you know
with<00:03:36.160> your<00:03:36.310> finger<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.870> then<00:03:38.040> we<00:03:39.040> measure

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
with your finger and then we measure

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.280 
with your finger and then we measure
across<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.090> comes<00:03:40.390> on<00:03:40.690> line<00:03:40.930> down<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
across and that comes on line down to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.009 
across and that comes on line down to
the<00:03:41.530> bottom<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.980> syrup<00:03:42.280> line<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:43.019> from

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
the bottom of the syrup line and from

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.620 
the bottom of the syrup line and from
the<00:03:44.170> bottom<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.709> line<00:03:44.950> I've<00:03:45.549> made<00:03:45.850> two

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
the bottom of that line I've made two

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.890 
the bottom of that line I've made two
parallel<00:03:47.260> lines<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.060> down<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.450> this

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
parallel lines going up and down on this

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
parallel lines going up and down on this
cup<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.440> we're<00:03:50.709> gonna<00:03:50.799> cut<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.340> big<00:03:51.700> tab<00:03:52.090> out

it's<00:04:54.290> kind<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.620> hard<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.890> see<00:04:55.780> right<00:04:56.780> here

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
it's kind of hard to see right here

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.560 
it's kind of hard to see right here
where<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.940> fold<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.900> for<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.300> slit<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.450> we

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
where that fold is for that slit that we

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.950 
where that fold is for that slit that we
cut<00:05:02.780> out<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.230> smaller<00:05:03.590> cup<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.960> it's

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
cut out of the smaller cup and it's

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.630 
cut out of the smaller cup and it's
important<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.620> keep<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.980> slit<00:05:07.370> there

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
important that you keep that slit there

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.710 
important that you keep that slit there
okay<00:05:08.740> don't<00:05:09.740> cut<00:05:09.950> that<00:05:10.070> off<00:05:13.390> afterwards<00:05:14.390> you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
okay don't cut that off afterwards you

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.120 
okay don't cut that off afterwards you
have<00:05:14.750> to<00:05:14.990> decide<00:05:15.320> which<00:05:15.530> way<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.770> want<00:05:15.890> to

matter<00:05:18.470> which<00:05:18.710> way<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.870> turn<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:22.300> I'm<00:05:23.300> gonna

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
matter which way and turn this I'm gonna

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.810 
matter which way and turn this I'm gonna
go<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.930> way<00:05:24.970> and<00:05:25.970> just<00:05:26.450> keep<00:05:26.720> turning<00:05:27.020> until

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
go this way and just keep turning until

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.219 
go this way and just keep turning until
it's<00:05:28.820> closed<00:05:29.919> like<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.729> now<00:05:32.690> we're

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
it's closed like that and now we're

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.719 
it's closed like that and now we're
gonna<00:05:33.350> once<00:05:33.620> again<00:05:33.890> go<00:05:34.070> into<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.340> inside<00:05:34.610> of

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
gonna once again go into the inside of

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.280 
gonna once again go into the inside of
the<00:05:34.820> cup<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.300> take<00:05:36.290> with<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.530> pencil<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:38.290> Mark

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
the cup and take with a pencil and Mark

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.840 
the cup and take with a pencil and Mark
on<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.890> inside<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.880> we're<00:05:41.030> gonna<00:05:41.120> cut<00:05:41.510> a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
on the inside and we're gonna cut a

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.790 
on the inside and we're gonna cut a
small<00:05:43.850> slit<00:05:44.150> through<00:05:44.990> those<00:05:45.140> two<00:05:45.350> lines<00:05:45.560> and

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
small slit through those two lines and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.920 
small slit through those two lines and
then<00:05:45.950> some<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.550> then<00:05:47.180> once<00:05:47.390> again<00:05:47.540> right

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
then some and then once again right

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.750 
then some and then once again right
above<00:05:48.169> them<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.650> get<00:05:48.770> a<00:05:48.800> very<00:05:48.890> small

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
above them so you get a very small

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.870 
above them so you get a very small
pinhole<00:05:50.800> what<00:05:51.800> we're<00:05:51.919> going<00:05:52.100> to<00:05:52.160> do<00:05:52.340> now<00:05:52.550> is

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
pinhole what we're going to do now is

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.900 
pinhole what we're going to do now is
take<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.450> bottom<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:54.050> a<00:05:54.380> scrap<00:05:54.770> square<00:05:55.250> from

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
take the bottom and a scrap square from

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.450 
take the bottom and a scrap square from
when<00:05:56.240> we<00:05:56.390> cut<00:05:56.600> out<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.080> holes<00:05:57.919> in<00:05:58.100> this<00:05:58.220> sides

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
when we cut out the holes in this sides

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.610 
when we cut out the holes in this sides
of<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.729> cup<00:05:58.910> and<00:05:59.150> you're<00:05:59.990> gonna<00:06:00.110> fold<00:06:00.410> the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
of the cup and you're gonna fold the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.930 
of the cup and you're gonna fold the
square<00:06:00.860> over<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:01.820> you<00:06:01.940> get<00:06:02.090> like<00:06:02.240> an<00:06:02.450> L<00:06:02.660> shape

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
square over so you get like an L shape

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.659 
square over so you get like an L shape
then<00:06:04.940> using<00:06:05.720> hot<00:06:05.930> glue<00:06:06.190> we're<00:06:07.190> going<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> glue

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
then using hot glue we're going to glue

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.060 
then using hot glue we're going to glue
one<00:06:08.330> side<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.840> L<00:06:08.960> shape<00:06:09.700> to<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:12.680> circle

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
one side of the L shape to the circle

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.719 
one side of the L shape to the circle
then<00:06:13.310> we're<00:06:14.090> going<00:06:14.270> to<00:06:14.479> take<00:06:14.870> this<00:06:15.169> and

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
then we're going to take this and

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.469 
then we're going to take this and
angling<00:06:16.729> this<00:06:16.880> downwards

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
angling this downwards

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.200 
angling this downwards
we<00:06:18.990> put<00:06:19.229> the<00:06:19.699> attachment<00:06:20.699> flap<00:06:20.939> on<00:06:21.120> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
we put the attachment flap on the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.140 
we put the attachment flap on the
opposite<00:06:21.719> side<00:06:22.020> of<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.469> square<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.009> we<00:06:23.849> angle

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
opposite side of the square and we angle

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.409 
opposite side of the square and we angle
it<00:06:24.270> downwards<00:06:24.809> so<00:06:25.379> that<00:06:25.849> the<00:06:26.849> candy<00:06:27.330> is

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419
