how<00:00:30.280> dogs<00:00:30.580> communicate<00:00:31.270> they<00:00:31.840> use<00:00:32.050> all<00:00:32.349> of

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
how dogs communicate they use all of

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.490 
how dogs communicate they use all of
their<00:00:32.770> senses<00:00:33.280> including<00:00:33.460> touch<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:35.230> much

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
their senses including touch and so much

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.930 
their senses including touch and so much
of<00:00:35.530> their<00:00:35.800> information<00:00:36.070> comes<00:00:36.580> through<00:00:36.700> there

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
of their information comes through there

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
of their information comes through there
a<00:00:36.970> factory<00:00:37.480> system<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:38.140> also<00:00:38.590> through<00:00:38.980> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
a factory system and also through a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.570 
a factory system and also through a
vocalization<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.260> can<00:00:41.440> misunderstand<00:00:41.830> or

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
vocalization so we can misunderstand or

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.369 
vocalization so we can misunderstand or
we're<00:00:42.879> just<00:00:42.910> not<00:00:43.210> privy<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.809> lot<00:00:43.900> of<00:00:44.140> their

with and when to walk away from a

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.650 
with and when to walk away from a
situation<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.640> most<00:02:46.820> important<00:02:47.300> thing<00:02:47.450> is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
situation the most important thing is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.120 
situation the most important thing is
always<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.410> positive<00:02:48.770> experience

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
always that it's a positive experience

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.430 
always that it's a positive experience
so<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.180> work<00:02:50.360> at<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.570> paste<00:02:50.810> excited<00:02:51.290> by<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
client dog so we take things as slowly

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.660 
client dog so we take things as slowly
as<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.050> need<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.530> things<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.580> be

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.410 
done safely and in a controlled way but
the<00:02:57.500> main<00:02:57.680> thing<00:02:57.710> for<00:02:58.160> all<00:02:58.490> interactions<00:02:59.270> is

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the main thing for all interactions is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.790 
the main thing for all interactions is
that<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.020> interaction<00:03:00.380> has<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:00.770> a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
that the interaction has to be a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.650 
that the interaction has to be a
learning<00:03:00.980> experience<00:03:01.190> Eve<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.210> positive

from the other dog is to respond by

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
signal back the interaction can then

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.820 
signal back the interaction can then
reduce<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> safer<00:03:32.090> level<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.110> here<00:03:33.380> Swift
