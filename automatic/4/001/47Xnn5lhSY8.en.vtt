00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
pattern for this entire part but at the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.590 
pattern for this entire part but at the
very<00:01:21.040> last<00:01:21.280> when<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:21.670> play<00:01:21.880> this<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.270> chord

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
very last when I play this a chord

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.630 
very last when I play this a chord
you'll<00:01:22.810> play<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.110> three<00:01:23.380> times<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.460> you'll

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
you'll play it three times and you'll

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.870 
you'll play it three times and you'll
play<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.880> C<00:01:25.180> chord<00:01:25.510> three<00:01:25.780> times<00:01:26.050> as<00:01:26.260> well<00:01:26.880> so

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
play the C chord three times as well so

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.670 
play the C chord three times as well so
you're<00:01:28.090> not<00:01:28.210> going<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.600> count<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.080> five<00:01:29.380> and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
you're not going to count to five and

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.910 
you're not going to count to five and
then<00:01:29.770> one<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.120> will<00:01:31.270> be<00:01:31.420> one<00:01:31.570> two<00:01:31.750> three

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

one two three

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.120 
one two three
so<00:01:34.360> let's<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.110> slow<00:01:35.320> motion<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:35.950> it's

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
so let's do this in slow motion so it's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.510 
so let's do this in slow motion so it's
one<00:01:36.550> two<00:01:37.050> three<00:01:38.050> four<00:01:38.560> five<00:01:39.340> six<00:01:40.180> one<00:01:40.600> two

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

one two three four five six one two
three<00:01:42.520> four<00:01:43.030> five<00:01:43.750> six<00:01:44.650> one<00:01:45.100> two<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:47.470> four

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
three four five six one two three four

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.500 
three four five six one two three four
six<00:01:49.580> one<00:01:50.450> two<00:01:51.200> three<00:01:52.210> one<00:01:53.210> two<00:01:53.240> three<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:56.330> now

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
six one two three one two three so now

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.580 
six one two three one two three so now
I'm<00:01:56.600> going<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.870> play<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:57.260> more<00:01:57.320> time

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
I'm going to play it one more time

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:18.729 
I'm going to play it one more time
slowly<00:01:57.920> without<00:01:58.310> me<00:01:58.490> talking

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.880 

okay<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.890> next<00:02:20.010> part

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.340 

you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.410 

so<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.500> left<00:02:36.650> hand<00:02:36.740> plays<00:02:37.010> an<00:02:37.160> average<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.850> G

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
so the left hand plays an average of a G

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.920 
so the left hand plays an average of a G
octave<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.620> nay<00:02:39.740> octave

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
octave and the nay octave

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.490 
octave and the nay octave
I<00:02:40.959> see<00:02:41.920> octave<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.670> knee<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.909> to<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I see octave and the knee up to the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.259 
I see octave and the knee up to the
right<00:02:44.709> hand<00:02:44.920> apply<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> CF<00:02:47.340> bdg<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.780> c<00:02:49.780> e<00:02:50.379> g<00:02:51.239> c<00:02:52.239> e

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
right hand apply a CF bdg a c e g c e

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:07.400 
right hand apply a CF bdg a c e g c e
and<00:02:53.140> g<00:02:53.400> b<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.209> how<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.689> play<00:02:58.900> them

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.440 

you<00:03:08.040> played<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.180> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you played like this and what you do is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.600 
you played like this and what you do is
you<00:03:09.900> play<00:03:10.820> still<00:03:12.170> six<00:03:13.170> counts<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.490> do

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
you play still six counts so what you do

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.290 
you play still six counts so what you do
is<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.850> count<00:03:15.290> six<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> first<00:03:16.920> chord<00:03:17.300> on

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
is you count six on the first chord on

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.720 
is you count six on the first chord on
this<00:03:18.510> F<00:03:18.690> chord<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.740> three<00:03:20.160> more

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
this F chord and then three more

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.220 
this F chord and then three more
so<00:03:21.270> basically<00:03:21.660> nine<00:03:22.020> then<00:03:23.630> three<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.930> one

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so basically nine then three on this one

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.440 
so basically nine then three on this one
and<00:03:25.520> then<00:03:26.840> three<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.050> this<00:03:28.230> one<00:03:29.180> free<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.300> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
and then three on this one free on this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.600 
and then three on this one free on this
one<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:32.220> six<00:03:32.550> on<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.340> nine

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
one and six on this one so it's nine

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.890 
one and six on this one so it's nine
three<00:03:36.030> three<00:03:36.060> three<00:03:36.950> six<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:39.180> let's<00:03:39.390> do<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
