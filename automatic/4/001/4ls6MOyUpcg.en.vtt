00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
photosphere boss well came out with a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840 
photosphere boss well came out with a
good<00:00:19.170> way<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.789> very

quick and also very accurate so you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
quick and also very accurate so you
don't<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> lot<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.430> weird<00:00:23.820> type<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
don't get a lot of weird type of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630 
don't get a lot of weird type of
artifacts<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> image<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.460> going

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
artifacts in the image so what I'm going

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.750 
artifacts in the image so what I'm going
to<00:00:26.699> show<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:26.970> right<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.560> nice<00:00:29.070> dizzying

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to show you right now is a nice dizzying

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.540 
to show you right now is a nice dizzying
effect<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.740> motion<00:00:31.920> sickness<00:00:32.250> this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
effect you get motion sickness this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
effect you get motion sickness this
might<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> best<00:00:33.360> way<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
might not be the best way for you to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
might not be the best way for you to
make<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> photosphere<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> probably

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
make a photosphere but this is probably

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.900 
make a photosphere but this is probably
the<00:00:36.450> best<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> need<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.730> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the best way so what you need to do is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
the best way so what you need to do is
actually<00:00:39.059> keep<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.450> arms<00:00:39.719> close<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
actually keep your arms close to your

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.170 
actually keep your arms close to your
body<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> hold<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
body if you want to hold it up and it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
body if you want to hold it up and it's
going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> say<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> line<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.079> start<00:00:43.460> now<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to say a line to start now the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to say a line to start now the
idea<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.390> move<00:00:45.629> around<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.260> camera<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
idea is to move around the camera so you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860 
idea is to move around the camera so you
that<00:00:47.340> you're<00:00:47.460> only<00:00:47.579> pivoting<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.239> hand<00:00:48.719> up

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that you're only pivoting your hand up

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
that you're only pivoting your hand up
and<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and down what you don't want to do is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
and down what you don't want to do is
start<00:00:50.940> moving<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.360> arms<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:51.930> like

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
start moving your arms up and down like

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
start moving your arms up and down like
this<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.160> will<00:00:53.309> definitely<00:00:53.460> be

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this because then you will definitely be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
this because then you will definitely be
getting<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.329> artifacts<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
getting some artifacts so we're going to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
getting some artifacts so we're going to
do<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.190> stay<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.610> exact<00:00:57.059> same<00:00:57.300> circle

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
do is stay in this exact same circle

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
do is stay in this exact same circle
plane<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.739> gonna<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.070> around<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> globe

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
plane we're gonna go around like a globe

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
plane we're gonna go around like a globe
and<00:01:00.059> complete<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.750> pretty<00:01:01.079> much<00:01:01.289> middle<00:01:01.590> top

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and complete this pretty much middle top

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
and complete this pretty much middle top
to<00:01:02.309> bottom<00:01:02.460> since<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.480> bright<00:01:03.690> out

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to bottom since it's also bright out

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.390 
to bottom since it's also bright out
here<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> able<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
here we're going to be able to do this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
here we're going to be able to do this
very<00:01:05.489> quickly<00:01:05.820> around<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> circle<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
very quickly around in a circle if it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
very quickly around in a circle if it
were<00:01:07.619> dark<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.040> exposure<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.210> know

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
were dark for the exposure time you know

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.730 
were dark for the exposure time you know
it<00:01:09.390> would<00:01:09.479> take<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> lot<00:01:09.810> longer<00:01:09.990> did<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> taking

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it would take a lot longer did it taking

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:22.600 
it would take a lot longer did it taking
a<00:01:10.770> picture<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.090> go

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.890 

returning<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:23.790> reference<00:01:24.240> point<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.720> my

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
returning to my reference point and my

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
returning to my reference point and my
cameraman<00:01:25.500> yes<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:25.950> gonna<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.250> seeing<00:01:26.490> the

like<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.700> complete<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> circle<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
like this and complete the circle you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330 
like this and complete the circle you
can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.560> blue<00:01:31.770> dots<00:01:32.009> are

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
can see the little blue dots are

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.260 
can see the little blue dots are
following<00:01:32.700> around<00:01:32.970> perfectly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.370 

and<00:01:37.270> again<00:01:37.510> give<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.110> upward<00:01:42.870> it's<00:01:43.870> also<00:01:44.050> nice

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
and again give it upward it's also nice

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.050 
and again give it upward it's also nice
is<00:01:44.590> because<00:01:44.620> I'm<00:01:44.980> pivoting<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.520> way<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:45.970> not

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
is because I'm pivoting this way and not

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.700 
is because I'm pivoting this way and not
going<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.570> seeing<00:01:46.810> any<00:01:47.020> holes<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
going to be seeing any holes in the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.460 
going to be seeing any holes in the
image<00:01:47.950> take<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.090> downward<00:01:49.510> start

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
image take it to the downward start

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.910 
image take it to the downward start
completing<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.890> lower<00:01:51.070> part<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.520> your<00:01:51.670> spear
