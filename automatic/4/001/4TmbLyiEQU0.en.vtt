00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
hearing her thoughts as well I there are

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.460 
hearing her thoughts as well I there are
issues<00:05:18.730> with<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.240> line<00:05:19.480> for<00:05:19.510> example<00:05:20.320> the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
issues with this line for example the

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.590 
issues with this line for example the
deluxe<00:05:20.770> body<00:05:21.040> which<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.550> just<00:05:21.940> personally

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
deluxe body which I just personally

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.150 
deluxe body which I just personally
think<00:05:22.990> they<00:05:23.170> could<00:05:23.320> have<00:05:23.440> put<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.680> little<00:05:23.920> more

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
think they could have put a little more

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.400 
think they could have put a little more
effort<00:05:24.310> into<00:05:24.750> it's<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> little<00:05:26.050> loosey-goosey

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
effort into it's a little loosey-goosey

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.250 
effort into it's a little loosey-goosey
at<00:05:26.860> times<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:28.000> don't<00:05:28.300> like<00:05:28.420> that<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.990> arms

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
at times and I don't like that the arms

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.770 
at times and I don't like that the arms
hyperextend<00:05:30.040> as<00:05:30.160> much<00:05:30.310> as<00:05:30.490> they<00:05:30.640> do<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:31.390> is<00:05:31.750> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
hyperextend as much as they do it is a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.270 
hyperextend as much as they do it is a
little<00:05:32.080> awkward<00:05:32.200> when<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.710> shoe<00:05:32.860> falls<00:05:33.070> off

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
little awkward when the shoe falls off

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.610 
little awkward when the shoe falls off
because<00:05:33.700> of<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:33.880> peg<00:05:34.060> leg<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.570> don't<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.290> that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
