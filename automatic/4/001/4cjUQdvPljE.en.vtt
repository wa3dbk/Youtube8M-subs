00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
by having returning starter Matt Johns a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
by having returning starter Matt Johns a
quarterback<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.619> you're<00:01:10.770> looking<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.280> Matt

still<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.150> dumb<00:01:18.420> mistakes<00:01:18.930> but

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
still make some dumb mistakes but

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.490 
still make some dumb mistakes but
they're<00:01:19.740> getting<00:01:19.890> fewer<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.340> fewer<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.500> you
