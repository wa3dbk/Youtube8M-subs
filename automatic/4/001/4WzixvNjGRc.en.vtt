00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.250 
is easy to move with very freely it's
not<00:03:19.350> very<00:03:19.620> large<00:03:20.240> there<00:03:21.240> was<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.600> pop<00:03:22.080> filter

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
not very large there was a pop filter

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.470 
not very large there was a pop filter
that<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.590> tried<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.340> was<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.520> mesh<00:03:23.880> metal

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that I tried out it was a mesh metal

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
that I tried out it was a mesh metal
screen<00:03:24.990> didn't<00:03:25.920> really<00:03:26.100> care<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.490> and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
screen didn't really care for that and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.760 
screen didn't really care for that and
it<00:03:26.760> was<00:03:26.820> heavier<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.200> very<00:03:28.440> light

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
it was heavier this is very light

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.060 
it was heavier this is very light
because<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.760> made<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.060> mesh<00:03:30.330> um<00:03:30.870> feels<00:03:31.830> kind

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
because it's made of mesh um feels kind

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.760 
because it's made of mesh um feels kind
of<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.280> nylons<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:33.060> pantyhose<00:03:33.390> maybe<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.560> it

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
of like nylons or pantyhose maybe but it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.830 
of like nylons or pantyhose maybe but it
does<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.160> trick<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.910> diffuse<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.540> sound

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
does the trick to diffuse the sound

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.880 
does the trick to diffuse the sound
between<00:03:37.700> your<00:03:38.700> mouth<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.350> microphone<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.830> it

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
between your mouth and microphone so it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.790 
between your mouth and microphone so it
does<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.490> under<00:03:42.450> 20<00:03:42.750> bucks<00:03:42.960> I'll<00:03:43.200> share

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
does just that under 20 bucks I'll share

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.620
