it's it's great for all around riding if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's it's great for all around riding if
we<00:01:13.830> flip<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.170> see<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> basis<00:01:16.680> here

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
we flip it over and see the basis here

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
we flip it over and see the basis here
these<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.520> base<00:01:17.790> options<00:01:18.330> these<00:01:18.990> are

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
these are the two base options these are

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
these are the two base options these are
full<00:01:19.409> sublimated<00:01:20.100> basis<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.720> all

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
full sublimated basis so you can see all

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
full sublimated basis so you can see all
those<00:01:21.990> different<00:01:22.229> colors<00:01:22.650> they're<00:01:23.150> really

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
those different colors they're really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
those different colors they're really
gives<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> cool<00:01:24.930> prism<00:01:25.439> vibe<00:01:26.030> not

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
gives it a kind of cool prism vibe not

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.100 
gives it a kind of cool prism vibe not
prison<00:01:27.450> vibe<00:01:27.659> prism<00:01:28.560> vibe<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> see

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
prison vibe prism vibe and then you see

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
prison vibe prism vibe and then you see
the<00:01:31.229> alternate<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the alternate here with the kind of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.950 
the alternate here with the kind of
reverse<00:01:32.880> color<00:01:33.150> scheme<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
reverse color scheme so you see the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
reverse color scheme so you see the
colors<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.619> beacon<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.800 
all Mountain core which is our poplar
core<00:01:55.810> very<00:01:56.810> lightweight<00:01:57.080> very<00:01:57.530> strong<00:01:58.810> again

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
core very lightweight very strong again

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.450 
core very lightweight very strong again
with<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.050> tapered<00:02:00.440> tip<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:00.830> tail<00:02:00.980> so<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.370> get

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
with the tapered tip and tail so you get

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.950 
with the tapered tip and tail so you get
a<00:02:01.520> little<00:02:01.700> bit<00:02:01.910> more<00:02:02.090> play<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.630> tip<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
a little bit more play on the tip and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.500 
a little bit more play on the tip and
tail<00:02:03.190> with<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> thicker<00:02:04.580> base<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.360> had<00:02:05.450> a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
tail with a thicker base so you had a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.970 
tail with a thicker base so you had a
little<00:02:05.660> bit<00:02:05.810> more<00:02:05.930> strength<00:02:06.290> think<00:02:06.830> this

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
little bit more strength think this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.530 
little bit more strength think this
board<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.250> my<00:02:07.370> favorite<00:02:07.760> just<00:02:08.030> because<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.420> its

board is my favorite just because of its

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.650 
board is my favorite just because of its
versatility<00:02:09.520> knowing<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.550> if<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.480> going

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
versatility knowing that if it's going

be<00:02:42.080> able<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.410> transition<00:02:42.770> really<00:02:43.190> really

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
be able to transition really really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.220 
be able to transition really really
smoothly<00:02:43.670> because<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.420> wave<00:02:44.989> link

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
smoothly because of that wave link

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800 
smoothly because of that wave link
technology<00:02:45.860> with<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.910> regular<00:02:47.330> camber<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
technology with the regular camber and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.310 
technology with the regular camber and
the<00:02:47.930> rocker<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.540> had<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.930> take<00:02:51.110> one

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
the rocker and if you had to take one

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.620 
the rocker and if you had to take one
board<00:02:51.590> anywhere<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.220> think<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.330> board

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
board anywhere I think this is the board

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.510 
board anywhere I think this is the board
to<00:02:53.720> take<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.620> because<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.250> give

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520
