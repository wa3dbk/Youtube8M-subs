00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.690
 karim you are gone to the elysée for 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.609
 ask his opinion at the first of 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.980
 french françois hollande that all this 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.660
 that he has to say one halfway to this 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.670
 world cup the blue ones are qualified 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.110
 how do you want to judge these blues is this 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.230
 that it's already won for them 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.090
 sportingly and in terms of image 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.829
 I know French well I know 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 their enthusiasm sometimes also their 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.970
 way of denigrating what may have been a 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.210
 loved time so it's not because the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.420
 match against the equator was not at the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.270
 height of what it could have been between the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.770
 Swiss that we need where we 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.210
 to be excited to consider that we are 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.700
 already win the world cup or 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.930
 consider that they have already lost 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.030
 because we only made a draw 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.410
 against the equator me I support 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.720
 the France team when we support 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.910
 the team of France we do not look at this or 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.770
 such match we do not expect it to be 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.750
 in the quarterfinals we are only in 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.520
 eighth for the moment we support 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.930
 the french team to the end 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.149
 said we are halfway 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.070
 what matters is it's half way it's 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.100
 the end of the road is the arrival there 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.300
 must for all before the arrival there will be 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.440
 eighths against nigeria 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.729
 maybe the gap we hear that 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 you could go to brazil for 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.870
 quarter-finals is this true 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.430
 even if it was true I will not say it 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.380
 what will the wink to the 8th you 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 imagine if I will be there for the gifts 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.400
 we did not think of quarterfinals 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.440
 so I'll come back when I 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.060
 think it will be the most useful then 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.850
 maybe I will not have the opportunity to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.800
 come because here too we have to do 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.060
 Warning 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.159
 after the presence of the president of the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.859
 republic it must be 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.679
 where he is not necessarily called 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.319
 for the world cup I believe that the 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.689
 supporters are already there without me 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.950
 adds but if I can a moment we 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.140
 will see when we will see at what stage of the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.240
 competition if for a moment I can 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.590
 find book why not last 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.539
 question especially since the final is the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.399
 July 13 in France there is a parade that 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.560
 is called the procession of July 14 if we 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.229
 is in the final we move on July 14 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.399
 how to do when you are strong the team 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.799
 from France to Clairefontaine I gave them 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.310
 says this problem is that if you are 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.049
 finally 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.569
 it's the 13th of July and the 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.970
 champs-elysées are going to be taken for 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 the eventual event that could be the one 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.480
 of victory but I told them that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 matter we'll always manage on 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 the logistics plan the only thing it's 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 that the parade of July 14 will be the 14 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.420
 July but do not complicate the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.390
 life and not requiring always 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.150
 predict who does not expect all 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.019
 built we will beat the nigeria must 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.989
 beat nigeria 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.989
 finally treading is not the same 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.739
 when françois hollande talks about 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.060
 the team of France we are not sure he 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.230
 also talking about him what did he talk about 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.889
 also often does saint françois in de 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.480
 spin the metaphor 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 when he talks about sport other topics 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.359
 at the same time in France team the 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.810
 parallel is quite easy to do there are 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.160
 six months 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.540
 the team of France was at the lowest 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.060
 in the polls hated by all the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.599
 world today she is worshiped adored 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.919
 holland it to the lowest in the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.819
 polls he tells himself that maybe 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.079
 the example of the France team can 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.519
 apply to him even this day why 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.019
 not and then another moment where he talks 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 a little bit of it is when he says it's 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.290
 not put way that we judge whether at the end of the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.169
 in the end I can when he says that this is 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.069
 that's the low bank and his rhetoric about the 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.970
 presidential every time he says no 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.269
 do not judge me now but at the end of 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.500
 my mandate 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.120
 so yes he also talks a little about him 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.680
 in this interview and I do not have very 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.030
 well understood he goes to brazil where he goes 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.560
 not in brazil 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.440
 he can not say he will oppose but 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.550
 if we ever beat nigeria and if that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.230
 Germany, Algeria and elsewhere 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.780
 quarter-finals go couailhac why 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.069
 80 and 90% chance he explained what 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.330
 gets eliminated if I'll be still 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.709
 define the landslides eliminate the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.700
 prevents him from going to the quarterfinals if 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.250
 France and Germany Brazil but 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.260
 pierrot he can go there before his 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.520
 exit a little more if it goes with the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.930
 France loses it will be said that it's his fault 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.530
 doc m6 had been in the first round 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.580
 as mrs merkel 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.510
 you think they stop a myth there 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.709
 had not he took a ticket no 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.630
 refundable but they will have in all 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.230
 case is that July 13 if we are 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 world champion 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.750
 Normally we will not be able to go celebrate 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.130
 that would change then that I 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.810
 asks to see the rate of saying that 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.050
 Beijing milk tobacco that will tumble 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 on the people trained by you stone 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.459
 I am sure seditious as you are 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.459
 I am very seditious severity
