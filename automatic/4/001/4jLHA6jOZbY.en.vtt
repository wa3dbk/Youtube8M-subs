00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.259
 I 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.189
 hi all today a little 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.380
 video on the presentation of four 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:26.270
 rubicube to complete a little the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.910
 first video I had done then the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.390
 better known rubicube marc levy 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.840
 cult cube quite common we 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 find everywhere that I advise against 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.700
 then you have the mark dyan so 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.600
 a black version a white version 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.450
 personally I did not order them 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 in the same place that that it does 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.740
 not slip the same way 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.380
 although the dejan contrary to the 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:59.120
 rubik's cube you can tight and 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.040
 loosen the pieces which allows you 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 to slide more or less quickly depending on 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.840
 your aptitude may 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.869
 as much as I liked the white that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.850
 I had ordered so much now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.299
 I am totally a fan of my new 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 noah and slip a lot better so I 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.909
 do not know if normally it's exactly 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 the same die and in addition the same brand 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.830
 and especially the same reference die and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 so she so I do not know why 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.560
 maybe between the pieces the oil 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.509
 who puts etc and indifference and the lived 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 who always slips to him as well 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.330
 but has a lot less price does it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.210
 that it is in a ball unless taken in 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.720
 hand then to show you a little 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.789
 example so the vehicle is taking place 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 very easily veiled like this you 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.649
 do not have anti pop here then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.670
 antipop what serves the cube avoid 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.420
 pollute that is when you are 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.229
 in a position like these 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.250
 cube see your turns well alone 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.060
 by the way tried to do that with a 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.799
 cumulative mark of cubes 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.480
 it does not work the vehicle there's not him 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.220
 this problem all by itself parts 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.220
 are much more rounded inside 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.350
 and anti pop so it does not 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.470
 when I force you just too much 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.640
 do not blow up the pieces 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.700
 go everywhere but the rummikub 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.450
 despite the lived forgiveness despite he did 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.040
 no anti pop 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 hardly breaks out later in the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.190
 wadd bayane the cards and he you have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.640
 an anti pop see it's the little room 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.519
 here that you do not have in the in the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:07.470
 diane then me personally I 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.470
 recommend the one works very well 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.880
 the gs for example I really too much 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.660
 loosen the pieces then like that which 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.569
 looks like a cube from the inside no 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.790
 problem we'll do it I'll put it back 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.239
 after that is what it looks like 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.230
 simply 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.230
 and you sent small springs 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.670
 and you can vices and unscrewed 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:46.989
 to infinity because you can not 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.730
 do with the rubik's cube so fall is 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:57.060
 tight and loosen according to as I said 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:04:00.069
 in your ability to do so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.319
 and it moves very very well then me 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.069
 I use black now less 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.280
 one minute 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.109
 I can solve it finally it depends 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.859
 not always according to the complications that 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.079
 we can have 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.650
 but in general I'm doing well there 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:21.669
 will do a quick example 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:24.180
 forgiveness tashnaq well here here here here 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.180
 right here 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.870
 door I hurry because I 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.110
 finds 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:39.039
 you and I see that I was able to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:42.940
 a lot of batteries so go i m in 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:45.750
 face anyway if it's better I'm at 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.750
 just about the camera 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:20.860
 that's where it's good blue red mud 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:24.759
 orange green like this this is it 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.639
 good there is painted to spend well here 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.759
 this one is well placed red that goes to 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.759
 right 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 here 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.439
 see here huh I'm not going I have not 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.199
 watched 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:58.719
 but how it slips it smooth su su 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.749
 there is no problem 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:06.800
 I advise you that there is good 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:08.209
 I have to leave you with the battery 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.399
 is almost empty 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:12.409
 I do not have time to solve this one 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.689
 it will cut before unfortunately 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.559
 I should have reloaded sooner it's not 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:19.069
 serious I will do with 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:21.229
 good I hope it will give you a 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.269
 little clue anyway for them for 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:28.909
 the cubes 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:30.679
 after I advise you so if you 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.179
 want to start that you do not know 

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.919
 you can not solve the problems 

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:36.080
 cubes I start I recommend 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.759
 to buy this one at the first lived experience 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.869
 like that at least you can if ever 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.579
 you are for example in this 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:42.259
 situation says ah shit I'd like 

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:44.300
 their masters as before you want 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.369
 mount very very easily 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.129
 this will allow you to start over 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:51.229
 infinity until you were 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.059
 you hold the movements once 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.279
 you finish retain 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:58.300
 buy dai hÃ nh movements for 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.619
 to go faster and faster 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.969
 this is my advice 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.649
 now if you have questions 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.550
 especially do not hesitate I will make myself a 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:06.139
 pleasure to answer 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.699
 here on the resolution or on any 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.699
 what else are the ciao
