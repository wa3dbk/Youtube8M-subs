when they think pottery they immediately
think<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.630> plants<00:02:02.320> because<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:03.009> tends<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.460> be

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
think of plants because that tends to be

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.609 
think of plants because that tends to be
what<00:02:03.759> they're<00:02:03.880> used<00:02:04.090> for<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.079> guys<00:02:05.259> have

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
now Nick we are in front of a long line

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.880 
now Nick we are in front of a long line
of<00:02:20.270> fountains<00:02:20.960> all<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.500> them<00:02:21.620> are<00:02:21.770> beautiful

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and the the thing that is different and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.870 
and the the thing that is different and
new<00:02:24.740> with<00:02:24.860> these<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> think<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.700> lot<00:02:25.850> of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
new with these is I think a lot of

new with these is I think a lot of
people<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.300> seen<00:02:26.480> them<00:02:26.720> with<00:02:27.080> these

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
people have seen them with these

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.450 
people have seen them with these
containers<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.130> bury<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
containers that you can bury in the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.800 
containers that you can bury in the
ground<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.270> have<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.420> really<00:02:29.720> great

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
ground so you have a really great

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.890 
ground so you have a really great
selection<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.460> pot<00:02:31.460> in<00:02:31.730> pot<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.750> use

selection of pot in pot so you can use

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.420 
selection of pot in pot so you can use
that<00:02:33.020> in<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> patio<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.710> let's<00:02:33.890> start<00:02:34.100> with<00:02:34.250> that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that in a patio so let's start with that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that in a patio so let's start with that
one<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:34.820> we'll<00:02:34.940> talk<00:02:35.060> about<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
one and then we'll talk about the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.120 
one and then we'll talk about the
in-ground<00:02:35.780> ones<00:02:36.050> yeah<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
in-ground ones yeah you know it's a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.500 
in-ground ones yeah you know it's a
great<00:02:37.310> alternative<00:02:37.490> instead<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.180> having<00:02:38.330> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
great alternative instead of having to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.150 
great alternative instead of having to
bury<00:02:38.810> down<00:02:39.020> into<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> ground<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.980> could<00:02:40.040> deal

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
bury down into the ground it could deal

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.830 
bury down into the ground it could deal
with<00:02:40.280> concrete<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:41.030> sub<00:02:41.210> patios<00:02:41.600> decks

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
with concrete or like sub patios decks

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.770 
with concrete or like sub patios decks
things<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:43.460> can<00:02:43.640> find<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.240> pot<00:02:44.570> for

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
things like that you can find a pot for

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.240 
things like that you can find a pot for
the<00:02:44.870> reservoir<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.560> either<00:02:45.680> find<00:02:45.920> something

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the reservoir and either find something

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.010 
the reservoir and either find something
real<00:02:46.430> wide<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.880> low<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.360> elevate<00:02:47.690> something

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
tall and slender inside of it or a lot

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.250 
tall and slender inside of it or a lot
of<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.240> pots<00:02:50.420> come<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.750> three<00:02:50.930> descending

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
of the pots come in three descending

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.990 
of the pots come in three descending
sizes<00:02:51.800> yeah<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.250> easy<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.670> kind<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.910> a

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
sizes yeah really easy to do kind of a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.370 
sizes yeah really easy to do kind of a
tiered<00:02:53.270> effect<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.750> way<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.020> get<00:02:54.170> kind<00:02:54.290> of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
tiered effect that way and get kind of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.140 
tiered effect that way and get kind of
that<00:02:54.500> traditional<00:02:54.950> fountain<00:02:55.310> style<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:56.030> add

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
that traditional fountain style but add

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.090 
that traditional fountain style but add
a<00:02:56.180> little<00:02:56.420> spin<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.900> being<00:02:57.080> all<00:02:57.260> pods<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.890> if

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
a little spin on it being all pods so if

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.320 
a little spin on it being all pods so if
you<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.340> an<00:02:58.460> apartment<00:02:58.790> or<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> condominium

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
you have an apartment or a condominium

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.170 
you have an apartment or a condominium
absolutely<00:03:00.230> works<00:03:00.410> great<00:03:00.800> now<00:03:01.460> these<00:03:01.820> bigger

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
absolutely works great now these bigger

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.850 
absolutely works great now these bigger
ones<00:03:02.330> like<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:03.020> one<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.350> does<00:03:03.650> I

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860
