24th biology video and in this video I

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.660 
24th biology video and in this video I
want<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.040> talk<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.400> guys<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.700> life<00:00:06.660> so

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
want to talk to you guys about life so

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.870 
want to talk to you guys about life so
somes

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
somes

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749 
somes
now<00:00:09.570> lysosomes<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.349> special<00:00:10.980> vesicles

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
now lysosomes are special vesicles

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.039 
now lysosomes are special vesicles
they're<00:00:11.940> actually<00:00:12.210> made<00:00:12.360> by<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> Golgi

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they're actually made by the Golgi

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.900 
they're actually made by the Golgi
apparatus<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.130> job<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.549> these<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
apparatus and the job of these is

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.960 
apparatus and the job of these is
basically<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.900> clean<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.619> cell<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.699> by

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
basically to clean up your cell now by

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.330 
basically to clean up your cell now by
clean<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> mean<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.890> rid<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.160> all

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
clean up your so I mean get rid of all

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040 
clean up your so I mean get rid of all
of<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.609> harmful<00:00:21.000> stuff<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.600> cell<00:00:21.840> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
of the harmful stuff in your cell so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
of the harmful stuff in your cell so
you're<00:00:22.710> left<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> only<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> things<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you're left with only the things that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
you're left with only the things that
your<00:00:24.420> cell<00:00:24.689> needs<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.619> let<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.920> ahead<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
your cell needs so let me go ahead and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.970 
your cell needs so let me go ahead and
draw<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.880> here's<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> nucleus<00:00:27.750> right<00:00:28.260> here

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
draw so here's the nucleus right here

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
draw so here's the nucleus right here
good-looking<00:00:29.730> nucleus<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> might<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.199> well

draw some ER to give you guys a context

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.260 
draw some ER to give you guys a context
of<00:00:34.020> where<00:00:34.230> everything<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.940> some<00:00:35.940> pretty

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of where everything is some pretty

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780

good-looking he are draw some smooth ER

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.229 
good-looking he are draw some smooth ER
oh<00:00:39.680> nice<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.100> smooth<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> looks

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
oh nice and some smooth kind of looks

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.520 
oh nice and some smooth kind of looks
like<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> tapeworm<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:42.989> big<00:00:43.140> deal

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like a tapeworm no big deal

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
like a tapeworm no big deal
and<00:00:44.070> let<00:00:44.309> me<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.640> ahead<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> draw<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and let me just go ahead and draw the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
and let me just go ahead and draw the
Golgi<00:00:45.660> apparatus<00:00:45.780> I'll<00:00:46.410> draw<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.770> blue<00:00:47.090> Wow

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
Golgi apparatus I'll draw it is blue Wow

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
Golgi apparatus I'll draw it is blue Wow
that<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.710> that's<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.460> bad<00:00:50.730> looking

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that is that's a really bad looking

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.799 
that is that's a really bad looking
Golgi<00:00:51.570> apparatus<00:00:52.610> okay<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.670> there's<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.270> closi

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
Golgi apparatus okay so there's a closi

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.020 
Golgi apparatus okay so there's a closi
apparatus<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.579> let<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:56.940> go

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
apparatus right there and now let me go

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
apparatus right there and now let me go
ahead<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.239> dry<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> guys<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> lysosome

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ahead and dry you guys what a lysosome

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
ahead and dry you guys what a lysosome
would<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.329> lysosomes<00:01:01.260> would

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
would look like so lysosomes would

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
would look like so lysosomes would
pretty<00:01:01.710> much<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:02.090> these<00:01:03.090> things<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.780> here

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pretty much be these things right here

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
pretty much be these things right here
these<00:01:04.110> vesicles<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.070> floating

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
these vesicles that are just floating

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
these vesicles that are just floating
around<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.420> cell<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> lot

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
around your cell you actually have a lot

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.570 
around your cell you actually have a lot
of<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.159> cell

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of them in your cell

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.469 
of them in your cell
so<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.720> ahead<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.990> label<00:01:10.110> these

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
so just go ahead and label these

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.310 
so just go ahead and label these
lysosomes<00:01:13.880> right<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.360> here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
lysosomes right here in here

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.520 
lysosomes right here in here
now<00:01:16.770> inside<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.759> life<00:01:17.880> somes<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.530> digestive

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
now inside your life somes are digestive

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.039 
now inside your life somes are digestive
enzymes<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.150> enzymes<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
enzymes and what these enzymes do is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
enzymes and what these enzymes do is
they<00:01:22.229> break<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.560> crap<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.250> harmful<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
they break up crap that's harmful to the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
they break up crap that's harmful to the
cell<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.049> say<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.560> something<00:01:25.920> harmful

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
cell so say we had something harmful

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
cell so say we had something harmful
right<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> harmful<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.140> maybe

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
right here in harmful right here maybe

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
right here in harmful right here maybe
it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> molecule<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.579> your<00:01:29.850> cell

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it was just a molecule that your cell

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
it was just a molecule that your cell
didn't<00:01:30.420> need<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.840> maybe<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.350> was<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> molecule

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
didn't need or maybe it was a molecule

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.670 
didn't need or maybe it was a molecule
that<00:01:32.159> might<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.880> hurting<00:01:33.450> an<00:01:33.600> organelle<00:01:34.049> well

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that might be hurting an organelle well

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.620 
that might be hurting an organelle well
what<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.009> lysosomes<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> they

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
what these lysosomes would do is they

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
what these lysosomes would do is they
would<00:01:36.659> surround<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.409> molecule<00:01:37.979> right<00:01:38.640> here

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
would surround this molecule right here

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.210 
would surround this molecule right here
and<00:01:39.150> begin<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> break<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.619> smaller

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and begin to break it up into smaller

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
and begin to break it up into smaller
pieces<00:01:41.390> now<00:01:42.390> once<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.840> broken<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.259> into

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
pieces now once it's broken up into

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
pieces now once it's broken up into
smaller<00:01:43.740> pieces<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.149> cell<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> either

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
smaller pieces then the cell is either

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.270 
smaller pieces then the cell is either
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.140> those<00:01:46.560> pieces<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> build

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to use those pieces to build

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.980 
going to use those pieces to build
something<00:01:47.579> else<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
something else or it's just going to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.030 
something else or it's just going to
spit<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> cell<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.149> basically

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
spit them out of the cell so basically

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
spit them out of the cell so basically
lysosomes<00:01:53.040> break<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.210> stuff<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.049> harmful

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
lysosomes break up stuff that's harmful

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
lysosomes break up stuff that's harmful
to<00:01:55.680> your<00:01:55.770> cell<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.219> aside<00:01:56.969> from<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.240> they

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to your cell and aside from that they

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.340 
to your cell and aside from that they
also<00:01:58.110> help<00:01:58.680> remove<00:01:59.100> dead<00:01:59.549> organelles<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.079> say

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
also help remove dead organelles so say

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
also help remove dead organelles so say
that<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.829> an<00:02:01.920> organelle<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.820> know

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that we have an organelle I don't know

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
that we have an organelle I don't know
I'll<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.299> say<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.600> er<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.439> well

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
I'll just say this er right here well

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
I'll just say this er right here well
say<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> something<00:02:06.030> happened<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> ER

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
say that something happened to the ER

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410 
say that something happened to the ER
causes<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> die<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.520> lysosomes

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
causes it to die what these lysosomes

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540 
causes it to die what these lysosomes
would<00:02:09.599> do<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.950> surround

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
would do is that would go and surround

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.230 
would do is that would go and surround
this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
this

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.360 
this
and<00:02:13.330> start<00:02:14.020> breaking<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.620> up<00:02:14.740> into<00:02:14.890> smaller

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and start breaking it up into smaller

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.940 
and start breaking it up into smaller
pieces<00:02:15.490> now<00:02:16.480> whenever<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.200> broken<00:02:17.500> up<00:02:17.740> of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
pieces now whenever this is broken up of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.620 
pieces now whenever this is broken up of
course<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.850> harmful<00:02:19.180> molecules

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
course just like the harmful molecules

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.750 
course just like the harmful molecules
it's<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.470> broken<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.920> into<00:02:21.010> proteins

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
it's going to be broken up into proteins

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.990 
it's going to be broken up into proteins
and<00:02:22.030> other<00:02:22.150> molecules<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.830> pieces<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
organelle make a new ER or be just be

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.070 
organelle make a new ER or be just be
spat<00:02:33.130> out<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> cell<00:02:34.060> would<00:02:34.150> die<00:02:34.360> but

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
spat out and then the cell would die but

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.770 
spat out and then the cell would die but
nonetheless<00:02:35.970> lysosomes<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.450> what<00:02:37.660> they

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
nonetheless lysosomes that's what they

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
nonetheless lysosomes that's what they
do<00:02:37.930> they're<00:02:38.200> kind<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.590> garbageman<00:02:39.310> they

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
do they're kind of like garbageman they

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
do they're kind of like garbageman they
break<00:02:40.030> down<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.330> garbage<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> cell<00:02:41.500> can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
break down the garbage so the cell can

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.430 
break down the garbage so the cell can
either<00:02:41.830> throw<00:02:42.160> them<00:02:42.370> away<00:02:42.490> or<00:02:42.930> recycle<00:02:43.930> them

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
either throw them away or recycle them

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
either throw them away or recycle them
in<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> case<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.610> know<00:02:45.730> maybe<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> wants<00:02:46.270> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
in the case of you know maybe it wants a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
in the case of you know maybe it wants a
new<00:02:46.510> organelle<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.440> would<00:02:47.590> have<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.830> do<00:02:47.950> that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
new organelle it would have to do that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.940 
new organelle it would have to do that
so<00:02:48.970> remember<00:02:49.570> one<00:02:49.990> last<00:02:50.170> time<00:02:50.410> whenever<00:02:50.800> you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
so remember one last time whenever you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.400 
so remember one last time whenever you
have<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> harmful<00:02:51.670> material<00:02:52.210> lysosomes<00:02:53.080> break

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
have a harmful material lysosomes break

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.070 
have a harmful material lysosomes break
it<00:02:53.530> down<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.010> spit<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.700> out<00:02:54.820> or<00:02:55.240> whenever<00:02:55.960> you

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it down and spit it out or whenever you

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720 
it down and spit it out or whenever you
break<00:02:56.260> down<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> organelle<00:02:57.010> maybe<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.490> died

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
break down the organelle maybe it died

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000 
break down the organelle maybe it died
for<00:02:58.030> some<00:02:58.210> reason<00:02:58.570> your<00:02:59.050> cell<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.320> recycle

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
for some reason your cell can recycle

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.430 
for some reason your cell can recycle
those<00:03:00.160> pieces<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> new<00:03:01.300> organelle<00:03:01.780> so

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
those pieces and make a new organelle so

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.990 
those pieces and make a new organelle so
that's<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.860> lysosome<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.490> thank<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.880> guys

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
that's what a lysosome is thank you guys

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.460 
that's what a lysosome is thank you guys
for<00:03:04.180> watching<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.810> I'll<00:03:04.900> see<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.140> guys<00:03:05.170> in
