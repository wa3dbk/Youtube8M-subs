 hi and welcome sanchez y cÃ­a and ya what 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.810
 we have here luigi's mansion 2 for 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.060
 nintendo 3ds played where there are and 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.429
 well I wanted to bring you this unboxing 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.749
 to explain that once put to 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.720
 the sale 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.789
 you will have some video and good if you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 interesting we could try to do some 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.779
 series also depends on how you record and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 It also depends on the interest you have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.719
 we could try it like 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.579
 we did with uncharted with or without crisis 3 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.170
 liberation of ps vita as we could 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.019
 try to make one because of course it is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.199
 a period that deserves going to have 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.410
 one boxing will bring the camera A 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.109
 little bit here to make it better 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.589
 and well I have a desire to try it 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.160
 also that my mother was waiting 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.730
 this game in 3ds the truth that between the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.540
 castlevania and this one 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.870
 well, we have 3ds for a while, so I'm going 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.460
 to play in the 3ds xl as always and 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.640
 let's see what brings us good for 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.310
 in front of the cover to say that I have 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.280
 tried but I did not know well if we see the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.229
 cover in the dark this here is 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.550
 illuminates just like this is worth I'm going to 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.410
 try to see I'm going to turn off a moment 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.619
 the light I do not know if it's going to look good I think 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.619
 what not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.420
 there is more or less good you see that 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.810
 it illuminates something but it's not how it looks best 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.200
 but I already tell you that it is illuminated by 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.320
 back side then nothing 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.380
 he explains that he has the local game and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.060
 online game up to four players 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.500
 and good download because in addition if 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.520
 you want to play with a friend, you do not need 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.439
 that has luigi's mansion 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.070
 directly transfer the data and 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:00.290
 you can play the game, let's open it 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.590
 as always the five from nintendo 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.160
 this will not be business as usual for 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.070
 here our quick guide of programs of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.410
 nintendo 3ds as good as another part 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.260
 ghosts here explains it to us good 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.040
 explained a little bit because the movements of the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.670
 game suck 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.710
 if the movements are basically worth 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.250
 this over here 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.080
 90 percent bigger nintendo 3ds x 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.350
 7 Well, a little publicity 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.350
 as always among others xl then nothing 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.290
 We put this here and there you have what 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 Is the game 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.710

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.230

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.340
 and this is really this is a boxing no 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.530
 it has nothing of mystery is to say well it is 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.790
 always the same but good was more than 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 nothing to inform you that you will have 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.980
