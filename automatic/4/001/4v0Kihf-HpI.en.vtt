what are you wearing I'm wearing a
business<00:00:39.989> suit<00:00:40.170> basically<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.550> you're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
business suit basically so when you're

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369

working<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> workplace<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.230> think

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
working you're in a workplace I think

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
working you're in a workplace I think
it's<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.649> important<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> keep<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.370> lines

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's really important to keep your lines

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
it's really important to keep your lines
very<00:00:45.030> clean<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:46.079> least<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
very clean at least that's what I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.369 
very clean at least that's what I
whatever<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.140> research<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
whatever little you know research that I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
whatever little you know research that I
did<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.879> important<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> keep

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
did I think it's very important to keep

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
did I think it's very important to keep
clean<00:00:52.110> lines<00:00:52.410> straight<00:00:53.160> lines<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
clean lines straight lines so that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
clean lines straight lines so that
there's<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.149> too<00:00:54.300> much<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.440> body<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.890> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there's not too much of a body like that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
there's not too much of a body like that
right<00:00:56.719> yeah<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
right yeah I'm sure you do that so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
right yeah I'm sure you do that so
that's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> next<00:00:59.640> step<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.899> cover<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> in

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that's the next step we cover that in

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.920 
that's the next step we cover that in
the<00:01:01.559> next<00:01:02.030> don't<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.239> any<00:01:03.420> clean<00:01:03.690> line

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the next don't have any clean line

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.890 
the next don't have any clean line
bodies<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:06.180> long<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> keep

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bodies but I think as long as you keep

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.960 
bodies but I think as long as you keep
your<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.670> too<00:01:08.729> much<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
your you know there's not too much a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.820 
your you know there's not too much a
fuss<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.659> clothing<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.710> too

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
fuss in your clothing there's not too

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
fuss in your clothing there's not too
much<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> frill<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.580> lace<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.150> too<00:01:12.540> much<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
much a frill or lace or too much of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.390 
much a frill or lace or too much of
other<00:01:12.960> things<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.500> happening<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.250> long

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
other things that are happening as long

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
other things that are happening as long
as<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.670> clean<00:01:15.000> still<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.990> works

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
as it's clean still I think it works

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.330 
as it's clean still I think it works
specially<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.250> new<00:01:17.369> workplace

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.649 

yeah<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.579> think<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.420> play

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
yeah I think it's really good to play

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
yeah I think it's really good to play
with<00:01:27.930> colors<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.649> isn't<00:01:28.950> much

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
with colors because there isn't much

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
with colors because there isn't much
that<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.899> with

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that you can do with your you know with

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
that you can do with your you know with
the<00:01:31.200> cuts<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.430> fits<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.180> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the cuts or the fits so I think it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
the cuts or the fits so I think it's
sometimes<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> color<00:01:34.080> maybe<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
sometimes just the color maybe just the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
sometimes just the color maybe just the
shoes<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.549> wearing<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.630> just

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
shoes that you're wearing you know just

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.529 
shoes that you're wearing you know just
a<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.470> pop<00:01:37.830> somewhere<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.820> adds<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
a little pop somewhere that adds and I

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.600 
a little pop somewhere that adds and I
think<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> access<00:01:40.289> we<00:01:40.530> should<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.890> minimal<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
think the access we should be minimal a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.280 
think the access we should be minimal a
good<00:01:42.570> watch<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.229> probably<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> good<00:01:43.830> investment

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.290 

first<00:01:48.250> time<00:01:48.400> I'm<00:01:48.550> actually<00:01:48.700> wearing<00:01:49.000> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
first time I'm actually wearing a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.140 
first time I'm actually wearing a
release<00:01:49.710> heavy-duty<00:01:50.710> print<00:01:51.100> stripes<00:01:51.370> but<00:01:52.090> I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
release heavy-duty print stripes but I

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.630 
release heavy-duty print stripes but I
think<00:01:52.390> pinstripe<00:01:52.840> suits<00:01:53.200> give<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.280> edge

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
think pinstripe suits give it that edge

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.510 
think pinstripe suits give it that edge
of<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.690> know<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:56.020> little<00:01:56.380> bit<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.770> being<00:01:57.250> trendy

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
of you know a little bit of being trendy

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.360 
of you know a little bit of being trendy
