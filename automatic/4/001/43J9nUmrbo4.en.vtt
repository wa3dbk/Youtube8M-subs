to do

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.870 
to do
there's<00:00:25.109> obviously<00:00:25.830> bad<00:00:26.070> baiting<00:00:26.490> where

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
there's obviously bad baiting where

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
there's obviously bad baiting where
you're<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.269> capitalizing<00:00:27.990> off<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> bait

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you're not capitalizing off of the bait

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.359 
you're not capitalizing off of the bait
but<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> most<00:00:30.300> part<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.980> baiting<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> done

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but for the most part if baiting is done

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
but for the most part if baiting is done
correctly<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.510> help<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.930> team<00:00:33.960> win

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

mid and I'm just making a little bit of
presence<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> allow<00:00:57.090> my

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
presence here it's going to allow my

from behind and get a flank off any of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.430 
from behind and get a flank off any of
the<00:01:00.840> porch<00:01:01.109> players

the porch players

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.579 
the porch players
there's<00:01:02.399> baiting<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.359> teammate<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
there's baiting for a teammate which is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.250 
there's baiting for a teammate which is
being<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> bait<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.790> being<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.689> distraction

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
being the bait so being the distraction

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.640 
being the bait so being the distraction
because<00:01:07.680> baiting<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> two-way<00:01:09.119> street

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
because baiting is a two-way street

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
because baiting is a two-way street
you're<00:01:10.650> either<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.070> baiter<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> beatty

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you're either the baiter or the beatty

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
you're either the baiter or the beatty
so<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.400> bedi<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:15.210> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so if you're the bedi you're just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
so if you're the bedi you're just
causing<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.810> distraction<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
causing a distraction if you know that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.350 
causing a distraction if you know that
you're<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> bait<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.850> teammate<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> go

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you're the bait for your teammate to go

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
you're the bait for your teammate to go
and<00:01:18.540> date<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.250> play<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and date you then you're gonna play a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.420 
and date you then you're gonna play a
certain<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.229> baiting<00:01:23.040> response

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
certain way and then baiting response

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
certain way and then baiting response
from<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> enemy<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.430> let's<00:01:26.430> say

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
being thrown over the wall I'm going to

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.520 
being thrown over the wall I'm going to

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
assume that whoever's in B is probably

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.920 
assume that whoever's in B is probably
by<00:06:39.680> himself<00:06:40.150> because<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.419> smokes<00:06:41.660> coming

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
by himself because the smokes coming

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.090

all the ways that you can bait in the

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.100 
all the ways that you can bait in the
game<00:07:54.410> there<00:07:55.070> are<00:07:55.250> other<00:07:55.599> small<00:07:56.599> different

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110 
game there are other small different

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.830 
game there are other small different
things<00:07:57.500> that<00:07:57.590> you<00:07:57.710> can<00:07:57.830> do<00:07:58.039> to<00:07:58.729> bait<00:07:59.120> things

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 
things that you can do to bait things

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.540

teammate or to be bait for your teammate
but<00:08:04.220> for<00:08:04.460> the<00:08:04.550> most<00:08:04.700> part<00:08:04.820> the<00:08:05.060> baiting<00:08:05.479> is

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:05.570 
but for the most part the baiting is

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.200 
but for the most part the baiting is
done<00:08:05.750> correctly<00:08:05.930> baiting<00:08:06.830> is<00:08:06.950> a<00:08:07.010> good<00:08:07.550> tactic

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210 
done correctly baiting is a good tactic

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.270 
done correctly baiting is a good tactic
I<00:08:08.860> hope<00:08:09.860> this<00:08:09.979> helps<00:08:10.310> see<00:08:10.880> you<00:08:10.970> next<00:08:11.180> time
