00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.480
 Now I'm back with everything because 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.390
 because I discovered a very top game of the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.340
 My friend said that pirates are called in 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.420
 on here 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.829
 the romi is in a totally different place 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.360
 of the maps that we are accustomed to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.810
 other bad, right? 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.850
 and I'll show you a little bit today 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.790
 of the game in the next videos 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.079
 will be a series of guides like term 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.500
 skills 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.040
 so come on I will show how your 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.940
 car in the first so one only one 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.930
 introduction will have a complete guide 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.780
 You touched my friend as he does here and first. 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.460
 You start on these benches here and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.799
 then without these other diseases 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.650
 It gives advanced to take more or less 15 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.760
 m 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.130
 in three beats so money here is me 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.780
 I think it's quiet good best here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.770
 in others so much easier to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.230
 to get to have enough shops to show 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.000
 for you 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.070
 this store that is more for who has it 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.230
 that the guys use to sell the items 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.800
 stolen there 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.430
 Then my friend arrived like he does until 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.970
 took 138 here because he has sumo 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.000
 normal good provocation 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.160
 here is where herbology sells these 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.369
 things 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.460
 and here today he sold armor and 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.440
 weapons 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:17.040
 ipp costs 15 m the economy is very stable 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 and the pa so if you have questions 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.020
 As you can see, something has 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.480

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.880

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.800
 mobility only write two points two 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.420
 sometimes wrote on somoni type mobility 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.420
 there you will have it and carry it to the area 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.909
 ready 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.510
 and here is the love already to sell the 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:51.769
 things have three types of store 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.659
 I just found it super easy to opa just buy 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.129
 the right ingredients 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.129
 I would do one here. 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.239
 Let's see, I'll buy the ingredients. 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 acting in cash 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.330
 Holy crap to a bank here. 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.250
 but is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.540
 in the first shop of the viadinho here 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.060
 We do are all thankful that I 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 I like it and it gathers 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.810
 2012 I think maybe in the future not 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.680
 I know the way it is moving things 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.459
 maybe between a new fight and also 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.770
 top gives one of the things I most 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.580
 I really liked that you can have a home in that 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:47.030
 meets face so straight - laced kind sought 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.390
 this life is all good buy 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.390
 ingredients can already create the spirit 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.160
 and we will invoke you this is the most 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.390
 easy of all 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.120
 there already sent a wolf 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.010
 there are those that I can invoke are these 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 hence they appear here 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.880
 Good, but let's continue our 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.410
 paid to and also have a vote that is super 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.300
 Give me the time, too. 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.639
 It's cool, and Grandpa on server is because 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.310
 really a start that it escapes a lot 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.729
 good every 12 hours you can go back 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.630
 So we were going to show you the 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.610
 transports 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.490
 here is the compass that is where the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.180
 creche was in the original script 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.720
 I'll pack in 38 packages that are just ours 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.720
 training 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.099
 here in mons greater 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.999
 There are some pretty cool demons for us. 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.999
 to stab 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:12.700
 the graphics are also excellent 2012 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.050
 loading ready we are here 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.790
 the demons at level 92 elton who scored 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.170
 this project so that was the 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.550
 new combat keys goes here 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.550
 usually held a prayer 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.180
 and killed him drop even less than 200k 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.180
 is very little 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.050
 and you can so there are several 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.600
 Training areas also have mini 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.370
 games have boss has pk also has angels and 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.620
 There are teleports here for you. 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.970
 to choose is the ability that you 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.010
 want the panel 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.080
 So I think this is the first 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:02.670
 was only an introduction because it is the 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.080
 game has about 50 has 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.520
 this is the most 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.490
 The plane was 56 more or less yesterday. 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.599
 This is it, I think it's very interesting. 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.520
 game 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:21.139
