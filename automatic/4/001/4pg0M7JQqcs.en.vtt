00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.610
 the programs and applications that they see in 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.700

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.610

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.760
 well and in charge of the site we see the last 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.840
 version is obviously a beta and the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.020
 official version ok in the case 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.650
 I always loaded the beta 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.780
 we are going to download 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.280
 and it was not the option to obviously download 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.550
 we download install as any 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.010

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.270
 where it says where is the cover of the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.159
 forgiveness disk without data obviously fine 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.080
 how do we configure this to start 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.210
 we will have two options we can see 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.549

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 the clean theme please or here they are given 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.619
 account that a small thumbnail that 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.270
 same ok to set it up is easy is 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.670
 Right click on the skin can be on 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 the text or in the image we go in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.470
 options 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.300
 since you have loaded the options 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 let's listen to our player that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.040
 we want ok for usual high use nothing else 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.320
 on the staff 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.940
 since I have chosen that option they can 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.460
 customize the other option as 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.790
 we want I personally do not 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.220
 I get into this, I just change the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.560
 player and we give you save here before 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 the ticket 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.040
 As they realize, a small 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
 text 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.030
 where it was saved and we closed it was already 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 personalized 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.100
 ok this skin has by default where the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.000
 basic options of overtaking to trace 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.440
 pause 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.730
 and the song data 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.730
 we can also value it 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.900
 for the volume in these skins and in 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.010
 we all click on the skin we go down 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.010
 or we go up 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.810
 okay 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.430
 very well 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.099
 everything would be all like installing a new 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.050
 skiing well there are two options we can 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.000
 download a skin that brings a file 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.739
 executable that solid will be installed and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.030
 will replace this and the new one will be 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.510
 or a file of come the folders well 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.280
 in I'll show you the two options right now 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.390
 ok they download their skin 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 if this icon comes to you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.390
 it's the easiest for you 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.600
 only to have double download 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.450
 Click to install and realize 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.069
 and in install 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.129
 is found as mishkin change that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.629
 they had this other good by default this 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.640
 the easy way if the wall this icon 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.640
 just run it and replace the skin 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.430
 because they have good now if it appears to them 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.590
 the other option ok the second option is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 this one in which will bring us all the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.060
 folder with all files watered 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.980
 they just copied the folder 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 we do not go to the address where is the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.870
 skin in the case of using a version two 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.959
 points and so much 2.1 I think the last 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.950
 version is late nineties we 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.950
 We will direct to the following address 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.200
 unit was archived programs 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.160
 pull display this time skin 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.160
 and here we stick it 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.460
 ok that would be the way to install the 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.860
 skin I already had installed really be 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.870
 the following we are not going to our skin that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.080
 let's change forgiveness to our 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.080
 player 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.370
 Right click themes 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.440
 and we choose the theme that we want 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.040
 ok for example the one that has applied 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.040
 right now is this 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.509
 and the one who just installed him right now 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:25.949
 here they saw that copying the folder is 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:27.840
 this this comes with five variants is 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.250
 same 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.250
 we put this for example 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.990
 ok you already saw that I change the skin 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.370
 they have given way to do it in the case 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.520
 that comes to install is automatic 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.930
 or that we copy it right now we do have 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.080
 a beta version 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.670
 I think the 3.0 the last one which 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.610
 skin do not work in the way that 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.770
 teach works what is what is 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.980
 autoinstalable not the one that we copy the 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.870
 folder well to do it in the case of 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.700
 a beta version or that does not work in the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.800
 option to copy the folder where 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.110
 comes if it gives a display we do the following 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.110
 right click skin browser 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.590
 here will not appear all the good that 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.030
 we have everything installed in my case 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.640
 that I have installed 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.680
 we want to install a new skin if 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.100
 we click right on a corner 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.960
 existing 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.810
 in the case of possibly only you come 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.610
 the default that would be this 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.330
 and right to appear up options what 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.330
 let's open the folder 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.080
 because he will throw us a folder 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.600
 different here we go back a folder 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.900
 and here we would have all the skin 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.820
 well in this case not to do it in the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.170
 archive 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.290
 corresponding that you see was filed 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.410
 program city ​​display skin would be in 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.520
 it's in this address name is team 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:02.020
 the address here we will copy it paste ok 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.020
 in the case I will turn off because this 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.080
 and in this function this option only 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.880
 it works for editions for version 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.919
 beta 3 point and both 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.260
 ok in case it is that the 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.300
 folder for example like this one when 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.500
 come installable autoinstalable there is no 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.820
 problem be the version that is 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.110
 automatic is going to install is going to 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.180
 change i stay in the folder 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.430
 corresponding in the case of being the 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.310
 beta of 3 we had to do everything 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.229
 this ok that's all I hope there's 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.880
 it's very clear I will not be 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.520
 repeating it the people who ask 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.160
 I will not answer or even send 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.560
 way of the site not nothing ok this first 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.570
 video of 5 followed that I will explain 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.490
 these little options well 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.490
 remember I am 107 fausto goodbye
