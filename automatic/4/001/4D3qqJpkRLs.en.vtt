00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.490
 we immediately see the project allow to raise for a workforce to 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.310
 three points just as is so today i'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.589
 put an end to being on another of your mobile device 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.019
 such as a phone for other natural objects such as me here I 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:14.859
 it's done 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.369
 so the chapel is iphone 3gs has kept from a camera to a top to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.720
 the ipad buffy 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.569
 this one cadence 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.999
 I do not take the train of the east a bit too expensive 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.099
 so first of all you see that red collective gold empty 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.140
 ladies side of the tcm patch committing this crime 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.750
 but you have to be disconnected afterwards to make room for another cause 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.510
 so there you see in the network which are so close to my home 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 so j freephonie freewifi hp 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 we will create for this new ship made with ipad kepco started with 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090
 the parliamentary channel 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.330
 nathalie dechy 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.460
 so we can help put me so I'm just saying something 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.829
 I advise you 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.260
 really really 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.110
 if I said do not study this application unless you have like 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.090
 he says he 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820
 if we go out this summer 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.719
 those countries 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.100
 I think if you have a time of 6 8 and 7 years 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 donate the friction gamma with the edit because I knew 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.890
 but the pdl and friction when you have it you open it a lot less of 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 migrants 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.350
 8 it's over 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 so I click on pda but who suffers so first of all it is necessary that others 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.060
 a request initiative not why but I have other leads like five 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.690
 other trophies 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.670
 so in addition to sharpness it is 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 you can then choose only the modem we will call it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 jacques oudot how did you see how he had no 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.060
 there was no 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.180
 I'm not of the same kind that had no modem document report what I 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.260
 you quoted so the freewifi it takes 1000 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.090
 there I believe that all 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.430
 so in metropolitan France is also a good complement for the metro 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.800
 3 kloten if not a 6 euro race 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.049
 political parties 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.779
 we will have to activate so we are like that anyway 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.379
 we will monitor the people 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.859
 we unlock 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.639
 we wait near the age 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.189
 so we go challenge we wait it changes it looks 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 the new networks high note I regret I regret 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.169
 master and seek all networks 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.769
 we did what we see in the middle guillaume a job so we click drop 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.519
 and tomorrow as normally 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.840
 the password and so I'm surprised 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.629
 rejoin 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.659
 we're just waiting for i'm connected from euros 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.359
 I'm connected 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.359
 so now we will try to go on the internet 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.479
 should simply be on our site 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.859
 so we will go 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.129
 type your site 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.129
 3w I think I already had cute 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.719
 August 31 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.759
 iphone on altintop sport com here 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 so it's going pretty slowly like tubize 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 secure the 3g 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.639
 and especially that there I mean stop at their opponents cited wolves and 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.479
 shepherds for something like that I tend 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.479
 to be able to recognize each other very very tall 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.700
 so you'll see that his rivals 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700
 it's also rainy what it works very well 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.259
 so I assured you a little bit of time but now his allies 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.699
 it can be very useful or after it goes faster for sites like google 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.559
 the officer has for example 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.559
 on the chelsea side too much pride that wanted it to go very very fast 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.799
 it's not because we want on the site small break this little bit more 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.469
 time but it's just like 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.669
 so that's it 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.269
 so that was explanation for years for the likely website 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.649
 pattinson direct fire starts anyway 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.969
 so I wish you all a last time of a happy new year 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.309
 you say the same to register on the youtube channel and then a video 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:16.900
 on the new year contest 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.159
 will be going out this weekend at the prefecture
