really more of a companion device so let

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
really more of a companion device so let
me<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.509> talk<00:01:54.780> about<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> bit

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
me actually talk about that for a bit

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
me actually talk about that for a bit
right<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> Galaxy<00:01:56.790> gear<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
right now so the Galaxy gear is what I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
right now so the Galaxy gear is what I
thought<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.659> afraid<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.290> did

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
thought is is what I was afraid of I did

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190 
thought is is what I was afraid of I did
not<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.729> become<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.810> sort<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
not want this to become some sort of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
not want this to become some sort of
just<00:02:04.500> another<00:02:04.860> companion<00:02:05.460> watch<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.570> wanted

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
just another companion watch I wanted

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.210 
just another companion watch I wanted
this<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> next<00:02:07.590> big<00:02:07.770> thing<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
this to be the next big thing in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580 
this to be the next big thing in
wearable<00:02:09.060> technology<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.110> looks<00:02:10.500> like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
wearable technology and it looks like

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.809 
wearable technology and it looks like
Samsung<00:02:11.099> wasn't<00:02:11.430> really

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
Samsung wasn't really

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.509 
Samsung wasn't really
for<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.659> has<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.860> clunky<00:02:14.159> design

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
for that it has a really clunky design

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.300 
for that it has a really clunky design
the<00:02:15.299> design<00:02:15.510> itself<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.260> terrible<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.950> were<00:02:17.159> in

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the design itself is terrible I were in

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.009 
the design itself is terrible I were in
my<00:02:17.489> opinion<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:18.090> think<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.689> design<00:02:18.989> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
my opinion I think the design is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.440 
my opinion I think the design is
terrible<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.739> not<00:02:20.430> why<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> thought

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
terrible it's not why what I thought

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630 
terrible it's not why what I thought
it's<00:02:21.629> gonna<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:23.040> doesn't<00:02:23.219> even<00:02:23.400> look<00:02:23.519> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it's gonna be it doesn't even look like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.649 
it's gonna be it doesn't even look like
a<00:02:23.819> 2013<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.500> 2014<00:02:26.189> watch<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.969> looks<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.420> some

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
a 2013 to 2014 watch it looks like some

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.539 
a 2013 to 2014 watch it looks like some
old<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.829> doesn't<00:02:29.129> look<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.370> doesn't

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
old thing it doesn't look it doesn't

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.720 
old thing it doesn't look it doesn't
have<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.879> modern<00:02:30.180> design<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.109> also<00:02:31.730> what

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
have that modern design to it also what

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.309 
have that modern design to it also what
a<00:02:32.760> another<00:02:33.359> thing<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.689> noticed<00:02:33.720> about<00:02:34.109> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
a another thing I noticed about the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
a another thing I noticed about the
Galaxy<00:02:34.739> gear<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:35.909> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
Galaxy gear is that it's more of a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.539 
Galaxy gear is that it's more of a
companion<00:02:36.599> device<00:02:36.689> rather<00:02:37.500> than<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:38.129> smart

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
companion device rather than a smart

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.170 
companion device rather than a smart
watch<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:39.090> its<00:02:39.269> own<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.139> screen<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.950> very<00:02:41.760> tiny

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
watch on its own the screen is very tiny

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.849 
watch on its own the screen is very tiny
you<00:02:42.510> can't<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.230> much<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.469> that

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
you can't really do much with that

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.979 
you can't really do much with that
screen<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.970> guess<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.359> makes<00:02:45.540> sense<00:02:45.750> for

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
screen and I guess it makes sense for

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.259 
screen and I guess it makes sense for
that<00:02:46.049> device<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:46.980> device<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.519> specific<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that device this device and specific to

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.929 
that device this device and specific to
be<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.450> smart<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.139> be<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> companion<00:02:49.620> device<00:02:50.010> but

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
be a smart to be a companion device but

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.240 
be a smart to be a companion device but
I<00:02:51.180> would<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.599> liked<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> offer<00:02:52.650> more

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
I would have liked it to offer more

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.210 
I would have liked it to offer more
things<00:02:53.639> to<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> user<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.870> I'm<00:02:55.319> hoping<00:02:55.739> Apple

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
things to the user and I'm hoping Apple

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.030 
things to the user and I'm hoping Apple
or<00:02:56.459> Google's<00:02:56.939> variant<00:02:57.480> or<00:02:57.780> Google's<00:02:58.200> their

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
variants of the SmartWatch do offer

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.020 
variants of the SmartWatch do offer
different<00:03:01.859> features<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:03.000> just

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
different features like that not just

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.990 
different features like that not just
apps<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.319> work<00:03:04.530> with<00:03:04.799> your<00:03:05.010> smartphone<00:03:05.370> but

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
apps that work with your smartphone but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.640 
apps that work with your smartphone but
of<00:03:06.120> course<00:03:06.359> with<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> being<00:03:07.200> said<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.470> have

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
of course with that being said you have

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.740 
of course with that being said you have
access<00:03:08.189> to<00:03:08.340> features<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.819> s<00:03:09.030> voice<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.629> have

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
access to features like s voice you have

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.179 
access to features like s voice you have
access<00:03:10.109> to<00:03:10.230> features<00:03:10.379> like<00:03:10.680> find<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:11.129> device

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
access to features like find my device

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.420 
access to features like find my device
and<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.989> those<00:03:13.169> those<00:03:13.799> features<00:03:14.189> are

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and so those those features are

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.270 
and so those those features are
connected<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:15.540> your<00:03:15.750> smartphone<00:03:16.440> another

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
thing that was really disappointing

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
thing that was really disappointing
about<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.109> Galaxy<00:03:19.440> gear<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.519> fact<00:03:20.699> that

galaxy note 3 and the Galaxy Note 10.1

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.629 
galaxy note 3 and the Galaxy Note 10.1
but<00:03:45.870> they<00:03:45.959> also<00:03:46.319> did<00:03:46.650> say<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.040> once<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
but they also did say that once the

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.390 
but they also did say that once the
galaxy<00:03:48.209> 4<00:03:48.479> is<00:03:48.629> updated<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.139> Android<00:03:49.290> 4.3<00:03:50.010> in

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
galaxy 4 is updated to Android 4.3 in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.149 
galaxy 4 is updated to Android 4.3 in
that<00:03:50.549> update<00:03:50.909> itself<00:03:51.299> it'll<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.840> an<00:03:52.799> update

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
that update itself it'll have an update

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.920 
that update itself it'll have an update
so<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.639> could<00:03:53.790> work<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.479> Galaxy

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
so that it could work with the Galaxy

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.280 
so that it could work with the Galaxy
gear<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.729> maybe<00:03:56.729> after<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:58.139> whole

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
gear and maybe after that the whole

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.699 
gear and maybe after that the whole
handful<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:59.129> galaxy<00:03:59.699> s4<00:04:00.060> owners<00:04:00.540> will<00:04:01.470> be<00:04:01.590> able

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
galaxy s4 anyways let's just conclude

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.120 
galaxy s4 anyways let's just conclude
off<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.079> video<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:22.500> some<00:04:22.650> more<00:04:22.680> specs<00:04:23.039> I

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
off the video with some more specs I

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.680 
off the video with some more specs I
kind<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.430> did

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
kind of did

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.800 
kind of did
different<00:04:24.140> order<00:04:24.440> here<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:25.220> why<00:04:26.090> not<00:04:26.510> it's

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
different order here but why not it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.620 
different order here but why not it's
gonna<00:04:26.930> have<00:04:27.110> an<00:04:27.200> 800<00:04:27.680> megahertz<00:04:28.340> processor<00:04:29.060> so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
gonna have an 800 megahertz processor so

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.900 
gonna have an 800 megahertz processor so
not<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.260> highest<00:04:30.470> processor<00:04:31.370> out<00:04:31.520> there<00:04:31.760> but

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
not the highest processor out there but

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.640 
not the highest processor out there but
keep<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:32.150> mind<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.450> has<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.750> be<00:04:32.870> put<00:04:33.380> into<00:04:33.500> a

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
keep in mind it has to be put into a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.710 
keep in mind it has to be put into a
such<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:33.920> really<00:04:34.460> small<00:04:34.730> package<00:04:35.210> it's<00:04:35.600> gonna

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
such a really small package it's gonna

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.340 
such a really small package it's gonna
have<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.520> 315<00:04:37.520> milliamp<00:04:38.060> power<00:04:38.210> battery<00:04:38.390> it's<00:04:39.170> a

battery<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.550> Samsung<00:04:43.550> representatives<00:04:44.270> said

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
battery and Samsung representatives said

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.470 
battery and Samsung representatives said
that<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.140> battery<00:04:45.470> should<00:04:45.500> provide<00:04:46.340> up<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.450> a

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
that the battery should provide up to a

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.020 
that the battery should provide up to a
day<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.810> regular<00:04:48.530> use<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.040> there<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:49.820> have<00:04:49.850> it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
day of regular use so there you have it

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.690 
day of regular use so there you have it
so<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.600> should<00:04:50.870> be<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.350> would<00:04:52.040> take<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.670> a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
so it should be I would take that as a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.620 
so it should be I would take that as a
day<00:04:53.890> but<00:04:54.890> you<00:04:54.920> may<00:04:55.490> want<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.060> carry<00:04:56.300> that

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
day but you may want to carry that

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.330 
day but you may want to carry that
charger<00:04:57.110> around<00:04:57.440> because<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.860> might<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.280> to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
charger around because you might have to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.240 
charger around because you might have to
charge<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.480> sometime<00:05:00.020> between<00:05:00.230> there<00:05:00.800> because

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
charge it sometime between there because

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.390 
charge it sometime between there because
this<00:05:02.120> is<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.450> regularly<00:05:03.140> use<00:05:03.380> if<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:04.010> use<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.340> a

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
this is of regularly use if you use it a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.160 
this is of regularly use if you use it a
bit<00:05:04.580> more<00:05:04.880> than<00:05:05.120> what<00:05:05.330> they<00:05:05.510> test<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.020> with

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
bit more than what they test it with

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.500 
bit more than what they test it with
then<00:05:06.770> of<00:05:06.920> course<00:05:07.190> it's<00:05:07.400> gonna<00:05:07.580> run<00:05:07.820> out<00:05:08.240> before

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510
