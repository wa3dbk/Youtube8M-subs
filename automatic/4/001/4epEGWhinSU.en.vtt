 now you don't have to do anything
further<00:02:05.840> than<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.230> but<00:02:06.560> no<00:02:06.860> I'd<00:02:07.010> actually<00:02:07.250> no

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
further than this but no I'd actually no

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.460 
further than this but no I'd actually no
recommend<00:02:08.300> changing<00:02:08.780> up<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:08.930> coverage<00:02:09.350> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
recommend changing up your coverage a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.370 
recommend changing up your coverage a
little<00:02:09.740> bit<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.490> you've<00:02:11.090> got<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.450> certain

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
little bit so you've got the certain

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.410 
little bit so you've got the certain
areas<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> comer<00:02:13.100> better<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.180> right

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
areas to a comer better and this right

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.350 
areas to a comer better and this right
here<00:02:14.450> gives<00:02:14.810> us<00:02:14.960> better<00:02:15.350> coverage<00:02:16.210> all<00:02:17.210> right

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
here gives us better coverage all right

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.450 
here gives us better coverage all right
now<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.410> don't<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.710> do<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.950> covers

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
now you don't have to do all that covers

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.070 
now you don't have to do all that covers
adjustment<00:02:20.270> though<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.990> know
