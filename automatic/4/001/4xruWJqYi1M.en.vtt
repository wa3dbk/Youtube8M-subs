00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.779
 in this video I'll show you how I did it 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.309
 this observatory tank with this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.309
 embossed design 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.680
 I'll fix it, I did that right. 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:23.180
 a plate fold time controller 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.180
 securing the truck chassis 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:36.450
 the first made a little tin box 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.150
 f 3 mm with the dimensions of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.650
 tank - the thickness of the sheet 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:47.190
 define the relief profile because I 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.129
 I outlined the profile of the pieces that will be 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 glued on this same material plate 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.410
 mm 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.090
 I already had it easier 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.920
 could also be done with this type 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290
 material that can find receipt 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.129
 real estate 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.520
 good now I'll do the counting and cut 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.990
 I'll paste these pieces here later. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.990
 little box won so much 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.600
 stuck now I cut the feet can be 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 cut with a stylus or can also be 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:47.100
 be with lopes that only take 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 I need sandpaper as a sandpaper. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.060
 a rule of thumb you use the junk e 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.600
 also but not hard, I prefer this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.600
 text dump finishing piece 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 here all the pieces are cut to vote 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:36.000
 a trading has the parts are ready 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:39.300
 To paste, you have already collected the two pieces. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 central relief 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:52.080
 I will use as reference with the others 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:54.470
 I have already made the hole to put the cover with the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.470
 piece 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400
 yea 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.209
 yes just paste all other parts ready 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:02.680
 I glued all the high relief pieces of the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.680
 perfect tank 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 now I'm going to make all the rays and the lid 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:16.150
 I already made this cover 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.110
 I used real estate assembly pipino if 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.240
 keep it easy to work I made this cover 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.060
 on his outside 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:36.100
 now I'll ride it, it 's ready 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.020
 I made some rays that the lid 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.960
 now this process to do this in 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.919
 High relief is easy but a little 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.430
 Late 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.389
 it took me about five hours 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.000
 until now 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:56.449
 I also made the support of the tank 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.210
 is a plate taken in the elite test and 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:04.190
 It was also necessary to make 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:08.030
 a dive is to reinforce this do jacp 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.190
 the chassis of the truck and 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.190
 now just ride 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:23.000
 I'm going to ride a great way now. 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.000
 done like this 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.210
 stayed like this 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.509
 this process of high relief that you use in 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:11.969
 manufacturing watertight 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.969
 I also made the fuel tank 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:20.669
 the sides the glass 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:24.369
 the grid and also to find the way 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.330
 all the same method I used to 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:27.330
 make this tank 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.930
 For now, this is just everyone here until 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.930
 the next video
