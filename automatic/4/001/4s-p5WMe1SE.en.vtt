00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.530
 The 41 minute is always stronger 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.510

 41 ozil of all was a lot 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.030
 scolded for the services in the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.580
 previous play but this is great here 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.070
 placed on the left and then against the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.250

 It will continue right away 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.940
 Bastian Schweinsteiger and again 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.760

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.990
 before the break 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.540
 Germany leads two to one super 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.780
 conclusion of toni kroos to german 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.190
 The game is great for a break 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.190
 German view shot 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.270
 then the second half german 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.480
 team in this phase at the beginning of the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.250

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.540
 this time with it müllert for germany 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 it stays at 2 2 1 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 Sailors brought only little 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.650
 but then again if you 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.739
 every time he came on the wing, what 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.629
 dangerous that's motto idea that's right 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.739
 The step does not have to be completely lucky 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.239
 for the german team theirs 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 he has to stand up again for a short time 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.140
 move matuidi and so are missing the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.000
 crucial centimeter 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.250
 It will be tight for the show and its 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.239
 team the german team 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.489
 controlled this game here in the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.829
 final phase once again 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.170
 outflow from andré schürrle not in it 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.480
 but it does not matter at all 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 more than germany beats france 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.790
 here in Rio de Janeiro in the quarterfinals 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.530
