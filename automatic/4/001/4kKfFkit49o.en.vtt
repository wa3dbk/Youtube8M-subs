00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hey that happens very good family to all 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.880
 I am lady boss and as many of you know yesterday 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.889
 August 6 came us to exploit a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.870
 piece of update with a lot of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.120
 news and improvements that I would like 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
 comment on this video I will start 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 for the two new weapons that during 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 all this time since it came out 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.080
 game have taken out lots of weapons 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 new but in this case they have released two 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 more one of them is that of ramat and that is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.570
 a bucket of ink and you're killing the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 people to ink covazos well just 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.710
 has a medium range a lot of power and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 for my taste it's a bit slow and that's why 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 they have put the fast pumps and as 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.500
 you can see of special weapon carries the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.750
 tornado that really is the one that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 I use and it's the one I like the most and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 truth is that the play paints a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 heap and also cool a lot to throw 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 cubes to people who are in high areas 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 well a little high not too much because 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.719
 it does not have as much scope but it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 it usually hits quite well so in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 that aspect is cool and then we have the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 ink and love that it's like it's a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.439
 green is a weapon with a lot of scope 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.510
 a power lower than what I expected 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.310
 sincerely and quite slow in general 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.010
 I already tell you that I did not like it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.230
 a lot as a secondary weapon carries the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.660
 Ink curtain and special weapon carries 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.850
 my dear tornado has also included 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.560
 new footwear and clothing accessories that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.300
 will come out randomly as 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.640
 they usually come out so you can 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.830
 buy them in the store and the subject of that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.510
 some accessories have few slots 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.580
 for the enhancers really not 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.530
 it matters because you know that in 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.450
 festivals that perform some purposes 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.490
 of a week you can get super 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.170
 molluscs with which we can increase 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 the slots of those enhancers well 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 that we can really buy any 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.080
 type any type of shirt that 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.430
 then we can increase it in this in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.410
 this aspect we can increase the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.960
 enhancers without problems now let's go 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.330
 to move on to see the changes in the level of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.760
 experience as you can see now 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.680
 we can reach up to level 50 but the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.140
 conditions to level up change 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.940
 now they will use the same method that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.060
 the festivals that do some ends 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.430
 of the week here they will explain it to us in 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.950
 a friendly combat you will achieve more a 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.620
 point to paint 200 points to be painted 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.840
 400 points you will get more 2 and more 3 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.879
 additional if you win the fight 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.670
 now it's not just about the surface 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.650
 that you paint winning is also vital in a 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.150
 competitive combat you will achieve more one by 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.189
 every minute jce survives 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.220
 if you rise with the victory besides 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.110
 you will get more 3, even if you lose, you will achieve 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
 points for surviving so do not get 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360
 give if you give a pair and zone the team 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.010
 rival you will get more 10 at the time 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.739
 you will continue to earn money from it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.269
 way that does not change now 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.640
 let's move on to talk about the new 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.799
 game modes we have a couple of 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.359
 new modalities one of them is the 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.760
 Private combat where we can play 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.980
 up to 8 friends in the same game 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.170
 which is very cool can be fixed 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.120
 password so that only the people who the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.040
 have can enter the game and a 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.659
 Once inside the lobby you can choose the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.609
 game style and the scenario that 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.530
 you want so I understand the 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.359
 teams can be distributed as you want 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.950
 that is, they do not have to be 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.409
 balanced in numbers but they can 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 have more in one team than in another and 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.590
 we also have team combat 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.239
 to be able to ping with our 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 friends and being able to face others 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.579
 teams as you can see we can choose 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.250
 between duels between teams of 4 3 and 2 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.799
 people with the difference that if 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.019
 we choose team of 3 people can we 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.310
 put with a team of 4 attention that does not 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.590
 it's cool but 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.620
 if you are a team with less people what 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.200
 what they do is increase the speed of 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.910
 reappearance that something is something and now you 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.800
 I'm going to leave a background game playing 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.870
 with the spill tick so you can see the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.060
 madness of playing with this weapon that is to say they are 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.220
 deaths everywhere is crazy 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.319
 total and while I'm going to talk about 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 other news and changes one thing 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.310
 interesting that they have implemented is the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.290
 pairing mode to start 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.180
 you need more than level 10 to play in 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.670
 team combat mode and once 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.590
 inside the equipment is paired with 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.140
 rivals of the same level 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.080
 supposedly something that would be very good 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.120
 but I can tell you that this is not the case 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.310
 we 've been testing it and not 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.140
 match with people of the same level but 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.690
 that matches you with anybody in fact 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.100
 we have played with people with rank that 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 are the new ranges that have put 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.490
 right now before the maximum was more and 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 now it can be done from that less 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.430
 to that plus that is the maximum so this 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.650
 I already tell you that it does not work and so 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.200
 on top of things that have changed or 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.210
 implemented because for example they have 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.520
 added new songs to those that already 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.229
 we had the ones we already know too 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.449
 have made some arrangements and changes in 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.699
 some maps as viaduct park 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.880
 squid platform squid squid 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.800
 botanical garden and hake towers so 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.229
 it is possible that these maps we see them a 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.699
 little different and finally they have also 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.940
 there have been changes in some skills 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.349
 special secondary weapons 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.030
 clothing enhancers and even in some 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.340
 sounds if you want to expand the 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.400
 information in the description I leave you a 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.220
 link and now I'm going to move on to give my 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.479
 conclusion about this dlc about this 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.490
 update so big that we've 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.220
 had in is pla tours and I can tell you 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.900
 that has disappointed me enough I'm going to 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.940
 say the points I'll tell you why 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.949
 exactly is that I think it has 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.320
 been in an attempt but has not arrived 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.810
 to what should have been for a 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.240
 part I feel tied I feel not me 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.729
 I feel free to play what I 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.070
 want to play is to force us to 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.169
 play game modes at certain times 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.120
 you can only play one game mode on 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.949
 that they say what they want 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.050
 you can choose the game mode that you 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.000
 feel like playing at all times that's not what 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.870
 I can understand to myself that they force me to 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.480
 play a mode with 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.880
 or I do not understand it with the maps 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.030
 Exactly the same thing they have not done 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.490
 way to get the random maps out 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.250
 10-12 all the maps that have to be 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.800
 come out in a random way you do not 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.200
 they put two maps every two hours and you have 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.330
 have to play those same maps for two 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.810
 hours you have no other obligation option 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.620
 more than me personally I do not like 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.530
 then another thing that they have not implemented 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.260
 and that the search is super important 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.510
 by region please gentlemen gentlemen of 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.510
 nintendo because they make us play with 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.790
 Japanese and there is a difference of 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.190
 connections that it's not normal to kill a 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.470
 Japanese costs a lot that costs them 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.320
 search by region because they have not 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.060
 done another little thing more is that you can only 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.610
 change the weapon between games in the 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.100
 new team game mode because 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.860
 they implement that in a game mode and in 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.020
 others can not at least I have not 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.970
 seen I have not seen the option because I do not 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.010
 I understand it would be as easy as putting it in 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.960
 the others in the other modes of it 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.630
 not in the same way as not 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.740
 they have put so nothing guys gives me the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.410
 feeling that it has been 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.470
 in a good attempt they wanted to do something 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.599
 good but they have been left half 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.479
 have been half- finished is pretty 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.009
 honestly disappointing but good at 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.229
 least we can play with our 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.849
 friends as a team that's a breakthrough and 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.160
 there are also other things that you 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.599
 I have commented that they are quite good and 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.520
 nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.590
 much the video if it is like this do not forget 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.199
 give like and nothing more beautiful and beautiful 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.650
 see you in the next video a greeting 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.650
 bye 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.440
 have
