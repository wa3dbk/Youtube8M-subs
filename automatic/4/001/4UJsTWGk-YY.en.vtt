00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
yeah just probably not the best medium

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.890 
yeah just probably not the best medium
so<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:14.880> done<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> I've<00:00:15.330> created<00:00:15.480> this

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so what I've done is I've created this

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.390 
so what I've done is I've created this
very<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.560> quick<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.100> basic<00:00:17.640> reward<00:00:18.270> system

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
very very quick and basic reward system

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.099 
very very quick and basic reward system
that<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.670> you'll<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:21.650> 1.7.2<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.519> 1.8

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
that is you'll see 1.7.2 as well as 1.8

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.540 
that is you'll see 1.7.2 as well as 1.8
compatible<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.199> mean<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.470> okay<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.039> 1.8

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
compatible I mean if okay if you do 1.8

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
compatible I mean if okay if you do 1.8
you<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> re<00:00:27.800> restart<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> whole

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you will need to re restart the whole

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 
you will need to re restart the whole
clock<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> clock<00:00:29.760> will<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.910> frozen<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
clock so the clock will be frozen but

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
clock so the clock will be frozen but
this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> completely<00:00:31.080> an<00:00:31.650> athlete<00:00:31.949> 1.8

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
this is completely an athlete 1.8

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.470 
this is completely an athlete 1.8
compatible<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.239> well<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.890> 1.7.2<00:00:34.969> okay<00:00:35.969> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
compatible as well as 1.7.2 okay so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
compatible as well as 1.7.2 okay so
first<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.079> did<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> basic

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
first of which is did you do a basic

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
first of which is did you do a basic
setup<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.290> using<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
setup so what we're going to be using is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.750 
setup so what we're going to be using is
we<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.160> using<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> scoreboard

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
we are going to be using a scoreboard

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
we are going to be using a scoreboard
objectives<00:00:42.390> add<00:00:42.540> reward<00:00:43.410> dummy<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
objectives add reward dummy so this is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.900 
objectives add reward dummy so this is
just<00:00:44.570> when<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.960> which<00:00:46.559> reward<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.520> give<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
just when we know which reward to give a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
just when we know which reward to give a
particular<00:00:48.390> player<00:00:48.770> next<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:50.010> gonna<00:00:50.070> set

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
particular player next we're gonna set

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.310 
particular player next we're gonna set
all<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> players<00:00:50.969> rewards<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> zero<00:00:52.219> okay

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
all of the players rewards to zero okay

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
all of the players rewards to zero okay
probably<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> nevermind

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
probably don't need to do that nevermind

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
probably don't need to do that nevermind
then<00:00:57.239> we're<00:00:57.390> gonna<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.840> add<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.379> stat

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
then we're gonna we're gonna add a stat

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
then we're gonna we're gonna add a stat
okay<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
okay so this is now where and this is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
okay so this is now where and this is
just<00:01:02.070> examples<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> could<00:01:03.239> possibly

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
just examples of how you could possibly

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
just examples of how you could possibly
reward<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.559> player

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
reward a player

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
okay so scoreboard objectives add spider

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
okay so scoreboard objectives add spider
stat<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> kill<00:01:08.760> entity<00:01:09.510> spider<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.619> every

stat that kill entity spider so every
time<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.310> player<00:01:11.580> kills<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.180> spider<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.750> will

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
time a player kills a spider it will

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
time a player kills a spider it will
automatically<00:01:13.799> increment<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:15.420> spider

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

squirrel two will then get removed right
now<00:04:20.760> however<00:04:21.269> we<00:04:21.690> now<00:04:21.840> need<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.079> transfer<00:04:22.890> the

now however we now need to transfer the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.610 
now however we now need to transfer the
spider<00:04:23.820> score<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> reward<00:04:24.990> score<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:25.469> this

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
spider score to the reward score so this

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.240 
spider score to the reward score so this
is<00:04:25.770> what

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
is what

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.310 
is what
these<00:04:26.400> two<00:04:26.880> command<00:04:27.210> blocks<00:04:27.420> over<00:04:27.630> here<00:04:28.080> do

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
these two command blocks over here do

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.720 
these two command blocks over here do
the<00:04:29.070> first<00:04:29.310> one

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
the first one

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.690 
the first one
it<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.690> says<00:04:30.870> scoreboard<00:04:31.650> players<00:04:32.040> set<00:04:32.340> at

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
it just says scoreboard players set at

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.720 
it just says scoreboard players set at
all<00:04:33.240> score<00:04:33.930> underscore<00:04:34.260> spider<00:04:34.950> underscore

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
all score underscore spider underscore

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.210 
all score underscore spider underscore
minimum<00:04:36.390> equals<00:04:36.750> five<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.710> if<00:04:37.800> they've<00:04:37.980> got

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
minimum equals five so if they've got

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.340 
minimum equals five so if they've got
five<00:04:38.820> or<00:04:39.090> more<00:04:40.250> set<00:04:41.250> their<00:04:41.640> rewards<00:04:42.330> go<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:43.050> two

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
five or more set their rewards go to two

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.530 
five or more set their rewards go to two
so<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.070> kill<00:04:44.400> five<00:04:44.580> spiders<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.180> get<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> reward

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
so I kill five spiders I get a reward

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.840 
so I kill five spiders I get a reward
score<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.170> two<00:04:46.380> over<00:04:46.560> here<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.310> clock<00:04:47.550> ticks

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
score of two over here the clock ticks

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.180 
score of two over here the clock ticks
by<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.090> next<00:04:48.600> tick<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.620> come<00:04:49.770> on<00:04:49.830> block<00:04:50.040> a

via picks up that I've got to gives me a
diamond<00:04:52.410> block<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.950> then<00:04:53.340> removes<00:04:54.060> that

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
diamond block it then removes that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.320 
diamond block it then removes that
spiders<00:04:55.140> call<00:04:55.380> from<00:04:55.590> him<00:04:55.740> okay<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.340> know<00:04:57.090> that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
spiders call from him okay I know that

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.200 
spiders call from him okay I know that
the<00:04:57.690> rewards<00:04:58.140> go<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.890> next<00:04:59.070> one<00:04:59.220> here<00:04:59.490> does

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
the rewards go the next one here does

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.060 
the rewards go the next one here does
exactly<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.750> same<00:05:00.780> as<00:05:01.350> that<00:05:01.500> one<00:05:01.650> over<00:05:01.860> there

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
exactly the same as that one over there

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.270 
exactly the same as that one over there
it<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:02.550> sets<00:05:02.910> my<00:05:03.180> spider<00:05:03.780> score<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.470> zero<00:05:04.890> if

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
it just sets my spider score to zero if

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.970 
it just sets my spider score to zero if
I<00:05:05.880> have<00:05:06.030> minimum<00:05:06.360> minimum<00:05:07.050> five<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.680> obviously

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
I have minimum minimum five so obviously

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.010 
I have minimum minimum five so obviously
this<00:05:08.160> order<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.570> running<00:05:09.690> in<00:05:09.900> is

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
this order that this is running in is

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.260 
this order that this is running in is
very<00:05:10.320> very<00:05:10.620> important<00:05:11.100> okay<00:05:11.250> because<00:05:12.030> this

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
very very important okay because this

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.030 
very very important okay because this
sets<00:05:12.720> my<00:05:12.870> score<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.290> then<00:05:13.500> clears<00:05:13.890> that

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
sets my score and then clears that

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.700 
sets my score and then clears that
school<00:05:14.600> so<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.780> don't<00:05:15.870> get<00:05:16.110> multiple

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
school so that I don't get multiple

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.650 
school so that I don't get multiple
items<00:05:17.460> keep<00:05:17.700> on<00:05:17.940> being<00:05:18.590> handed<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.710> me<00:05:19.830> okay

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
items keep on being handed to me okay

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.330 
items keep on being handed to me okay
and<00:05:21.660> then<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.350> way<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.650> stone<00:05:22.860> works<00:05:23.130> is

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
and then the way the stone works is

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.090 
and then the way the stone works is
exactly<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.850> same<00:05:24.500> scoreboard<00:05:25.500> play<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.740> set
