00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.490 
the rest of these people we have to take
out<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.360> there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> bunch<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> cars<00:00:37.230> that'll

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
out so there's a bunch of cars that'll

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.910 
out so there's a bunch of cars that'll
pull<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> let<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> bunch<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.379> guys<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
pull up and let out a bunch of guys I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
pull up and let out a bunch of guys I
find<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.149> better<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.840> stick<00:00:43.200> around

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
find that it's better to stick around

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
find that it's better to stick around
the<00:00:43.680> edges<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> map<00:00:44.730> stay<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the edges of the map stay around the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
the edges of the map stay around the
back<00:00:45.809> side<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.350> try<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> sneak<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.700> them

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
back side and try to sneak up on them

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 
back side and try to sneak up on them
because<00:00:47.969> they're<00:00:48.450> focused<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
because they're focused in on the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
because they're focused in on the
airship<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.719> they're<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.590> looking

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
airship so they're not really looking

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.360 
airship so they're not really looking
for<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.730> necessarily<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.739> long<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
sometimes you know it'll start ringing

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.139

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
stuff at your disposal so I mean there's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.050 
stuff at your disposal so I mean there's
a<00:03:11.560> lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.770> guys<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.640> take<00:03:12.820> out

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
a lot of guys that you have to take out

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.440 
a lot of guys that you have to take out
but<00:03:13.870> there's<00:03:14.110> not<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.620> many<00:03:14.800> where<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.610> think

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
but there's not so many where I think

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.180 
but there's not so many where I think
you<00:03:16.570> have<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:16.900> super<00:03:17.470> super<00:03:17.860> conservative

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
you have to be super super conservative

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.640 
you have to be super super conservative
with<00:03:18.850> your<00:03:18.970> ammo<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.990> times<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.380> games

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
with your ammo one of the times in games

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.230 
with your ammo one of the times in games
I'm<00:03:21.490> sometimes<00:03:22.450> way<00:03:22.960> too<00:03:22.990> conservative<00:03:24.240> this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
I'm sometimes way too conservative this

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.450 
I'm sometimes way too conservative this
stuff<00:03:28.170> because<00:03:29.170> I'm<00:03:29.410> always<00:03:29.590> thinking<00:03:30.040> well

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
stuff because I'm always thinking well

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.640 
stuff because I'm always thinking well
there<00:03:30.700> might<00:03:30.850> be<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.060> section<00:03:31.570> ahead<00:03:31.870> where<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
there might be a section ahead where I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.850 
there might be a section ahead where I
might<00:03:33.010> need<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.730> know<00:03:34.440> or<00:03:35.440> might<00:03:35.620> need<00:03:35.830> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
might need this you know or might need a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.900 
might need this you know or might need a
lot<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.360> can<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.380> know<00:03:38.910> do

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
lot of it so if I can you know do

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.790

hand-to-hand<00:03:40.450> combat<00:03:40.960> as<00:03:41.290> much<00:03:41.500> as<00:03:41.620> possible

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
hand-to-hand combat as much as possible

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:58.090 
hand-to-hand combat as much as possible
a<00:03:42.610> lot<00:03:43.240> of<00:03:43.270> times<00:03:43.540> I'll<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.550

sometimes there's a guy up here next to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.910 
sometimes there's a guy up here next to
these<00:04:00.650> cars<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:02.390> wasn't<00:04:02.990> letting<00:04:03.290> letting<00:04:03.830> me
