you can get a little Burton charm and
this<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.500> probably<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.069> best<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.640> around

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
this is probably the best just around

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.250 
this is probably the best just around
one<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.300> go<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.959> if<00:02:35.050> you're<00:02:35.170> doing

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
one to go for but if you're doing

one to go for but if you're doing
something<00:02:35.410> very<00:02:35.769> specific<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.550> that's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
something very specific then that's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.530 
something very specific then that's
where<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.940> other<00:02:37.060> ones<00:02:37.209> come<00:02:37.330> in

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
scooter text you from fire and lava can

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.340 
scooter text you from fire and lava can
be<00:03:06.519> combined<00:03:06.850> with<00:03:06.940> viruses<00:03:07.360> oceans<00:03:07.930> be<00:03:08.140> even

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
be combined with viruses oceans be even

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.930 
be combined with viruses oceans be even
more<00:03:08.440> resistant<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> honestly<00:03:09.790> don't

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
more resistant but I honestly don't

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.800 
more resistant but I honestly don't
think<00:03:10.090> that's<00:03:10.450> necessary<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:13.420> you're

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
think that's necessary because you're

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.900 
think that's necessary because you're
100<00:03:14.200> percent<00:03:14.260> resistant<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.340> wait<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.790> know

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
100 percent resistant and wait you know

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.729 
100 percent resistant and wait you know
where<00:03:16.630> down<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.840> your<00:03:17.109> armor<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.350> little<00:03:17.590> less

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
like you know five connection free

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.110 
like you know five connection free
that'll<00:03:33.130> be<00:03:33.190> dead<00:03:33.400> they'll<00:03:33.640> be<00:03:33.760> dead<00:03:33.940> than

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
that'll be dead they'll be dead than

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.880 
that'll be dead they'll be dead than
fire<00:03:34.299> their<00:03:34.870> protection<00:03:35.380> free<00:03:35.560> if<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.859> have

fire their protection free if you have

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.560 
fire their protection free if you have
protection<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.549> that's<00:03:36.760> probably<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.209> better

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
protection for that's probably a better

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.569 
protection for that's probably a better
move<00:03:37.950> around<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.190> I'm<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.489> keep

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
move around is I'm going to keep

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.370 
move around is I'm going to keep
suggesting<00:03:40.359> in<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.450> video<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.079> this<00:03:41.230> is

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
suggesting in this video and this is

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.569 
suggesting in this video and this is
only<00:03:41.500> two<00:03:41.680> pieces<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.950> armor<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.250> met<00:03:42.549> that

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
only two pieces of armor just met that

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.789 
only two pieces of armor just met that
in<00:03:42.760> mind<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.840> even<00:03:44.170> more<00:03:44.380> than<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.650> can

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
in mind you have even more than you can

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.710 
in mind you have even more than you can
get<00:03:44.920> even<00:03:45.040> more<00:03:45.310> magic<00:03:46.090> stuff<00:03:46.239> done<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.570> next

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
get even more magic stuff done so next

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.020 
get even more magic stuff done so next
we<00:03:46.900> have<00:03:46.930> blast<00:03:47.290> protection<00:03:47.489> or<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.670> device

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
we have blast protection or so device

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.430 
we have blast protection or so device
and<00:03:49.299> start<00:03:49.480> doing<00:03:49.630> damage<00:03:49.720> me<00:03:50.019> now<00:03:50.170> cuz<00:03:50.380> I've

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
and start doing damage me now cuz I've

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.229 
and start doing damage me now cuz I've
got<00:03:50.620> I've<00:03:50.950> got<00:03:50.980> fire<00:03:51.340> protection<00:03:51.609> armor<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:51.970> so

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
got I've got fire protection armor on so

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.050 
got I've got fire protection armor on so
I'll<00:03:52.299> just<00:03:52.450> quickly<00:03:52.569> wait<00:03:52.900> for<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:54.060> blast

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
I'll just quickly wait for that blast

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.550 
I'll just quickly wait for that blast
protection<00:03:55.180> protects<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.810> from<00:03:55.840> creepers

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
protection protects you from creepers

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.949 
protection protects you from creepers
and<00:03:56.590> explosions<00:03:57.280> creepers<00:03:58.269> auntie<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.750> C<00:03:58.900> are

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
and explosions creepers auntie and C are

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.349 
and explosions creepers auntie and C are
the<00:03:59.019> only<00:03:59.170> two<00:03:59.350> sources<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.769> explosions<00:04:00.359> again

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
the only two sources of explosions again

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.030 
the only two sources of explosions again
this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.630> very<00:04:01.690> specialized<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.829> just

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
this is very specialized if you just

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.860 
this is very specialized if you just
really<00:04:03.370> annoyed<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:03.700> creepers<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.150> being

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
really annoyed it creepers and being

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.840 
really annoyed it creepers and being
killed<00:04:05.049> by<00:04:05.230> them<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.590> guess<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.549> is<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
killed by them I guess this is the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.599 
killed by them I guess this is the
enchantment<00:04:07.120> for<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:08.190> hopefully<00:04:09.190> find<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
enchantment for you hopefully find a

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.030 
enchantment for you hopefully find a
creeper<00:04:10.060> cuz<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.079> don't<00:04:11.139> have<00:04:11.350> any<00:04:11.470> TNT<00:04:11.859> laid

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
creeper cuz I don't have any TNT laid

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.000 
creeper cuz I don't have any TNT laid
down<00:04:12.190> right<00:04:12.430> now<00:04:12.810> creepers<00:04:13.810> where<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.319> at

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
down right now creepers where you at

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.770 
down right now creepers where you at
yeah<00:04:15.430> does<00:04:15.670> it's<00:04:16.090> very<00:04:16.299> similar<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.659> regular

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
yeah does it's very similar to regular

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.390 
yeah does it's very similar to regular
ping<00:04:17.080> your<00:04:17.200> own<00:04:17.320> take<00:04:17.530> half<00:04:17.739> heart<00:04:17.979> damage

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
ping your own take half heart damage

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.409 
ping your own take half heart damage
from<00:04:19.330> creepers

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
from creepers

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.629 
from creepers
in<00:04:21.349> hard<00:04:21.620> game<00:04:21.829> modes<00:04:22.069> I'll<00:04:22.189> be<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> bit<00:04:22.490> more

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
in hard game modes I'll be a bit more

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.629 
in hard game modes I'll be a bit more
protective<00:04:23.090> than<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.960> protection<00:04:24.639> and

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
protective than just a protection and

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.309 
protective than just a protection and
normal<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.150> think<00:04:26.419> just<00:04:26.689> protection<00:04:27.199> will

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
normal I think just protection will

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.640 
normal I think just protection will
cover<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:28.069> as<00:04:28.219> well<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:30.080> easy<00:04:30.289> York

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
cover you just as well and in easy York

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.050 
cover you just as well and in easy York
actually<00:04:31.009> slightly<00:04:31.189> bear-bear<00:04:31.490> normal<00:04:31.849> no

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
actually slightly bear-bear normal no

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.540 
actually slightly bear-bear normal no
difference<00:04:32.419> so<00:04:33.169> next<00:04:33.499> finally<00:04:33.919> we<00:04:34.370> have

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
difference so next finally we have

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.719 
difference so next finally we have
ourselves<00:04:35.150> take<00:04:36.110> these<00:04:36.289> off<00:04:36.469> next<00:04:37.279> week<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
ourselves take these off next week and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.820 
ourselves take these off next week and
finally<00:04:37.969> we<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.599> ourselves<00:04:38.749> a<00:04:39.379> projectile

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
finally we have ourselves a projectile

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.850 
finally we have ourselves a projectile
protection<00:04:40.029> which<00:04:41.029> is<00:04:41.469> protection<00:04:42.469> from

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
protection which is protection from

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.830 
protection which is protection from
