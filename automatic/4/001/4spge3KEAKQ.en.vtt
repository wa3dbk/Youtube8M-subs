00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 

through<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.209> years<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.629> guess<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.110> was<00:02:15.260> one

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
through the years I guess it was one

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.759 
through the years I guess it was one
time<00:02:15.680> when<00:02:15.860> was<00:02:15.950> Rich<00:02:16.099> Brooks<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:18.170> we

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
time when was Rich Brooks and I we we we

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.589 
time when was Rich Brooks and I we we we
were<00:02:18.860> both<00:02:19.099> fast<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:19.940> were<00:02:20.000> both<00:02:20.239> right<00:02:20.450> up

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
front so we have to keep an eye on each

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.390 
front so we have to keep an eye on each
other<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:23.060> where<00:02:23.239> we<00:02:23.390> were<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.400> Kenny
