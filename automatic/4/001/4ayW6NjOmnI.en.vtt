unfortunately there are so many lines of
sight<00:02:03.579> that<00:02:03.849> your<00:02:04.329> you're<00:02:04.779> gonna<00:02:04.959> die<00:02:05.169> there's

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
sight that your you're gonna die there's

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.959 
sight that your you're gonna die there's
just<00:02:05.709> way<00:02:06.159> too<00:02:06.219> much<00:02:06.429> cover<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:06.849> you're

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
just way too much cover if you're

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.449 
just way too much cover if you're
getting<00:02:07.239> beef<00:02:07.539> like<00:02:07.779> but<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:09.250> how<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
getting beef like but that's how the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
getting beef like but that's how the
cookie<00:02:09.759> crumbles<00:02:09.789> here<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:11.290> let's<00:02:11.590> go<00:02:11.710> over<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
cookie crumbles here so let's go over a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.620 
cookie crumbles here so let's go over a
couple<00:02:12.040> ways<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.880> help<00:02:13.090> defend

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
couple ways that you can help defend

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.220 
couple ways that you can help defend
against<00:02:13.930> this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.630 

now<00:02:18.230> let's<00:02:18.380> say<00:02:18.530> we're<00:02:18.680> playing<00:02:18.800> domination

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
now let's say we're playing domination

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360 
now let's say we're playing domination
we<00:02:20.240> have<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.660> dumb<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.290> you're<00:02:21.950> gonna<00:02:22.100> take

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
we have be dumb and you're gonna take

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.920 
we have be dumb and you're gonna take
this<00:02:22.520> defensive<00:02:23.030> stance<00:02:23.240> because<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> other

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
this defensive stance because the other

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.390 
this defensive stance because the other
team<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.530> they're<00:02:24.740> spawning<00:02:24.980> over

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
team you know they're spawning over

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.950 
team you know they're spawning over
there<00:02:25.580> they're<00:02:26.120> gonna<00:02:26.210> be<00:02:26.390> coming<00:02:26.660> down<00:02:26.780> this

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
there they're gonna be coming down this

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.480 
there they're gonna be coming down this
aisle<00:02:27.140> that's<00:02:27.320> one<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.710> paths<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.070> travel

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
aisle that's one of the paths to travel

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.340 
aisle that's one of the paths to travel
one<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.270> guys<00:02:29.390> when<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> enemy<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.290> going
