00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello together I had the yes 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 new make up and concealer brush by 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.290
 I bought Evelyn and I wanted him for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 use it because I do not use it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.060
 use make up and for concealer is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.060
 definitely too big for me i already have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.480
 when unpacking noticed that's how it looks 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.140
 Although quite good from quite stable and so 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 but if you look it is yes 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 not really tied but there 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 would be so much space again 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 that in the serving and by that he is 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.210
 also very unstable so if I am 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.629
 then I want to open something 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.910
 actually hardly off the spot 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.340
 because I hope you can explain it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 realize that so really very 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.680
 very much gives in and somehow not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.479
 so easy to use is I say now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 So that's why you're just now 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 loses the enormous number I 've got 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 then washed at least once 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.189
 I'm not sure if I already 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 washed twice but there he has 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.869
 no lost and now i have now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.299
 already 45 color so short and good me 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.210
 do not really find them 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.720
 recommended with a bit of exercise 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 it works, but then I would 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 I prefer a decent buffer 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 buy brushes because yes this is easy 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.729
 So I'm at least compliant 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 can not really do much with that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.670
 because it is so soft from the sun 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 Here it feels nice and soft 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 Of course, you do not buy it cheaply 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.930
 But what uses a cheap brush 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.030
 if I can not do anything with it and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.030
 if you only lose hair 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:16.340
 So that can not be true 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 So as I said a recommendation for the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.910
 Berlin make up and concealer brush on 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.970
 you better a good one so I hope 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.560
 you do not already have it or maybe 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 Are you happy with me? 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.900
 can not imagine it though 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 if so, then let me know and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.400
 you see yourself
