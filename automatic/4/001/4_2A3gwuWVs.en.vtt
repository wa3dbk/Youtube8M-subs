00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.380
 places we are also very simple 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.460
 good before appearing on such 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.530
 . Here's our dough 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.030
 arc flowed capaciously so that it was convenient for you 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.119
 show now here we are here we are 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.310
 turn the apples 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 I just have to be so much to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.619
 virtually no dough was visible 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 mix well then this is all 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.940
 our dough together with apples we 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.160
 pour in greased with vegetable oil 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.599
 I put the baking sheet here see the paper 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.430
 guest foil 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:24.670
 such a mixture we got see 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:29.049
 what a thick and now pour out so 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.870
 exactly all straightened see almost 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.480
 no dough do not worry everything is fine 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.239
 now we send in preheated to 200 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.360
 degrees oven somewhere about 30 minutes 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.400
 at least our pie is ready when your 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 touch it in liquid enough 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:53.250
 hard and so for the crust take the egg 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:58.389
 here is sugar and now is very good 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.150
 white you see white oil here 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:04.209
 it turned out now here we pour out 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 melted butter only not 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.930
 hot again his good 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.349
 now at 30 minutes later I pulled out 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.390
 the oven is our cake and on not fashionable 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.620
 hot straight just pour out the oven 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:35.450
 Here is this mixture that we did 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:45.410
 writing we level everything everywhere 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:48.370
 evenly lay the beauty he overexposure 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.859
 sprinkle with nuts 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:59.109
 nutlet straight so do not regret a lot of nutlet 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.109
 don't fry being delicious so and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:11.030
 now a little more grade and ship to 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:13.250
 the oven is still 15 well our pie is ready 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.709
 the quality of the cake is very much his 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.870
 Appearance depends on the quality of apples 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.780
 because they are more juicy second more 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.180
 dry sour all but its taste is unchanged 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.320
 always invariably you just be 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.720
