to<00:02:41.830> find<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.370> what<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.970> that's<00:02:43.329> going<00:02:43.540> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
to find out what it is that's going to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.259 
to find out what it is that's going to
that's<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.470> evolve<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.760> or<00:02:45.970> take<00:02:46.209> you

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
that's going to evolve you or take you

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.870 
that's going to evolve you or take you
to<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> next<00:02:46.840> level<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.650> what<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> enjoy<00:02:48.670> is

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
to the next level and so what I enjoy is

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.289 
to the next level and so what I enjoy is
the<00:02:49.480> process<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.290> creation<00:02:50.709> where<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:52.060> really

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
the process of creation where you really

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.819 
the process of creation where you really
think<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.690> something<00:02:53.049> that<00:02:53.170> needs<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.620> done

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
think of something that needs to be done

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.830 
think of something that needs to be done
and<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.459> start<00:02:54.760> kind<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.030> solving<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.600> problem

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and you start kind of solving a problem

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
and you start kind of solving a problem
rather<00:02:56.500> than<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:57.010> trying<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.610> draw

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
rather than just trying to draw

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.819 
rather than just trying to draw
something<00:02:58.269> or<00:02:58.570> do<00:02:58.780> something<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> profit

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
something or do something for a profit

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.850 
something or do something for a profit
and<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.480> process<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.140> me<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> creative

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
and so the process for me the creative

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.520 
and so the process for me the creative
process<00:03:03.209> starts<00:03:04.209> out<00:03:04.420> under<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.870> shade<00:03:05.170> tree

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
process starts out under that shade tree

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.970 
process starts out under that shade tree
it's<00:03:05.680> when<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> minute

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
it's when you have a minute

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
it's when you have a minute
so<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.909> I<00:03:08.030> really<00:03:08.510> enjoy<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.349> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
so and I really enjoy that and then and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
so and I really enjoy that and then and
then<00:03:09.680> when<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.129> that<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.519> believe<00:03:10.879> in<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
then when you do that you believe in it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.330 
then when you do that you believe in it
more<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:12.349> don't<00:03:12.530> want<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.830> just<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.099> in

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
more and you don't want to just be in

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.550 
more and you don't want to just be in
the<00:03:13.459> cradle<00:03:13.810> process<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.989> want<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.290> bring<00:03:15.470> it
