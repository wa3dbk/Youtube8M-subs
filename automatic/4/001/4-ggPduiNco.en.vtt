00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
and I'll be saying Eric or what but it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.160 
and I'll be saying Eric or what but it's
it's<00:00:24.210> definitely<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.570> sign<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> he's<00:00:25.019> about

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it's definitely a sign that he's about

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.670 
it's definitely a sign that he's about
to<00:00:25.350> bite<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.939> listen<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.720> when

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to bite and so listen for that when

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
to bite and so listen for that when
you're<00:00:29.039> training<00:00:29.250> might<00:00:29.730> mean<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.939> you're

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you're training might mean that you're

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:48.830 
you're training might mean that you're
pushing<00:00:30.480> too<00:00:30.660> far<00:00:46.969> or<00:00:47.969> Hulme<00:00:48.360> something<00:00:48.750> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
pushing too far or Hulme something that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:00.310 
pushing too far or Hulme something that
he's<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.500> likes<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> wave

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.660 

just<00:01:01.320> rocking<00:01:03.860> pretty<00:01:04.860> excited<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
just rocking pretty excited to be in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
just rocking pretty excited to be in
there<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.650> covers<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
there so I think that about covers it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
there so I think that about covers it
the<00:01:08.549> mean<00:01:08.760> body<00:01:09.090> language<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.840> he<00:01:10.020> displays

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the mean body language that he displays

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.359 
the mean body language that he displays
is<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.380> his<00:01:13.590> head<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
is is really on his head you have to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
is is really on his head you have to
watch<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:15.060> his<00:01:15.420> head<00:01:15.689> aggression<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:52.910 
job and he seems to really response a
lot<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.450> praise<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:51.660> think<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
lot of praise so I think that's about it

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.190 
lot of praise so I think that's about it
other<00:02:53.760> than<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.120> eye<00:02:54.150> pinning<00:02:54.630> which<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.959> can

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
other than the eye pinning which you can

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.199 
other than the eye pinning which you can
obviously<00:02:55.769> realize<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:56.430> that's<00:02:56.639> really<00:02:56.970> not

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
obviously realize but that's really not

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.789 
obviously realize but that's really not
totally<00:02:57.660> fair<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.049> off<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.380> because<00:02:58.650> that's

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
totally fair to go off of because that's

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.099 
totally fair to go off of because that's
just<00:02:59.040> excitement<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.790> hopefully<00:03:00.690> those<00:03:00.810> body
