with kraft music here and check it out
r5<00:00:20.320> now<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:21.589> a<00:00:21.730> amplifier<00:00:22.730> that<00:00:22.939> that

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
r5 now this is a amplifier that that

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.169 
r5 now this is a amplifier that that
really<00:00:24.679> is<00:00:24.919> calling<00:00:25.279> out<00:00:25.429> to<00:00:25.460> me<00:00:25.759> I<00:00:26.060> have

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
really is calling out to me I have

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.999 
really is calling out to me I have
nothing<00:00:26.749> like<00:00:26.899> this<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.439> I've<00:00:27.560> never<00:00:27.769> seen

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
nothing like this and I've never seen

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.769 
nothing like this and I've never seen
anything<00:00:28.220> like<00:00:28.339> this<00:00:28.669> what<00:00:29.210> this<00:00:29.359> is<00:00:29.509> is<00:00:29.659> a

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
anything like this what this is is a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.019 
anything like this what this is is a
it's<00:00:30.019> a<00:00:30.169> still<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.589> modeling<00:00:31.159> amplifier<00:00:31.819> in<00:00:31.939> the

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
it's a still a modeling amplifier in the

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.810 
it's a still a modeling amplifier in the
thr<00:00:32.570> series<00:00:33.289> but<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.190> difference<00:00:34.579> here<00:00:34.789> is

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
thr series but the difference here is

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.750 
thr series but the difference here is
instead<00:00:35.269> of<00:00:35.329> modeling<00:00:36.550> amplifiers<00:00:37.550> were

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
instead of modeling amplifiers were

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.549 
instead of modeling amplifiers were
modeling<00:00:38.210> microphones<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.199> now<00:00:39.410> we're

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
modeling microphones so now we're

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.950 
modeling microphones so now we're
modeling<00:00:39.800> condenser<00:00:40.429> mic<00:00:40.609> the<00:00:41.269> dynamic<00:00:41.780> mic

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
modeling condenser mic the dynamic mic

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.430 
modeling condenser mic the dynamic mic
and<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.620> tube<00:00:42.859> mic<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:44.090> nylon<00:00:44.629> setting<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.410> for

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
and a tube mic the nylon setting is for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.020 
and a tube mic the nylon setting is for
nylon<00:00:45.920> guitars<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.579> still<00:00:46.820> have<00:00:46.940> an

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
nylon guitars and you still have an

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.200 
nylon guitars and you still have an
electric<00:00:47.600> clean<00:00:48.280> patch<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:49.969> go<00:00:50.149> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
electric clean patch that you can go to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.290 
electric clean patch that you can go to
and<00:00:50.929> what<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.609> run<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> pedal<00:00:53.179> through

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
and what and you can run a pedal through

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.910 
and what and you can run a pedal through
that<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.690> still<00:00:53.929> get<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.140> little<00:00:54.260> crazy<00:00:54.620> if<00:00:54.829> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
that and still get a little crazy if you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.349 
that and still get a little crazy if you
wanted<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.519> kind<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:55.999> your

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
wanted to so you kind of have your

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.439 
wanted to so you kind of have your
different<00:00:56.989> variety<00:00:57.739> there<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.210> know<00:00:59.300> if

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
different variety there so you know if

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.419 
different variety there so you know if
you<00:00:59.690> choose<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.019> own<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:00.859> can<00:01:01.159> you're

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
you choose to own this you can you're

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.369 
you choose to own this you can you're
not<00:01:01.460> completely<00:01:02.149> tied<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.690> just<00:01:02.870> acoustic

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
not completely tied to just acoustic

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.670 
not completely tied to just acoustic
guitars<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.910> right<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:05.390> mic<00:01:05.870> and<00:01:06.170> direct

guitars this right here mic and direct
chooses<00:01:07.280> between<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.820> mic<00:01:08.060> modeling<00:01:08.540> or<00:01:08.690> just

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
chooses between the mic modeling or just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.100 
chooses between the mic modeling or just
your<00:01:09.110> direct<00:01:09.500> pickup<00:01:10.160> or<00:01:10.370> piezo<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.960> have

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
your direct pickup or piezo you have

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740 
your direct pickup or piezo you have
master<00:01:12.620> tone<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.790> have<00:01:13.820> compression<00:01:14.600> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
master tone you have compression and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.550 
master tone you have compression and
compression<00:01:15.680> with<00:01:15.980> chorus<00:01:16.520> chorus<00:01:17.450> on<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
compression with chorus chorus on the

compression with chorus chorus on the
effect<00:01:18.890> side<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:20.120> you<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.240> delay<00:01:20.690> delay

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
effect side then you have delay delay

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.650 
effect side then you have delay delay
reverb<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.860> Hall<00:01:22.220> volume<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.330> still<00:01:23.540> have

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
reverb and Hall volume you still have

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.450 
reverb and Hall volume you still have
your<00:01:23.690> auxiliary<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.560> can<00:01:24.710> jam<00:01:25.010> along<00:01:25.280> with

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
your auxiliary so you can jam along with

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.410 
your auxiliary so you can jam along with
tracks<00:01:25.760> and<00:01:26.060> use<00:01:26.330> your<00:01:26.660> thr<00:01:27.500> sessions<00:01:28.010> app<00:01:28.420> if

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
tracks and use your thr sessions app if

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.630 
tracks and use your thr sessions app if
you<00:01:29.540> want<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.780> learn<00:01:29.960> stuff<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.500> yeah<00:01:31.490> it's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
you want to learn stuff and yeah it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.250 
you want to learn stuff and yeah it's
you<00:01:31.850> have<00:01:31.940> headphones<00:01:32.150> out<00:01:32.510> input<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.170> you

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
you have headphones out input and you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.770 
you have headphones out input and you
can<00:01:33.410> still<00:01:33.620> record<00:01:33.950> via<00:01:34.280> USB<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.450> Cubase

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
can still record via USB with the Cubase

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.670 
can still record via USB with the Cubase
AI<00:01:35.930> 6<00:01:36.800> now<00:01:37.570> this<00:01:38.570> amplifier<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:38.990> very<00:01:39.200> cool

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
AI 6 now this amplifier is very cool

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.580 
AI 6 now this amplifier is very cool
because<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.920> does<00:01:40.100> audio<00:01:40.460> as<00:01:40.670> well

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
because it does audio as well

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.399 
because it does audio as well
and<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.880> know<00:01:43.000> if<00:01:43.329> you're<00:01:43.600> traveling<00:01:44.140> with

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
and so you know if you're traveling with

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.050 
and so you know if you're traveling with
something<00:01:45.040> like<00:01:45.159> let's<00:01:45.369> say<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.640> traveler

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
something like let's say this traveler

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.539 
something like let's say this traveler
guitar<00:01:46.360> which<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.140> silent<00:01:47.590> guitar<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.100> 110

s and you traveling with this imagine
this<00:01:51.759> is<00:01:51.939> your<00:01:52.360> entire<00:01:52.750> little<00:01:53.229> rig<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
this is your entire little rig to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.130 
this is your entire little rig to
practice<00:01:54.430> or<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:55.000> actually<00:01:55.390> perform<00:01:55.750> drop<00:01:56.110> a

mic in front of it and doing a nice
little<00:01:58.000> acoustic<00:01:58.929> cave<00:01:59.289> with<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.100> I'm

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
little acoustic cave with it so I'm

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:12.230 
little acoustic cave with it so I'm
gonna<00:02:00.520> give<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:01.030> little<00:02:01.149> couple<00:02:01.479> sound

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.650 

now<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:14.070> type<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> modeling<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
now the type of modeling that we have is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320 
now the type of modeling that we have is
here<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.930> Yamahas<00:02:16.470> proprietary<00:02:17.130> BCM<00:02:17.880> which
