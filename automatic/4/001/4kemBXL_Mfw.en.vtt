like<00:02:06.509> Tiger<00:02:06.840> Woods<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> little<00:02:07.500> more

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
like Tiger Woods there's a little more

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
like Tiger Woods there's a little more
neutral<00:02:07.860> where<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> V<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.479> pointing

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
neutral where the V here is pointing

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900 
neutral where the V here is pointing
more<00:02:10.020> towards<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> right<00:02:10.440> ear<00:02:10.830> we'll<00:02:11.670> look

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
more towards the right ear we'll look

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.240 
more towards the right ear we'll look
just<00:02:12.270> ever<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.050> slightly

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
just ever so slightly

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.730 
and that clubface is square at the top
and<00:02:17.690> then<00:02:18.690> somebody<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.170> Freddie<00:02:19.470> couples

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
and then somebody like Freddie couples

inside joke as golf instructors that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.420 
inside joke as golf instructors that
most<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.240> our<00:03:03.300> business<00:03:03.690> comes<00:03:03.960> from<00:03:04.430> friends

most of our business comes from friends
helping<00:03:05.730> friends<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.270> play<00:03:06.510> golf<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.140> a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
helping friends how to play golf and a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.350 
helping friends how to play golf and a
lot<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.950> times<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.550> misunderstanding<00:03:09.300> of

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
lot of times it's a misunderstanding of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.470 
lot of times it's a misunderstanding of
the<00:03:09.420> left<00:03:09.660> wrist<00:03:09.870> position<00:03:10.340> leads<00:03:11.340> us<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.910> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the left wrist position leads us to to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.970 
the left wrist position leads us to to
getting<00:03:12.660> some<00:03:12.870> more<00:03:12.990> golf<00:03:13.170> lessons<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
getting some more golf lessons and the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.430 
getting some more golf lessons and the
reason<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:15.330> friend<00:03:15.660> tells<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.230> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
reason is if your friend tells you to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.260 
reason is if your friend tells you to
just<00:03:16.650> do<00:03:16.800> something<00:03:17.100> because<00:03:17.370> Tiger<00:03:17.880> does<00:03:18.090> it

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
just do something because Tiger does it

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.270 
just do something because Tiger does it
or<00:03:18.390> because<00:03:18.690> Hogan<00:03:19.080> does<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.470> they're<00:03:20.100> not

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
or because Hogan does it they're not

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
or because Hogan does it they're not
necessarily<00:03:20.910> understanding<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
necessarily understanding the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.960 
necessarily understanding the
relationship<00:03:22.739> between<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.250> piece<00:03:23.790> of

impact<00:03:33.170> my<00:03:34.170> philosophy<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.010> teaching<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.610> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
impact my philosophy of teaching is to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.880 
impact my philosophy of teaching is to
make<00:03:35.940> sure<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.660> my<00:03:37.200> students<00:03:37.680> leave<00:03:37.860> with

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
make sure that my students leave with

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.740 
make sure that my students leave with
the<00:03:38.160> correct<00:03:38.520> impact<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.239> their<00:03:39.390> desired

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the correct impact and their desired

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.530 
the correct impact and their desired
ball<00:03:40.020> flight<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.430> let's<00:03:41.640> talk<00:03:41.850> about<00:03:42.180> how<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
ball flight so let's talk about how the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.750 
ball flight so let's talk about how the
position<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.320> left<00:03:43.500> wrist<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.160> going<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
position of the left wrist is going to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.620 
position of the left wrist is going to
affect<00:03:45.060> impact<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> neutral<00:03:48.360> grip

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
affect impact if I have a neutral grip

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.500 
affect impact if I have a neutral grip
so<00:03:49.590> maybe<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.070> slight<00:03:50.459> cup<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.880> my<00:03:50.910> left<00:03:51.209> wrist

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
so maybe a slight cup in my left wrist

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.610 
so maybe a slight cup in my left wrist
if<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.470> decide<00:03:52.920> from<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:54.269> then<00:03:54.450> bow<00:03:55.290> out

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
if I decide from there to then bow out

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.830 
if I decide from there to then bow out
my<00:03:55.890> left<00:03:56.160> wrist<00:03:56.459> or<00:03:56.790> flatten<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:57.390> out<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.720> you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
my left wrist or flatten it out if you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.660 
my left wrist or flatten it out if you
will<00:03:58.050> because<00:03:58.530> that's<00:03:58.650> what<00:03:58.890> Tiger<00:03:59.070> does<00:03:59.400> I

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
will because that's what Tiger does I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.860 
will because that's what Tiger does I
have<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.830> shut<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.070> clubface<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.880> hit<00:04:03.840> a
