00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 

the<00:01:36.360> grizzly<00:01:36.750> bear<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.050> probably<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> most

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the grizzly bear is probably the most

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
the grizzly bear is probably the most
dangerous<00:01:37.860> land<00:01:38.370> animal<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.880> North<00:01:39.090> America

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
dangerous land animal in North America

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:50.200 
dangerous land animal in North America
it<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:39.900> readily<00:01:40.260> attack<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.950> disturbed

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.540 

okay<00:01:51.050> what<00:01:51.350> do<00:01:51.410> we<00:01:51.500> go<00:01:51.620> up<00:01:53.830> grizzly<00:01:54.830> bad<00:01:57.550> block

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
okay what do we go up grizzly bad block

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
bad shape alright I'm guessing that this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.910 
bad shape alright I'm guessing that this
holy<00:02:11.720> shit<00:02:14.560> that's<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.709> damn<00:02:16.010> small<00:02:16.459> knot<00:02:17.920> wow

holy shit that's a damn small knot wow

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
holy shit that's a damn small knot wow
this<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.820> gonna<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.150> quite<00:02:21.080> hard<00:02:23.350> right

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.170 

but<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.350> did<00:02:35.560> say<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.130> anyone<00:02:36.490> could<00:02:36.670> make<00:02:36.880> any

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
but I did say that anyone could make any

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:48.840 
but I did say that anyone could make any
request<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.870> wanted<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.410> say<00:02:39.690> yeah<00:02:47.610> as<00:02:48.610> I've

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
request I wanted to say yeah as I've

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.610 
request I wanted to say yeah as I've
said<00:02:49.060> before<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.420> can't<00:02:49.780> he<00:02:49.930> when<00:02:50.110> something's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
said before I can't he when something's

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.420 
said before I can't he when something's
approaching<00:02:50.770> me<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.430> I'm<00:02:51.520> probably<00:02:51.640> gonna<00:02:51.880> get

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
approaching me so I'm probably gonna get

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.580 
approaching me so I'm probably gonna get
shot<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.580> back<00:02:54.670> body<00:02:55.210> up<00:02:55.600> there<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.440> we

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
shot in the back body up there and I we

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
shot in the back body up there and I we
have<00:02:56.980> no<00:02:57.310> idea<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.120> behind<00:02:58.570> me<00:03:02.970> no<00:03:03.970> well

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
have no idea that it's behind me no well

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.460 
have no idea that it's behind me no well
I<00:03:04.390> suppose<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.050> adds<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.380> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
I suppose it just adds to the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:16.460 
I suppose it just adds to the
entertainment<00:03:06.250> factor

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.420
