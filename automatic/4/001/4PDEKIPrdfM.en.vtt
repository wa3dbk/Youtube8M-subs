00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
it's one terabyte that has to go through

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.070 
it's one terabyte that has to go through
unless<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:18.989> maybe<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.680> movie<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.280> it

up<00:04:27.030> now<00:04:28.030> if<00:04:28.390> you<00:04:28.810> get<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.020> say<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.920> 300<00:04:30.610> gig<00:04:30.850> oh

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
up now if you get a say a 300 gig oh

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.130 
up now if you get a say a 300 gig oh
this<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.950> Western<00:04:33.250> Digital<00:04:33.580> too<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.930> if<00:04:35.050> you

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
this is Western Digital too so if you

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.860 
this is Western Digital too so if you
have<00:04:35.260> 300<00:04:35.800> gig<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.730> startup<00:04:37.090> time<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.630> lot

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
have 300 gig the startup time is a lot

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.990 
have 300 gig the startup time is a lot
less<00:04:38.280> okay<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.480> get<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.970> this

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
less okay and then if you get like this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.540 
less okay and then if you get like this
I<00:04:43.900> think<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.740> an<00:04:44.980> 80<00:04:45.250> gig<00:04:45.900> hard<00:04:46.900> drive<00:04:49.320> it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
I think this is an 80 gig hard drive it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.500 
I think this is an 80 gig hard drive it
starts<00:04:51.550> up<00:04:51.640> really<00:04:51.940> fast<00:04:52.380> so<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.940> can<00:04:55.150> even

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
starts up really fast so you can even

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.480 
starts up really fast so you can even
get<00:04:55.830> if<00:04:56.830> you're<00:04:56.980> just<00:04:57.070> going<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.310> put<00:04:57.460> one

lot of times this is what I'll do and
you<00:05:34.180> know<00:05:34.330> thumb<00:05:34.960> drives<00:05:35.230> like<00:05:35.380> this<00:05:35.850> same

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
you know thumb drives like this same

startup time is like this really fast

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.140 
startup time is like this really fast
this<00:05:42.870> could<00:05:43.870> take<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.410> minute<00:05:45.340> two<00:05:45.550> minutes<00:05:45.910> for

this could take a minute two minutes for

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.290 
this could take a minute two minutes for
it<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.530> do<00:05:47.530> its<00:05:47.560> can't<00:05:48.130> and<00:05:48.430> pop<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:48.940> up<00:05:49.120> is

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
it to do its can't and pop it up is

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.090 
it to do its can't and pop it up is
ready<00:05:49.510> so<00:05:50.410> that's<00:05:50.620> something<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.860> think<00:05:50.920> about

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
ready so that's something to think about

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.090 
ready so that's something to think about
too<00:05:51.630> if<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.780> get<00:05:52.930> one<00:05:53.050> of<00:05:53.170> these<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.920> might

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
too if you get one of these you might

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.370 
too if you get one of these you might
want<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.340> consider<00:05:54.550> getting<00:05:54.850> a<00:05:55.260> start<00:05:56.260> off

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
want to consider getting a start off

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.440 
want to consider getting a start off
with<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.620> smaller<00:05:56.890> hard<00:05:57.190> drive<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:58.300> other

with a smaller hard drive the other
thing<00:05:58.630> about<00:05:58.780> these<00:05:58.900> hard<00:05:59.140> drives<00:05:59.290> is<00:06:01.110> hard

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
thing about these hard drives is hard

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.400 
thing about these hard drives is hard
drives<00:06:02.320> like<00:06:02.470> this<00:06:03.750> don't<00:06:04.750> require<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.110> power

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
drives like this don't require a power

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.310 
drives like this don't require a power
cable<00:06:06.060> so<00:06:07.060> when<00:06:07.330> you're<00:06:07.480> you<00:06:07.750> know<00:06:07.870> you're<00:06:08.080> at

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
suggest while the bigger hard drives are

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.850 
suggest while the bigger hard drives are
less<00:06:33.910> expensive<00:06:34.510> and<00:06:35.580> um<00:06:36.900> you<00:06:37.900> know

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
less expensive and um you know

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.520 
less expensive and um you know
they're<00:06:39.819> just<00:06:40.000> more<00:06:40.150> cumbersome<00:06:40.810> you<00:06:41.409> know

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
they're just more cumbersome you know

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.020 
they're just more cumbersome you know
you<00:06:41.860> don't<00:06:42.310> want<00:06:42.659> this<00:06:43.659> is<00:06:43.870> supposed<00:06:44.229> to<00:06:45.030> make

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
you don't want this is supposed to make

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.510 
you don't want this is supposed to make
it<00:06:46.210> easier<00:06:46.629> to<00:06:46.870> view<00:06:47.139> videos<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.129> stuff<00:06:48.280> on

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
it easier to view videos and stuff on

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.300 
it easier to view videos and stuff on
your<00:06:48.639> TV<00:06:48.879> and<00:06:49.270> I<00:06:50.139> like<00:06:50.409> the<00:06:50.439> idea<00:06:50.650> not<00:06:51.009> having<00:06:51.250> a

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
your TV and I like the idea not having a

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.399 
your TV and I like the idea not having a
power<00:06:51.520> cable<00:06:51.789> so<00:06:52.300> that's<00:06:53.229> why<00:06:53.379> I<00:06:53.409> get<00:06:55.409> these

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
power cable so that's why I get these

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.950 
power cable so that's why I get these
right<00:06:56.620> here<00:06:56.680> and<00:06:57.219> I<00:06:57.340> really<00:06:57.699> I<00:06:57.909> can<00:06:58.689> deal<00:06:58.810> with

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
right here and I really I can deal with

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.709 
right here and I really I can deal with
the<00:06:59.050> startup<00:06:59.409> time<00:06:59.590> so<00:07:00.090> if<00:07:01.090> it's<00:07:01.419> a<00:07:01.479> movie<00:07:01.689> I

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
the startup time so if it's a movie I

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.270 
the startup time so if it's a movie I
want<00:07:01.930> to<00:07:01.990> keep<00:07:02.139> for<00:07:02.409> a<00:07:02.439> long<00:07:02.500> time<00:07:02.800> I<00:07:03.009> just
