at<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.369> isn't<00:02:00.500> once<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
at first but it really isn't once you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.330 
at first but it really isn't once you
actually<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> figure<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:04.100> look<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually kind of figure out look at the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually kind of figure out look at the
it<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:05.790> start<00:02:06.060> by<00:02:06.180> looking<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it will let's start by looking at the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.040 
it will let's start by looking at the
attachments<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.680> opinion<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.629> when<00:02:09.629> using<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
attachments my opinion is when using a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.650 
attachments my opinion is when using a
reflex<00:02:10.560> when<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.310> using<00:02:11.520> an<00:02:11.730> attachment<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
reflex when not using an attachment the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
reflex when not using an attachment the
stratus<00:02:13.200> better<00:02:13.410> when

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
stratus better when

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.429 
stratus better when
using<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.250> reflex<00:02:14.700> sight<00:02:14.909> stratus<00:02:15.569> better<00:02:15.840> when

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
using a reflex sight stratus better when

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.979 
using a reflex sight stratus better when
using<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.830> laser<00:02:17.010> or<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.549> cog<00:02:17.939> Stratos<00:02:18.780> better

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
using a laser or a cog Stratos better

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.020 
using a laser or a cog Stratos better
the<00:02:19.290> only<00:02:19.530> time<00:02:19.709> I'd<00:02:19.920> say<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.280> iron<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.760> better

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the only time I'd say the iron is better

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.860 
the only time I'd say the iron is better
is<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.750> you're<00:02:22.110> using<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.829> silencer<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
is if you're using a silencer but if you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
is if you're using a silencer but if you
are<00:02:25.019> using<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.379> silencer<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.010> I've<00:02:26.099> on<00:02:26.310> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
are using a silencer on the I've on it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.710 
are using a silencer on the I've on it
makes<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.329> absolutely<00:02:27.829> godly<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.720> science

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
makes it absolutely godly and science

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.080 
makes it absolutely godly and science
are<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> stretcher<00:02:31.349> on<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.709> other<00:02:31.829> hand

kind<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.209> sucks<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.599> on<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.680> note<00:02:37.849> I'm

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
kind of sucks and so on that note I'm

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.990 
kind of sucks and so on that note I'm
gonna<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> go<00:02:39.540> strata<00:02:40.109> there<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.849> for<00:02:41.849> how

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
gonna have to go strata there as for how

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.920 
gonna have to go strata there as for how
it<00:02:42.150> kind<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.359> performs<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.079> game<00:02:44.480> if<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.629> stick

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it kind of performs in game if you stick

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.229 
it kind of performs in game if you stick
a<00:02:46.109> laser<00:02:46.409> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.769> strata<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.700> couple<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.180> with

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
a laser on the strata and couple it with

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.720 
a laser on the strata and couple it with
a<00:02:48.390> snapshot<00:02:49.379> then<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.670> be

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
a snapshot then that's going to be

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.119 
a snapshot then that's going to be
absolutely<00:02:51.030> deadly<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.379> you'll<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
absolutely deadly but you'll get the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.080 
absolutely deadly but you'll get the
same<00:02:53.370> result<00:02:53.609> if<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:55.049> science<00:02:55.470> ivana

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
same result if you have a science ivana

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.319 
same result if you have a science ivana

but<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.190> relevant<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.639> this<00:03:14.760> because<00:03:15.000> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
but it's relevant to this because you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940 
but it's relevant to this because you
can<00:03:15.209> see<00:03:15.389> I'm<00:03:15.510> using<00:03:15.540> them<00:03:16.019> both<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.650> decide

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
can see I'm using them both and I decide

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.559 
can see I'm using them both and I decide
to<00:03:16.980> go<00:03:17.220> over<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.519> attachment<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> Ivana

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
to go over the attachment on the Ivana

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.589 
to go over the attachment on the Ivana
because<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.049> needs<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.859> because<00:03:20.430> my<00:03:21.299> I'll

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
because it needs it more because my I'll

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.659 
because it needs it more because my I'll
tell<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.959> right<00:03:21.989> now<00:03:22.109> my<00:03:22.530> opinion<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
tell you right now my opinion is the

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.569 
tell you right now my opinion is the
Stratos<00:03:24.480> better<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.709> lot<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:25.919> people<00:03:26.129> will

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
Stratos better and a lot of people will

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.119 
Stratos better and a lot of people will
agree<00:03:26.669> with<00:03:26.879> me<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.419> lot<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.599> people<00:03:27.780> won't<00:03:28.129> but

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
agree with me a lot of people won't but

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.939 
agree with me a lot of people won't but
I<00:03:29.220> think<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.879> my<00:03:30.329> personal<00:03:30.840> opinion<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
I think that my personal opinion is that

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.220 
I think that my personal opinion is that
Stratos<00:03:32.699> better<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.329> year<00:03:33.449> and<00:03:33.629> have<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:34.019> go

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
Stratos better the year and have to go

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.309 
Stratos better the year and have to go
with<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.829> want<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
with that if you don't want to and the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.289 
with that if you don't want to and the
guys<00:03:37.500> say<00:03:37.829> if<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.160> use<00:03:38.400> an<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.760> cult<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
guys say if you use an a cult on the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.539 
guys say if you use an a cult on the
I've<00:03:39.419> on<00:03:39.599> it<00:03:39.780> you'll<00:03:39.930> realize<00:03:40.099> they<00:03:41.099> actually

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
I've on it you'll realize they actually

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.689 
I've on it you'll realize they actually
does<00:03:41.699> have<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> fair<00:03:42.209> bit<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.389> recoil<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
does have a fair bit of recoil on it

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.920 
does have a fair bit of recoil on it
trying<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:44.760> kill<00:03:45.000> someone<00:03:45.239> across<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.720> map

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
trying to kill someone across the map

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.909 
trying to kill someone across the map
with<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.230> Ivana<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.709> actually<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:47.699> easy

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
with the Ivana is actually not that easy

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.629 
with the Ivana is actually not that easy
and<00:03:49.919> can<00:03:50.480> quite<00:03:51.480> often<00:03:51.660> fail<00:03:52.139> but<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.400> would

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
and can quite often fail but that would

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.920 
and can quite often fail but that would
not<00:03:53.669> normally<00:03:54.209> happen<00:03:54.720> with<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> stressor

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.580 

so<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.500> pretty<00:04:00.340> much<00:04:01.330> all<00:04:01.989> I've<00:04:02.379> gotta

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
so that is pretty much all I've gotta

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.190 
so that is pretty much all I've gotta
say<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.040> note<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.299> just<00:04:04.780> go<00:04:04.930> over<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
what you think about the earth this

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.620 
what you think about the earth this
other<00:04:21.160> discussion<00:04:21.850> whether<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.240> think<00:04:22.449> the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
other discussion whether you think the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.860 
other discussion whether you think the
strata<00:04:22.960> is<00:04:23.139> better<00:04:23.350> than<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> ivana

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
strata is better than the ivana

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.920 
strata is better than the ivana
obviously<00:04:25.870> might<00:04:26.080> like<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.470> said<00:04:26.740> in<00:04:27.040> my

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
obviously might like I said in my

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.100 
obviously might like I said in my
personal<00:04:28.930> point<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.470> view<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:29.949> the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
personal point of view is that the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.390 
personal point of view is that the
Stratos<00:04:32.110> better<00:04:32.350> see<00:04:33.250> they're<00:04:33.699> showing<00:04:34.570> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
Stratos better see they're showing you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.629 
Stratos better see they're showing you
how<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.580> hinders<00:04:37.150> long<00:04:38.139> range<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.100> that's<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
how it hinders long range and that's the

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.340 
how it hinders long range and that's the
main<00:04:39.850> reason<00:04:39.880> why<00:04:40.479> i<00:04:40.510> think<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.930> Stratos

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
main reason why i think the Stratos

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.610 
main reason why i think the Stratos
better<00:04:41.590> because<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:43.449> ivana<00:04:43.810> just<00:04:44.169> can't<00:04:44.410> get

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
better because the ivana just can't get

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.800 
better because the ivana just can't get
those<00:04:44.860> kills<00:04:45.160> at<00:04:45.340> long<00:04:45.520> range<00:04:45.820> I'd<00:04:46.060> strata<00:04:46.479> can

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
those kills at long range I'd strata can

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.900 
those kills at long range I'd strata can
and<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.440> I've<00:04:47.560> honest<00:04:47.949> is<00:04:48.070> supposed<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.520> be<00:04:48.639> a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
and the I've honest is supposed to be a

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.490 
and the I've honest is supposed to be a
salt<00:04:49.600> rifle<00:04:50.139> see<00:04:50.949> that<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.970> take<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.419> guy<00:04:52.630> no

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
salt rifle see that can take that guy no

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.250 
salt rifle see that can take that guy no
way<00:04:53.740> can<00:04:54.010> take<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.430> guy<00:04:54.639> so<00:04:54.910> again<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:55.840> but

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
way can take that guy so again there but

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.810 
way can take that guy so again there but
it<00:04:56.740> would<00:04:56.860> have<00:04:56.949> been<00:04:57.039> nice<00:04:57.250> it's<00:04:57.460> getting<00:04:57.729> the
