 [Music] 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.400
 for the second year in a row, the prepared 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.760
 enemy are in for the winter break 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.320
 marbella 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.380
 why do you have marbella again 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 chosen because here the facilities 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.120
 ideal and the circumstances 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 it is the perfect training field that is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.809
 of course the most important thing 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.590
 it looks like a billiard table, which is quite 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.780
 well maintained 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.790
 well the weather is good you are actually 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 assured of great weather it is so 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.530
 I think around 20 degrees 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.620
 sun there so that had it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.039
 circumstances are good 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.039

 [Music] 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 I always think it's a fairly quiet week 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.539
 for me it is important I think 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.490
 in order to very briefly on our technical 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.960
 medical staff and and our player group too 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.909
 sit on weekdays 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.289
 you arrive in a normal in Rotterdam 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.509
 not to that then I have so much 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.789
 consult and so many appointments and then 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.980
 I am already happy that I have a training in the 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:02:01.319
 one week every two weeks 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:02:01.319
 [Music] 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.520
 you are injured and you make it fall 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.190
 a little bit outside of the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.330
 outside the boat and then it is again 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.770
 great that you just for the winter break 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.390
 again a few games have been able to join 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 do it and then you can enjoy it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.510
 training camp 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.720

 a week to train well and yes 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.840
 interacting with each other outside training 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.010
 go with the it's very good animals 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.440
 we treat each other well 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 socialize easily with each other 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.070
 but no, dare something 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.900
 magnet or philosopher international matches behind 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.250
 namely standing or just a newcomer 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.330
 talk of doing 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.950
 already sees that the real a team 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.960
 becoming and hopefully results 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.960
 also pay attention to good transfer results 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.540

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.560

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.620
 our staff is present here 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.750
 and then such an operation you have to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.459
 to monitor 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.709
