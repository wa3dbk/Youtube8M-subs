00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
here's a quick video showing you how to

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.179 
here's a quick video showing you how to
access<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.570> DNA<00:00:03.720> wires<00:00:04.310> in<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> end<00:00:05.520> 63<00:00:07.189> this

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
access the DNA wires in the end 63 this

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.190 
access the DNA wires in the end 63 this
one<00:00:08.400> already<00:00:08.639> has<00:00:08.910> these<00:00:09.300> stage<00:00:09.570> 2<00:00:09.780> installed

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.780 

you'll<00:00:13.200> see<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.559> here<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.580> thing<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
you'll see it in here but first thing to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
you'll see it in here but first thing to
pop<00:00:15.000> off<00:00:15.210> discovered<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:16.170> gives<00:00:16.410> us<00:00:16.470> access

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
pop off discovered which gives us access

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.279 
pop off discovered which gives us access
to<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.130> ECU<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.840> stage<00:00:19.080> 2

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
to the ECU here these are the stage 2

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
to the ECU here these are the stage 2
wires<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:19.710> already<00:00:19.949> installed<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
wires I've already installed here and to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.790 
wires I've already installed here and to
put<00:00:21.570> those<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.869> we're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.230> pop<00:00:22.410> off<00:00:22.560> each

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
put those in we're going to pop off each

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.730 
put those in we're going to pop off each
of<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.010> 4<00:00:23.340> sub<00:00:23.910> connectors<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> first

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of these 4 sub connectors the first

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
of these 4 sub connectors the first
thing<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> come<00:00:26.970> off<00:00:27.060> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
thing you do is they have to come off in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
thing you do is they have to come off in
order<00:00:27.480> from<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.109> front<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> back<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
order from the front to the back you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.350 
order from the front to the back you
push<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> tab<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.410> pops<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.250> off<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
push the tab in and that pops it off of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.520 
push the tab in and that pops it off of
course<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.960> sure<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.260> take<00:00:34.410> your

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
course make sure you just take your

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.270 
course make sure you just take your
battery<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:34.920> before<00:00:35.160> doing<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:37.160> just<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
battery first before doing this just a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.750 
battery first before doing this just a
fall<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.969> off<00:00:45.800> like<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> you'll

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fall for them off like that and you'll

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.979 
fall for them off like that and you'll
see<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.000> each<00:00:48.120> use<00:00:48.149> completely<00:00:48.660> exposed

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
see they each use completely exposed

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
see they each use completely exposed
down<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:50.780> now<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.350> only<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.710> insert<00:00:52.980> wires

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
down there now we only do insert wires

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.420 
down there now we only do insert wires
on<00:00:53.520> two<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> connectors<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> we'll<00:00:56.190> start

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
on two of the connectors so we'll start

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.700 
on two of the connectors so we'll start
with<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.480> great<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.620> as

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with this this great one here as good as

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
with this this great one here as good as
any<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.489> they're<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> tricky<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.020> take

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
any and they're kind of tricky to take

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
any and they're kind of tricky to take
apart<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:02.190> why<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.399> wanted<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
apart that's why we wanted to make this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
apart that's why we wanted to make this
video<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> guys<00:01:03.650> but<00:01:04.650> you'll<00:01:04.830> notice

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
video for you guys but you'll notice

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450 
video for you guys but you'll notice
that<00:01:05.129> over<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:08.159> groups

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that over here there's two groups

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
that over here there's two groups
there's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> connector<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.720> two

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
there's a connector that has two

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
there's a connector that has two
connectors<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.070> someone<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.460> be

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
connectors and one that someone will be

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
connectors and one that someone will be
removing<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.409> has

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
removing and there's one here that has

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.719 
removing and there's one here that has
just<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.860> single<00:01:13.890> connector<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> one's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
just a single connector and that one's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.170 
just a single connector and that one's
gonna<00:01:14.850> stay<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.150> place<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.580> way<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
gonna stay in place so the way I do this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
gonna stay in place so the way I do this
is<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.479> sort<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> put<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.439> forefinger<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
is I sort of put my my forefinger on the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
is I sort of put my my forefinger on the
wires<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.330> provide<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:21.780> tension<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
wires here to provide some tension and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.490 
wires here to provide some tension and
then<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.490> use<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> screwdriver<00:01:23.939> sort<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
then you can use a screwdriver sort of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.170 
then you can use a screwdriver sort of
gently<00:01:25.500> bang<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> way<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
gently bang that out of the way and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
gently bang that out of the way and
you'll<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.360> how<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.570> sliding<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.369> now

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you'll see how it's sliding out here now

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
you'll see how it's sliding out here now
ours<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:29.939> been<00:01:29.970> added<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> few<00:01:30.630> times<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
ours has been added a few times so it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
ours has been added a few times so it's
a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.579> first<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
a little easy to do the first time you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.130 
a little easy to do the first time you
do<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.750> may<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:35.340> also

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
do this but you may have to do is also

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.300 
do this but you may have to do is also
use<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.259> screwdriver<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.860> release<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
use your screwdriver to release this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.219 
use your screwdriver to release this
clip<00:01:38.610> back<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:40.110> why<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.409> ever<00:01:40.530> one

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
clip back here because why was ever one

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.270 
clip back here because why was ever one
that<00:01:43.229> pushes<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that pushes in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
that pushes in
so<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.640> you're<00:01:45.079> applying<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> tension<00:01:46.710> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so as you're applying the tension here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
so as you're applying the tension here
you<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.060> push<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.630> clip<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you would then push this clip in and you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.940 
you would then push this clip in and you
could<00:01:49.950> push<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> whole<00:01:50.549> self<00:01:51.299> assembly<00:01:51.630> out

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
could push the whole self assembly out

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.109 
could push the whole self assembly out
just<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:55.040> once<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.610> then

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
just like that so once this is out then

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.459 
just like that so once this is out then
these<00:01:57.360> two<00:01:57.689> you'll<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.049> slide<00:01:58.439> right

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
these two you'll see just slide right

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.080 
these two you'll see just slide right
apart<00:01:59.719> and<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.790> we're<00:02:02.909> gonna<00:02:03.000> use

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
apart and the one that we're gonna use

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
apart and the one that we're gonna use
to<00:02:03.420> assault<00:02:03.689> two<00:02:03.930> wires<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
to assault two wires you can see that I

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.770 
to assault two wires you can see that I
have<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> green<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.909> black<00:02:06.149> looms<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
have the green the black looms from the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
have the green the black looms from the
day<00:02:06.899> before<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:08.239> looks<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.599> one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
day before here is looks like this one

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.320 
day before here is looks like this one
and<00:02:10.050> there's<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.039> numbers<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.120> can

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and there's little numbers here so I can

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
and there's little numbers here so I can
find<00:02:12.569> them

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
find them

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
find them
this<00:02:13.500> 46<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.340> end<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.760> 39<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> other

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
this 46 on one end and 39 on the other

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.170 
this 46 on one end and 39 on the other
and<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:17.280> Installer<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and the Installer I don't have the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.610 
and the Installer I don't have the
actual<00:02:18.300> wiring<00:02:18.660> position<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.260> reference

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
actual wiring position that reference

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.670 
actual wiring position that reference
photos<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:21.270> basically<00:02:21.630> once<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.320> have<00:02:22.530> this

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
photos but basically once you have this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650 
photos but basically once you have this
out<00:02:22.950> I'm<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.120> ahead<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.360> take

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
out I'm going to just go ahead and take

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
out I'm going to just go ahead and take
out<00:02:25.010> our<00:02:26.010> wires<00:02:26.310> an<00:02:26.550> example<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.970> show<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.090> how

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
out our wires an example to show you how

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.550 
out our wires an example to show you how
they<00:02:27.270> come<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.600> out<00:02:27.690> they'll<00:02:28.410> use<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
they come in and out they'll use a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.830 
they come in and out they'll use a
little<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:29.310> using<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.640> little<00:02:29.840> screwdriver

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
little I'm using a little screwdriver

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.140 
little I'm using a little screwdriver
here<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.680> use<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.830> nail<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.310> pen<00:02:32.490> or<00:02:32.700> something

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
here do use a nail or a pen or something

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
here do use a nail or a pen or something
push<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> tab<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.550> buyer

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
push the tab in here and then the buyer

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.190 
push the tab in here and then the buyer
pops<00:02:35.970> right<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:39.840> you'll<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.080> is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
pops right out and what you'll do is

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
pops right out and what you'll do is
you'll<00:02:40.350> plug<00:02:40.590> under<00:02:41.400> tape<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.210> ours<00:02:43.790> done

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you'll plug under tape here on ours done

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.090 
you'll plug under tape here on ours done
tape<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.180> guess<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.110> yeah<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
tape it I guess so yeah and that in the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.820 
tape it I guess so yeah and that in the
video<00:02:47.720> I'd<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.960> use<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.170> blue<00:02:49.440> masking

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
video I'd like to use this blue masking

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.200 
video I'd like to use this blue masking
tape<00:02:49.980> because<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.310> comes<00:02:50.430> off<00:02:50.610> pretty<00:02:50.640> easily

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
tape because it comes off pretty easily

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.490 
tape because it comes off pretty easily
doesn't<00:02:51.600> even<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:51.990> residue<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
doesn't even you kind of residue on the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.200 
doesn't even you kind of residue on the
wires<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.790> holds<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> wire<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.630> place

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
wires and it holds the wire in place

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.190 
wires and it holds the wire in place
you'll<00:02:57.210> see<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.720> wire<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.930> was

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you'll see this is the wire that was

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.840 
you'll see this is the wire that was
originally<00:02:58.530> extracted<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.580> give<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.820> a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
originally extracted we give you a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.470 
originally extracted we give you a
corresponding<00:03:00.510> male<00:03:00.630> pin<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:01.890> plugs<00:03:02.190> in

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
corresponding male pin and that plugs in

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.450 
corresponding male pin and that plugs in
just<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.630> that

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
just like that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.680 
just like that
so<00:03:05.460> you're<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.820> do<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.330> one<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
so you're going to do it on this one and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
so you're going to do it on this one and
let<00:03:06.780> me<00:03:06.840> pop<00:03:07.020> apart<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> other<00:03:07.710> connector<00:03:08.100> so

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
let me pop apart the other connector so

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.000 
let me pop apart the other connector so
you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> reference<00:03:10.010> well

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
you can have it as a reference well

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580 
you can have it as a reference well
first<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.460> this<00:03:11.550> one<00:03:11.640> back<00:03:11.760> together<00:03:12.590> so

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
first up on this one back together so

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.560 
first up on this one back together so
this<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.280> slides<00:03:14.640> back<00:03:14.940> into<00:03:15.020> here<00:03:16.020> like

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
this just slides back into here like

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.890 
this just slides back into here like
that

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
that

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.670 
that
just<00:03:19.650> slides<00:03:19.950> right<00:03:20.190> back<00:03:20.250> into<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.060> housing

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
just slides right back into the housing

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.810 
just slides right back into the housing
that's<00:03:22.680> back<00:03:22.890> into<00:03:23.070> place<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.870> black<00:03:25.080> one

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
that's back into place so this black one

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.250 
that's back into place so this black one
is<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.970> second<00:03:27.300> one<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> I'll<00:03:27.780> repeat<00:03:28.110> this

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
is the second one and I'll repeat this

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.130 
is the second one and I'll repeat this
process<00:03:28.970> where<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.060> sort<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.360> put<00:03:30.750> tension<00:03:30.930> on

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
process where I sort of put tension on

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
process where I sort of put tension on
the<00:03:31.230> wires<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:32.250> loosen<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.820> connector<00:03:34.160> slide

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the wires and loosen the connector slide

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.270 
the wires and loosen the connector slide
it<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.440> that's<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.100> can

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it out and that's just so that I can

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.800 
it out and that's just so that I can
show<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.840> other<00:03:39.960> two<00:03:40.170> wires<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:42.690> they

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
show you the other two wires here they

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.790 
show you the other two wires here they
are<00:03:42.930> they're<00:03:43.890> brown<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.340> purple<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.680> can

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
are they're brown and purple and you can

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.670 
are they're brown and purple and you can
see<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> site<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.400> numbered<00:03:48.140> 42<00:03:49.140> on<00:03:49.290> one<00:03:49.470> end

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
see the site is numbered 42 on one end

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.580 
see the site is numbered 42 on one end
and<00:03:49.950> 50<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.520> other<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:52.020> total<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.410> four

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and 50 on the other the total of four

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.980 
and 50 on the other the total of four
wires<00:03:52.770> here<00:03:52.950> inserting<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.840> let<00:03:54.959> me

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
wires here inserting here so let me

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.660 
wires here inserting here so let me
decide<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.470> back<00:03:55.620> together<00:03:55.800> as<00:03:56.340> if<00:03:56.550> we

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
decide this back together as if we

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.860 
decide this back together as if we
installed<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.390> when<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.570> put<00:04:00.750> these

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
installed it and then when you put these

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.510 
installed it and then when you put these
back<00:04:01.140> on<00:04:01.380> when<00:04:01.830> you're<00:04:01.950> done<00:04:02.070> you're<00:04:02.280> gonna<00:04:02.400> do

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
back on when you're done you're gonna do

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.010 
back on when you're done you're gonna do
it<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.820> opposite<00:04:03.180> order<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.750> how<00:04:03.959> you

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
it in the opposite order of how you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.740 
it in the opposite order of how you
would<00:04:04.320> taking<00:04:04.590> them<00:04:04.740> off<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.450> back<00:04:06.600> one

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
would taking them off so the back one

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.230 
would taking them off so the back one
needs<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> go<00:04:07.050> first<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.640> push<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.150> in

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
needs to go first and as you push it in

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.160 
needs to go first and as you push it in
and<00:04:09.330> pull<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.630> clip<00:04:09.840> up<00:04:10.020> neck<00:04:10.680> snaps<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.160> in

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:26.270 

loosen<00:04:16.170> that<00:04:16.320> push<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.980> in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.210 

in<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.460> final<00:04:27.850> step<00:04:28.060> music<00:04:28.390> right<00:04:29.110> here<00:04:29.320> is

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
in the final step music right here is

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.600 
in the final step music right here is
helping<00:04:31.030> up<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:32.170> pins<00:04:32.410> with<00:04:32.590> tape<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.070> I'm

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
helping up the pins with tape so I'm

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.860 
helping up the pins with tape so I'm
using<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:33.880> blue<00:04:34.060> masking<00:04:34.420> tape<00:04:34.600> as<00:04:34.750> we

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
using this blue masking tape as we

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.580 
using this blue masking tape as we
mentioned<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:36.450> piece<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:39.010> that<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:40.350> fold<00:04:41.350> it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
mentioned a piece like that and fold it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.460 
mentioned a piece like that and fold it
in<00:04:41.650> half<00:04:42.510> I'm<00:04:43.510> just<00:04:43.720> have<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:44.110> I'm<00:04:44.230> gently

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
in half I'm just have it be I'm gently

in half I'm just have it be I'm gently
this<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.340> primarily<00:04:45.880> just<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.270> keep<00:04:46.480> these<00:04:46.660> two

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
this is primarily just to keep these two

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.450 
this is primarily just to keep these two
from<00:04:47.020> pulling<00:04:47.290> apart<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.070> second<00:04:48.370> area

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
from pulling apart and the second area

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.150 
from pulling apart and the second area
is<00:04:48.580> also<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.940> insulated<00:04:49.540> 8<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.740> these<00:04:50.890> wires

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
is also the insulated 8 and these wires

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.680 
is also the insulated 8 and these wires
are<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:51.430> will<00:04:51.520> be<00:04:51.610> positioned<00:04:52.240> inside<00:04:52.390> of
