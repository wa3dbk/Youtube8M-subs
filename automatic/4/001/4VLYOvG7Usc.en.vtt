00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.700
 we with novice drivers move on 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.069
 slippery road 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.830
 what must be considered of course 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.920
 right and braking we are with you now 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 we will pass the traffic light we will choose a place for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 stops and tell also beginners 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.670
 drivers how the system works 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.039
 braking the modern car is not 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.969
 forget with you we squeeze 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.740
 clutch and sharply slow down but 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.390
 remember this I was motorists 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.910
 let's take the first gear perfectly 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.800
 right 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.989
 and start moving and switching and 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.440
 develop high speed 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.629
 gently let the clutch and move 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.670
 turn on the right turn in advance 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.899
 what we saw other participants 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.410
 road traffic 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.719
 they are leaving now and now that's what 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.820
 do not reset the funds was for the nose 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:08.869
 car squeeze the clutch and sharply 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:12.049
 to brake and you heard something clicks 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.299
 were yes it works valve system 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.649
 abs 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 lets the wheels so they don't 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.450
 blocked and there was no nose poke 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.210
 mobile we have dealt with this topic 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.789
 there is uneven braking 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.780
 it means one side helps the other 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:33.319
 the side of the wheels is right and left and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.210
 uniform sentence that's all so 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.670
 we start the movement but the only thing necessary 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.300
 try to remember while driving 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.679
 slow down this mode of creating a 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.009
 own right foot so stepwise 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.500
 my taps stop with you consider 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.290
 turn first gear left 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.170
 turn signal 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 and we will pass this adjacent territory and 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.360
 before the car start to brake 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.280
 how did you and I learn to start 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 braking then squeezing the clutch 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 so gain momentum switch to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.960
 second gear to gain momentum now 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.910
 we release gas we start gradually 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 slow down then have time to squeeze 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.220
 the clutch is not choking the engine 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.610
 stop completely remove from 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.930
 transfer and release the clutch 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.220
 learn them this technique by heart already 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 when summer comes from the crossroads to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 crossroads you have the right because 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.430
 not slippery 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.020
 suddenly suddenly squeeze the clutch and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.440
 brake gently 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.910
 This second principle works but better 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.800
 work on the ground even in the summer teach 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.709
 yourself than it was to automatism 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.120
 so all the professionals work with you 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.120
