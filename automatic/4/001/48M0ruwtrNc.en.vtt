00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
than these are salt and for that we

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
than these are salt and for that we
worry<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.970> day<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.360> register<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
worry and so my day and register is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
worry and so my day and register is
close<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.680> mystify<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
close to mystify some of this and take a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
close to mystify some of this and take a
look<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.420> use<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.140> our<00:01:49.170> children<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.680> using

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
look and use with our children are using

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
look and use with our children are using
and<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.780> steer

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and that way we not only can we steer

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.389 
and that way we not only can we steer
them<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:52.530> direction<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.250> they're

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
them in the right direction when they're

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.280 
them in the right direction when they're
using<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.299> determine<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
using it but we can determine when they

phone to also cut down on the cost of
testing<00:02:48.780> net<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.459> think<00:02:50.700> that's

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
testing net and and and I think that's

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.699 
testing net and and and I think that's
really<00:02:51.180> important<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.989> we're<00:02:52.230> using<00:02:52.410> or

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
really important that we're using or

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.530 
really important that we're using or
integrating<00:02:53.250> internet<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> Sun<00:02:54.299> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
integrating internet with the Sun and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
integrating internet with the Sun and
then<00:02:54.959> then<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.530> carry<00:02:55.799> over<00:02:55.980> Internet

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
then then we can carry over Internet

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.340 
then then we can carry over Internet
safety<00:02:56.610> rules<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.299> phone<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.840> use<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.019> as<00:02:58.200> a
