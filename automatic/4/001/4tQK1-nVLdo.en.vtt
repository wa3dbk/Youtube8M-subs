00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.710
 how about welcome friends we are 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.809
 watching an introduction of the piece 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.219
 between two waters of payment of light since 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.030
 he has not explained it to you surely in 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.800
 no site then we will see that 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.000
 to see this kind of life comes in 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 right to the introduction up to this 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.330
 piece 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.870
 Y 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.790
 and we are going to see them is chips 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.519
 OK 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.760
 we started 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.380
 this an awkward position it on 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 all because I have ago and arrives and we are 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.680
 to the air we do not have here already it costs 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.070
 then we put the action on the fret 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.630
 number three and we do the following a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.300
 linked by ring finger on the fret 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.330
 number 5 on the sixth string then 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.479
 we pressed the fifth string we created another 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.479
 time 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.650
 and now what we do is put the finger 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.990
 little finger on the seventh fret but without 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.320
 raise the matches here comes here 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:34.820
 a little bit of complication you see this is 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.590
 the position then we remove again finger 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.150
 little finger doing forced the seventh 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 fret of the sixth string we put the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.770
 middle finger after the sixth string and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.630
 we finish with the link already put in 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.080
 perfect t all would then be very 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.080
 slowly 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 and the fertilizer here sun but without the finger 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.210
 little finger 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.210
 and we do the following 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.110
 with an arpeggio the thumb arrives 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:15.030
 until the third rope dragging and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 now we do a finger scale here 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.310
 little finger on the second string in the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.310
 fret number six ring finger in the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.459
 probe 40 this number 50 media where 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 wait for number 4 and repeat it 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.630
 at the beginning very slowly 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.420
 Y 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.910
 which 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.400
 and now good our finger position 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.260
 medium in the third string to the fret 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.480
 number four and double the first 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.730
 turn of the number five fret and we do 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.550
 an arpeggio but the thumb only 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.970
 press to the sixth string with the sixth and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.970
 the fourth 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.800
 we press with the index finger a chopped 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.600
 without support on the first rope removing 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.600
 the ring finger beige 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.670
 that way it's worth then if you see them 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.860
 that it costs you the nut to rest like that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.220
 I'm going to hurt you, you do not have any 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.220
 sense 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.690
 two 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.250
 and now it has turned off since it was agreed that 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.250
 speaks less 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.219
 and we are going to be like this 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.769
 easier since we are has led 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:51.159
 more water in the next agreed 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:53.900
 seconds here then we put the minor 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:57.290
 but instead of canceling the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.220
 third string fret number 2 we put 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.930
 the little finger 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:09.800
 on the third string the fret number 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.800
 four and we do that awkward 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.440
 today 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.070
 we look from 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.400
 since the first flight of one was the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.400
 fifth 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.840
 well nothing else like that has to have 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.200
 to be more or less this way this 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.200
 piece 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.210
 if I do it from the beginning in this way 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.300
 we have already seen it 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.060
 i 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.980
 itself 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.570
 well this is all for this class we 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.830
 we see in the next lesson 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.830
 Greetings and see you next time
