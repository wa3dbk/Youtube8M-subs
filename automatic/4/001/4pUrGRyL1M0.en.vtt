coil p9c and humbucking sounds all

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.939 
coil p9c and humbucking sounds all
rolled<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:58.559> one

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
rolled into one

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
rolled into one
that's<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.670> PRSA<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:00.600> i<00:01:00.660> completely<00:01:01.289> agree

single volume single tone in my humble

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
single volume single tone in my humble
opinion<00:01:16.290> again<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.130> best<00:01:17.369> tremolo<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
opinion again the best tremolo in the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
opinion again the best tremolo in the
business<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:20.070> seem<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
business it really is people seem to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.030 
business it really is people seem to
think<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.790> PRS<00:01:21.240> trim<00:01:21.630> has<00:01:22.049> six<00:01:22.439> base<00:01:22.770> plate

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
think that PRS trim has six base plate

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
think that PRS trim has six base plate
screws<00:01:23.399> like<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> Fender<00:01:24.659> guitar

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
screws like a Fender guitar

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
screws like a Fender guitar
well<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.649> does<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.130> does<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.520> six<00:01:26.759> base

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
well they does it does have six base

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
well they does it does have six base
plate<00:01:27.630> screws<00:01:27.899> but<00:01:28.079> each<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> them's<00:01:28.649> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
plate screws but each one of them's a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
plate screws but each one of them's a
knife<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.219> knife<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.670> point<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> trim<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
knife a knife a point so the trim is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.270 
knife a knife a point so the trim is
just<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> best<00:01:32.310> trend<00:01:33.619> Teflon<00:01:34.619> type<00:01:34.950> nut

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
just it's the best trend Teflon type nut

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.899 
just it's the best trend Teflon type nut
on<00:01:35.790> PRS<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.689> friction<00:01:37.439> free<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.729> get

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
on PRS is so friction free you don't get
