but<00:02:05.560> with<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> few<00:02:05.920> more<00:02:06.070> tweaks<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.759> we<00:02:06.880> have

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
but with a few more tweaks so we have

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.320 
but with a few more tweaks so we have
modern<00:02:07.690> fretboard<00:02:08.080> radius<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.060> modern<00:02:10.060> frets

changed<00:02:35.650> very<00:02:35.920> shortly<00:02:36.310> afterwards<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:36.970> it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
changed very shortly afterwards so it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.370 
changed very shortly afterwards so it
was<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> fairly<00:02:37.420> short<00:02:37.660> period<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:38.260> the

some<00:04:28.290> surprising<00:04:28.830> results<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.180> do<00:04:30.330> that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
some surprising results and you do that

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.270 
some surprising results and you do that
you<00:04:30.690> think<00:04:30.900> well<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.140> maybe<00:04:31.440> should<00:04:31.740> work<00:04:31.950> or

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
you think well that maybe should work or

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.160 
you think well that maybe should work or
it<00:04:32.400> shouldn't<00:04:32.730> work<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.090> then<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.360> find<00:04:34.020> that

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
it shouldn't work and then you find that

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.960 
it shouldn't work and then you find that
it's<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.530> something<00:04:35.010> unique<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.520> powerful

the under color would come through so

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.790 
the under color would come through so
this<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.759> a<00:05:48.789> sort<00:05:49.569> of<00:05:49.659> extreme<00:05:50.139> example<00:05:50.709> of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
this is a sort of extreme example of

again I mean people I imagine by now are
probably<00:06:22.960> fairly<00:06:23.169> familiar<00:06:23.410> with<00:06:23.830> the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
probably fairly familiar with the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.610 
probably fairly familiar with the
concept<00:06:24.729> of<00:06:25.060> relics<00:06:25.449> which<00:06:25.690> is<00:06:25.840> aging<00:06:26.530> the

concept of relics which is aging the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.320 
concept of relics which is aging the
guitar<00:06:26.919> to<00:06:27.099> represent<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.940> period<00:06:28.240> from

which it comes these guitar over recent

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.520 
which it comes these guitar over recent
years<00:06:30.340> we've<00:06:31.150> done<00:06:31.449> much<00:06:31.810> more<00:06:32.110> in<00:06:32.259> the<00:06:32.349> way<00:06:32.500> of
