 Good day to all of us today 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.350
 tell in one unpleasant situation with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 faced by the owner 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.250
 minibus mercedes sprinter 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.250
 in the nine sixth body 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.230
 on just came up from germany 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 mersedes sprinter 315 sitting 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 rear left lamp was moving in place 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.190
 mounts obviously something wrong here 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.430
 to remove the lamp must be disabled 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.880
 under the asterisk 25 unscrew three screws 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 fixing the lamp body using 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.229
 long crank with a magnet 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.940
 the lantern has three more attachment points 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.120
 having understood the latch disconnect the connector 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120
 power rear light 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.930
 here they are all six mounting points of the lantern 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.130
 three holes for screws and three points 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.090
 fixing plastic retainers like 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.360
 We see from three remained this one words 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.360
 reason found 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.110
 as they say, time and money are expensive 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.790
 as a summer replacement and options 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.579
 mounts we suggest using 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.909
 the usual screw under a screwdriver with a diameter of 4 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.909
 millimeters and a length of 40 50 millimeters 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.510
 with the help of what we customize the most hat 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.510
 screw under the socket on the lantern 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.879
 we twist on the screw combined 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.760
 washer with the same screw but smaller 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.569
 diameter 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.569
 rubber part to the hat 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.959
 we twist the prepared self-tapping screw 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.959
 clamp mount socket 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.170
 disconnect the power connector of the lamp 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.450
 with the back door closed, we put a lantern 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.920
 in place by adjusting the height 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.889
 screw tightening gently fall 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.989
 in the groove attachment points 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.060
 moving the lamp all the way up 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.639
 correct you can safely spin three 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.620
 self-tapping screw as you can see such 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.729
 option to mount the rear lamp do 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 Itâ€™s not difficult to guarantee yourself 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.810
 add one more attachment point 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.889
 but even with one flashlight, great 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.889
 keeps and sits still 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.949
 subsequent removal of the lantern believe me 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.810
 it will not be difficult for you to 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.810
