00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.069
 we do not have water we have right now 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.680
 lately we have lacked give us a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.470
 day and the pipe if god is great not the 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.680
 they send and with vienna of cochinada and media 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.630
 even with frog blankets then 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.240
 now we are apart from this situation 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 of what the trucks are seeing the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.499
 possibility of doing something bigger and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 what do I call an invitation to the 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.210
 people but you really want to fight 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.800
 For the water, why not accompany us? 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 It's not fair right now I can invite it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 to see your poor house how it is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.469
 because there is no water and it is not the first 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
 time and the man who is in charge that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.519
 come I think of zacatecas what good 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.370
 that always have with us not and we 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.350
 much more than light is not needed 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
 we have water because there is a lack of leadership in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 colony or its leaders yes yes it is 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.609
 lack of leadership because as there 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.829
 interests right now politicians every 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.690
 who walks with the one who wants that saying 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
 he walks with the Lord wants 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.949
 Alejandro I do not know if he was pressured not 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.839
 we have resorted to it but if it is offered 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.700
 we have to resort and if not then for 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.920
 that's what we don Samuel 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 he left that legacy you have to fight and he 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.600
 it's more important than nothing but that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 Lord who comes from Zacatecas I never think 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.259
 we have known him and we want to know him 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.060
 I hope you hear me or that you see me for 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.270
 that at your orders and that I'm camilo 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.220
 202 towers that come and I invite you to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.460
 see my bathroom to see my kitchen and see 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.630
 the needs of first to drink water 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 regardless of the weight of the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.979
 frets are washed with the pipe 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.649
 although they have frog blankets but 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.500
 well we have to do something like 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.840
 bottle no no I what I said to Mr. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 transit if Don Samuel lived and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 I would have cut off the talk and do what 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.479
 you have to do in the colony and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.869
 this was not happening because those who 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.750
 have been Mr. Zedillo then in their 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.640
 waves Mr. Alexander also because 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.640
 if true he does not come close with those of his 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 sector and there the others are arranged 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.569
 then you have to see that there are also 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.479
 other situations of the clinic no no 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.459
 that also there look there are many boats of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.799
 waste that should not be there 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.509
 rats there is a lot of dirt you have to be 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.530
 to the slope because that's what a 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.720
 colony and they join them the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 who care for the watchers I do not know for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.000
 who they are but there are boats of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 waste
