00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
just when you thought that Curie could

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.419 
just when you thought that Curie could
not<00:00:09.120> make<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.870> cure<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.230> better<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:10.950> did

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
not make the cure it better it just did

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
not make the cure it better it just did
so<00:00:12.030> let's<00:00:12.240> walk<00:00:12.389> through<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.380> all

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
so let's walk through this first of all

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
so let's walk through this first of all
the<00:00:13.650> cup<00:00:13.830> size<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.219> no<00:00:14.280> different<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.059> you

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the cup size is no different so if you

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.700 
the cup size is no different so if you
have<00:00:15.299> old<00:00:15.599> cup<00:00:15.809> science<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.350> you're<00:00:16.470> looking

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
have old cup science if you're looking

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.080 
have old cup science if you're looking
to<00:00:16.800> upgrade<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.310> better<00:00:17.460> use<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.850> because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
to upgrade you better use them because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.370 
to upgrade you better use them because
unfortunately<00:00:18.840> they<00:00:18.930> don't<00:00:19.020> work<00:00:19.260> anymore

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
unfortunately they don't work anymore

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.759 
unfortunately they don't work anymore
with<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> pew<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:21.029> only<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.410> make<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
with the pew not only can you make a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
with the pew not only can you make a
stronger<00:00:23.189> cup<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> coffee<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> think

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
stronger cup of coffee which I think

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.080 
stronger cup of coffee which I think
everyone<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.260> always<00:00:25.680> looking<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
everyone is always looking for but it

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.370 
everyone is always looking for but it
doesn't<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> stronger<00:00:28.019> cup<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
doesn't have to be a stronger cup of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
doesn't have to be a stronger cup of
coffee<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> pour<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.310> ounce<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.609> can

coffee in a pour an ounce you can

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.910 
coffee in a pour an ounce you can
actually<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.599> stronger<00:00:31.380> cup<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> coffee
