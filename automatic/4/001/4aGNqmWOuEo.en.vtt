00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hi everyone hi guys and today today I'm

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.930 
hi everyone hi guys and today today I'm
going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.390> talking<00:00:06.600> about<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:08.550> paddock

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
going to be talking about the paddock

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.980 
going to be talking about the paddock
portal<00:00:09.300> vein<00:00:09.710> tributaries<00:00:11.540> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.929> to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
portal vein tributaries this is going to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.890 
portal vein tributaries this is going to
be<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.259> first<00:00:13.559> lecture<00:00:14.540> I'm<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.839> be

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
be the first lecture I'm going to be

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.870 
be the first lecture I'm going to be
going<00:00:16.080> over<00:00:16.320> before<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.250> move<00:00:17.490> into<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
going over before I move into the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000 
going over before I move into the
pathophysiology<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.930> why<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.859> over

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
pathophysiology of why we are going over

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
pathophysiology of why we are going over
this<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.609> think<00:00:21.480> every<00:00:22.080> student<00:00:22.140> should

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this I think every student should

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.849 
this I think every student should
understand<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> anatomy<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.880> least<00:00:24.359> before

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
understand the anatomy at least before

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
understand the anatomy at least before
they<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.550> progress<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.210> along<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
they can actually progress to along the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140 
they can actually progress to along the
pathophysiology<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.859> disease<00:00:29.580> processes

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pathophysiology of disease processes

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.790 
pathophysiology of disease processes
because<00:00:30.840> allows<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> propre<00:00:32.579> she<00:00:32.640> ate<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
because allows you to propre she ate the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.080 
because allows you to propre she ate the
disease<00:00:35.070> process<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> people<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> actually

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
disease process and people to actually

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.080 
disease process and people to actually
understand<00:00:37.050> why<00:00:37.410> patients<00:00:38.280> presents<00:00:38.969> with

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
understand why patients presents with

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.619 
understand why patients presents with
their<00:00:39.239> symptoms<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:40.710> begin<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.629> I'm

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
their symptoms so let's begin so I'm

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.030 
their symptoms so let's begin so I'm
going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> basically<00:00:43.110> I'll<00:00:43.530> point<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
going to basically I'll point out the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
going to basically I'll point out the
most<00:00:44.520> important<00:00:45.000> structures<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:45.840> look

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
most important structures let's look

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.869 
most important structures let's look
like<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> busy<00:00:46.530> slide<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.360> overall<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.870> think

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
like a busy slide but overall I think

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.130 
like a busy slide but overall I think
just<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.930> very

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
just you just have to know actually very

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
just you just have to know actually very
few<00:00:52.320> things<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> ones<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> through

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
few things and and the ones I go through

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
few things and and the ones I go through
you<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> hang<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> end<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you get the hang of it by the end of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
you get the hang of it by the end of
this<00:00:55.920> lecture<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> want

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this lecture so the first thing I want

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
this lecture so the first thing I want
you<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> notice<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> liver<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you to notice is the liver and you can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.319 
you to notice is the liver and you can
see<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> liver<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> right<00:01:02.820> lobe<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
see the liver has like the right lobe in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.250 
see the liver has like the right lobe in
the<00:01:03.359> left<00:01:03.750> lobe<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> green<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the left lobe right here the green is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
the left lobe right here the green is
the<00:01:07.320> gallbladder<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:10.340> want<00:01:11.340> us<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the gallbladder and I want us to kind of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
the gallbladder and I want us to kind of
go<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.810> tributaries<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> leads<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
go over the tributaries that leads to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
go over the tributaries that leads to
the<00:01:14.880> liver<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.490> starting<00:01:18.030> from<00:01:18.259> right<00:01:19.259> around

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the liver but starting from right around

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.789 
the liver but starting from right around
the<00:01:19.860> stomach<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> usually<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> eat<00:01:22.439> food

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the stomach so usually when you eat food

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.690 
the stomach so usually when you eat food
food<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> your<00:01:24.390> soffit<00:01:24.869> goose-down<00:01:25.700> all

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
food is go to your soffit goose-down all

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
food is go to your soffit goose-down all
the<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.240> stomach<00:01:27.780> goes<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the way to your stomach goes into your

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
the way to your stomach goes into your
duodenum<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.180> way<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.659> your

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
duodenum all the way down into your

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.370 
duodenum all the way down into your
jejunum<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.360> terminal<00:01:33.360> ileum<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:33.900> you'll

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
jejunum and terminal ileum which you'll

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.999 
jejunum and terminal ileum which you'll
be<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:36.229> where<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.560> digestion

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
be right there where all your digestion

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.569 
be right there where all your digestion
is<00:01:38.310> mostly<00:01:38.670> happening<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.829> all<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.310> into

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is mostly happening and all the way into

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.929 
is mostly happening and all the way into
the<00:01:42.079> ascending<00:01:43.079> colon<00:01:43.470> transverse<00:01:43.500> colon<00:01:44.340> all

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the ascending colon transverse colon all

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.399 
the ascending colon transverse colon all
the<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> descending<00:01:47.759> colon<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
the way down to a descending colon and

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
the way down to a descending colon and
down<00:01:49.409> into<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.799> rectum<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.310> anus<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.299> that's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
down into your rectum and anus so that's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.090 
down into your rectum and anus so that's
kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:52.049> food<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.530> only<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.890> pass

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
kind of like how food not only like pass

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
kind of like how food not only like pass
through<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.460> body<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.420> most<00:01:54.570> important

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
mesenteric vein also I want you to
notice<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.859> if<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.069> trace<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.819> as<00:02:45.030> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
notice that if you trace that as it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.649 
notice that if you trace that as it's
going<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.139> way<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.680> forms<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.700> confluence

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
going all the way it forms a confluence

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.979 
going all the way it forms a confluence
with<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.790> being<00:02:50.790> also<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.239> draining<00:02:51.629> from

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
with this being also it draining from

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.140 
with this being also it draining from
your<00:02:52.230> spleen<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.980> that's<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.400> splenic<00:02:54.000> vein

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
your spleen so that's your splenic vein

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.930 
your spleen so that's your splenic vein
and<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.470> want<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.799> take<00:02:56.190> note<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.459> that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and I just want you to take note of that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.210 
and I just want you to take note of that
that's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.239> splenic<00:02:57.750> vein<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.470> inferior

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that's a splenic vein and inferior

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.199 
that's a splenic vein and inferior
mesenteric<00:02:59.430> vein<00:03:00.200> joins<00:03:01.200> together<00:03:02.209> actually

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
mesenteric vein joins together actually

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.780 
mesenteric vein joins together actually
to<00:03:03.359> form<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:04.530> splenic<00:03:05.010> vein<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.609> see

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
to form the splenic vein and you can see

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.530 
to form the splenic vein and you can see
right<00:03:05.970> there<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.790> that's<00:03:08.909> an<00:03:09.090> important<00:03:09.510> thing

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
right there so that's an important thing

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.979 
right there so that's an important thing
to<00:03:09.659> know<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:11.069> will<00:03:11.849> also<00:03:12.150> join<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:12.810> this

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
to know this will also join with this

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.920 
to know this will also join with this
big<00:03:13.379> vein<00:03:13.909> which<00:03:14.909> is<00:03:15.120> basically<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.599> tributary

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
big vein which is basically a tributary

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.129 
big vein which is basically a tributary
of<00:03:16.230> different<00:03:16.680> anastomosis<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.930> most

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
of different anastomosis but the most

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.210 
of different anastomosis but the most
important<00:03:19.560> thing<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.949> know<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
important thing you have to know is the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.640 
important thing you have to know is the
superior<00:03:20.699> mesenteric<00:03:20.849> vein<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.650> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
superior mesenteric vein and the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.619 
superior mesenteric vein and the
superior<00:03:23.099> mesenteric<00:03:23.220> vein<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
superior mesenteric vein and the

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.300 
superior mesenteric vein and the
inferior<00:03:25.079> mesenteric<00:03:25.319> vein<00:03:25.949> which<00:03:26.160> is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
inferior mesenteric vein which is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.659 
inferior mesenteric vein which is
actually<00:03:27.379> joining<00:03:28.379> with<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.859> splenic<00:03:29.519> vein

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
actually joining with the splenic vein

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.309 
actually joining with the splenic vein
as<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.449> drains<00:03:30.750> actually<00:03:31.139> into

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
as you can see it drains actually into

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.710 
as you can see it drains actually into
the<00:03:31.409> splenic<00:03:31.739> vein<00:03:32.060> both<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.269> them<00:03:33.419> form

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the splenic vein both of them form

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.750 
the splenic vein both of them form
together<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.109> form<00:03:34.379> this<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> patek<00:03:35.159> auto<00:03:35.489> vein

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
together to form this a patek auto vein

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.930 
together to form this a patek auto vein
that's<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.419> most<00:03:36.569> important<00:03:37.049> vein<00:03:37.169> I<00:03:37.940> think

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
that's the most important vein I think

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.490 
that's the most important vein I think
every<00:03:39.150> student<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.720> need<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.139> know<00:03:40.319> that

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
every student I need to know that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.259 
every student I need to know that
because<00:03:40.680> when<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.220> talk<00:03:41.579> about<00:03:41.609> portal

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
because when we talk about portal

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.300 
because when we talk about portal
hypertension<00:03:42.739> this<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.889> what<00:03:44.099> we<00:03:44.220> are

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
hypertension this is what we are

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.800 
hypertension this is what we are
referring<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.849> right<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.540> I'm<00:03:45.629> not

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
referring to right here but I'm not

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.509 
referring to right here but I'm not
going<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.019> go<00:03:46.139> into<00:03:46.290> great<00:03:46.319> detail<00:03:46.590> we're

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
going to go into great detail we're

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.059 
going to go into great detail we're
going<00:03:47.639> to<00:03:47.699> talk<00:03:47.879> about<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.389> next<00:03:48.540> lecture

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
going to talk about in the next lecture

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.439 
going to talk about in the next lecture
so<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> paddock<00:03:50.819> portal<00:03:51.150> vein<00:03:51.299> the

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
so this is the paddock portal vein the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.300 
so this is the paddock portal vein the
paddock<00:03:51.780> portal<00:03:52.109> vein<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.859> not<00:03:53.069> going<00:03:53.250> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
paddock portal vein it's not going to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.250 
paddock portal vein it's not going to
drain<00:03:53.669> into<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> liver<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.569> as<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.079> can<00:03:55.199> see

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
drain into the liver and as you can see

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.699 
drain into the liver and as you can see
it<00:03:55.949> splits<00:03:56.459> up

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
it splits up

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.800 
it splits up
now<00:03:58.709> another<00:03:59.699> important<00:04:00.209> thing<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.510> want<00:04:00.540> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
now another important thing I want you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
now another important thing I want you
to<00:04:00.840> understand<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.190> see<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
to understand is that you can see the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.240 
to understand is that you can see the
middle<00:04:05.729> rectal<00:04:06.239> vein<00:04:06.449> and<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.889> inferior

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
middle rectal vein and the inferior

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.270 
middle rectal vein and the inferior
rectal<00:04:08.760> veins<00:04:08.940> right<00:04:09.750> here<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.319> they<00:04:10.979> stay

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
rectal veins right here and they stay

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.649 
rectal veins right here and they stay
they<00:04:11.609> have<00:04:11.699> clinical<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:14.209> significance<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.510> I

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
they have clinical a significance and I

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.870 
they have clinical a significance and I
will<00:04:16.079> talk<00:04:16.320> about<00:04:16.380> them<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.010> make<00:04:17.549> sure<00:04:17.579> you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
will talk about them but make sure you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520 
will talk about them but make sure you
understand<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.659> as<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.349> this

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
understand that as you can see this

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.640 
understand that as you can see this
inferior<00:04:19.949> ecto<00:04:20.250> veins<00:04:20.609> they<00:04:21.389> also<00:04:21.840> drain<00:04:22.349> all

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
inferior ecto veins they also drain all

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.209 
inferior ecto veins they also drain all
the<00:04:22.950> way<00:04:23.240> into<00:04:24.240> your<00:04:24.270> arm<00:04:25.219> inferior

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
the way into your arm inferior

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.210 
the way into your arm inferior
mesenteric<00:04:26.400> vein

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
mesenteric vein

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.040 
mesenteric vein
eventually<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:28.210> when<00:04:28.390> you<00:04:28.540> get<00:04:28.690> poorer

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
eventually so when you get poorer

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.660 
eventually so when you get poorer
potential<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> probably<00:04:30.040> be<00:04:30.130> able<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.370> see

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
potential you probably be able to see

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.060 
potential you probably be able to see
kind<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.450> hemorrhoids<00:04:31.930> forming<00:04:32.530> down<00:04:32.740> here

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
kind of hemorrhoids forming down here

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.120 
kind of hemorrhoids forming down here
and<00:04:33.280> I'll<00:04:33.850> go<00:04:34.090> over<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:35.040> also<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.930> minute

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
and I'll go over that also in a minute

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.860 
and I'll go over that also in a minute
another<00:04:39.640> key<00:04:39.850> important<00:04:40.360> thing<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.690> need<00:04:40.840> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
another key important thing you need to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.290 
another key important thing you need to
understand<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.710> as<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.550> can<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:43.180> is

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
understand is as you can see this is

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.810 
understand is as you can see this is
your<00:04:43.450> stomach<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:45.700> is<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:47.530> has<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.820> fundus

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
your stomach this is the it has a fundus

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.890 
your stomach this is the it has a fundus
and<00:04:49.740> has<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:51.070> greater<00:04:51.430> curvature<00:04:51.810> kind<00:04:52.810> of

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and has the greater curvature kind of

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.140 
and has the greater curvature kind of
the<00:04:52.990> lesser<00:04:53.230> curvature<00:04:53.590> right<00:04:54.010> here<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.460> kind

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
the lesser curvature right here I kind

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.340 
the lesser curvature right here I kind
of<00:04:55.180> want<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.390> drag<00:04:55.600> your<00:04:55.720> attention<00:04:56.170> right

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
of want to drag your attention right

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.070 
of want to drag your attention right
here<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.710> see<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.330> esophageal

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
here to see that is this esophageal

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.650 
here to see that is this esophageal
veins<00:04:59.500> they<00:05:00.370> actually<00:05:00.820> wrapping<00:05:01.150> around<00:05:01.390> your

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
veins they actually wrapping around your

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.920 
veins they actually wrapping around your
cell<00:05:02.020> focus<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.680> they<00:05:03.670> also<00:05:03.970> drain<00:05:04.540> into<00:05:04.780> your

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
cell focus and they also drain into your

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.650 
cell focus and they also drain into your
left<00:05:05.110> gastric<00:05:05.410> vein<00:05:06.000> which<00:05:07.000> basically<00:05:07.510> from

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
left gastric vein which basically from

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.720 
left gastric vein which basically from
this<00:05:07.870> kind<00:05:08.020> of<00:05:08.170> wire<00:05:08.410> loop<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.950> drains<00:05:09.550> also

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
this kind of wire loop and drains also

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.620 
this kind of wire loop and drains also
into<00:05:10.000> your<00:05:10.150> part<00:05:10.390> of<00:05:10.480> it<00:05:11.190> also<00:05:12.190> another<00:05:12.700> branch

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
into your part of it also another branch

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.830 
into your part of it also another branch
that's<00:05:14.620> coming<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.160> drain<00:05:15.670> into<00:05:16.360> your<00:05:16.510> part<00:05:16.750> of

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
that's coming to drain into your part of

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.610 
that's coming to drain into your part of
the<00:05:16.990> system<00:05:17.380> at<00:05:17.650> this<00:05:18.220> power<00:05:18.700> umbilical<00:05:19.330> vein

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
the system at this power umbilical vein

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.220 
the system at this power umbilical vein
and<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.919> can<00:05:21.130> see<00:05:21.490> how<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.570> were<00:05:22.630> both<00:05:22.900> drain

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
and you can see how they were both drain

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.290 
and you can see how they were both drain
into<00:05:23.560> your<00:05:23.710> part<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.790> eventually

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
into your part of it and eventually

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.270 
into your part of it and eventually
stuff<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:26.020> goes<00:05:26.169> into<00:05:26.320> your<00:05:26.470> portal<00:05:26.830> system

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
stuff that goes into your portal system

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.550 
stuff that goes into your portal system
goes<00:05:27.910> eventually<00:05:28.630> drains<00:05:28.900> into<00:05:29.080> your<00:05:29.230> central

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
goes eventually drains into your central

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.970 
goes eventually drains into your central
vein<00:05:29.800> which<00:05:30.490> eventually<00:05:31.260> exit<00:05:32.260> out<00:05:32.410> through

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
vein which eventually exit out through

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.320 
vein which eventually exit out through
the<00:05:33.100> liver<00:05:33.310> through<00:05:33.520> their<00:05:33.700> pedigree<00:05:34.150> which

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
the liver through their pedigree which

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.640 
the liver through their pedigree which
is<00:05:34.450> actually<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:34.930> shown<00:05:35.140> on<00:05:35.260> this<00:05:35.440> picture

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
is actually not shown on this picture

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.159 
is actually not shown on this picture
and<00:05:35.830> that<00:05:35.919> will<00:05:36.040> be<00:05:36.130> drained<00:05:36.400> into<00:05:36.520> your

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
and that will be drained into your

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.760 
and that will be drained into your
inferior<00:05:38.169> vena<00:05:38.350> cava<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.360> general<00:05:40.770> that's

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
inferior vena cava so in general that's

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.570 
inferior vena cava so in general that's
the<00:05:42.180> anatomic<00:05:44.070> relationships<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.190> think<00:05:45.220> you

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
the anatomic relationships I think you

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.090 
the anatomic relationships I think you
should<00:05:45.790> understand<00:05:46.560> because<00:05:47.560> when<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:47.800> talk

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
should understand because when I talk

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.140 
should understand because when I talk
about<00:05:48.250> polite<00:05:48.729> attention<00:05:48.940> in<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:50.350> next<00:05:50.500> video

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
about polite attention in the next video

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.430 
about polite attention in the next video
and<00:05:52.150> I'm<00:05:52.330> just<00:05:52.510> going<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.720> touch<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:52.960> little<00:05:53.200> bit

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
and I'm just going to touch a little bit

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.590 
and I'm just going to touch a little bit
about<00:05:53.680> it<00:05:53.890> right<00:05:54.070> now<00:05:54.100> but<00:05:54.640> you'll<00:05:55.270> be<00:05:55.390> able<00:05:55.450> to

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
about it right now but you'll be able to

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.659 
about it right now but you'll be able to
see<00:05:55.810> me<00:05:55.960> in<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.110> next<00:05:56.320> lecture<00:05:57.160> and<00:05:57.250> we'll<00:05:57.490> go

see me in the next lecture and we'll go

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.460 
see me in the next lecture and we'll go
into<00:05:57.820> details<00:05:58.330> of<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:59.020> clinical

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
into details of the clinical

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.990 
into details of the clinical
applications<00:06:00.130> you<00:06:00.280> need<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.550> watch<00:06:00.760> out<00:06:00.970> for

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
applications you need to watch out for

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.120 
applications you need to watch out for
the<00:06:01.360> signs<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:01.900> symptoms<00:06:02.260> present<00:06:02.440> patients

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
the signs and symptoms present patients

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.330 
the signs and symptoms present patients
are<00:06:03.190> going<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.400> present<00:06:03.820> with<00:06:04.030> and<00:06:04.260> also<00:06:05.340> the

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
are going to present with and also the

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.780 
are going to present with and also the
treatment<00:06:06.820> options<00:06:07.020> but<00:06:08.020> overall<00:06:08.760> when<00:06:09.760> you

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
treatment options but overall when you

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.360 
treatment options but overall when you
get<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.090> portal<00:06:10.540> hypertension<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:11.710> get<00:06:12.340> a

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
get a portal hypertension you get a

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.130 
get a portal hypertension you get a
backup<00:06:12.900> right<00:06:13.900> so<00:06:14.350> imagine<00:06:14.620> if<00:06:14.979> I<00:06:15.130> block<00:06:16.140> flow

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
backup right so imagine if I block flow

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.880 
backup right so imagine if I block flow
into<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.700> liver<00:06:18.840> blood<00:06:19.840> start<00:06:20.290> to<00:06:20.380> back<00:06:20.650> up

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
into the liver blood start to back up

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.560 
into the liver blood start to back up
into<00:06:21.160> here<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:21.820> you<00:06:21.910> see<00:06:22.090> this<00:06:22.240> power

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
into here and you see this power

patient's belly escape Medusa also if

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.920 
patient's belly escape Medusa also if
they<00:06:29.470> back<00:06:29.740> up<00:06:29.919> all<00:06:30.100> the<00:06:30.310> way<00:06:30.430> into<00:06:30.550> your

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
they back up all the way into your

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.140 
they back up all the way into your
gastric<00:06:31.930> veins<00:06:32.200> and<00:06:32.530> when<00:06:32.979> she<00:06:33.190> backs<00:06:33.729> up<00:06:33.910> all

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
gastric veins and when she backs up all

gastric veins and when she backs up all
the<00:06:34.330> way<00:06:34.450> into<00:06:35.050> suffrage<00:06:35.530> events<00:06:36.010> if<00:06:36.490> you<00:06:36.580> do

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
the way into suffrage events if you do

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.490 
the way into suffrage events if you do
an<00:06:36.820> endoscopy<00:06:37.120> you'll<00:06:37.780> be<00:06:37.870> able<00:06:38.080> to<00:06:38.200> see<00:06:38.349> the

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
an endoscopy you'll be able to see the

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.690 
an endoscopy you'll be able to see the
patient<00:06:38.860> has<00:06:39.039> esophageal<00:06:39.640> varices

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
patient has esophageal varices

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.990 
patient has esophageal varices
because<00:06:41.000> these<00:06:41.320> torturous<00:06:42.350> dilated<00:06:43.190> veins<00:06:43.520> in

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
because these torturous dilated veins in

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.360 
because these torturous dilated veins in
the<00:06:44.630> patient

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
the patient

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.800 
the patient
another<00:06:46.370> important<00:06:46.790> thing<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.180> see<00:06:47.540> is

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
another important thing you see is

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.470 
another important thing you see is
splenomegaly<00:06:48.770> right<00:06:49.550> the<00:06:49.850> spleen<00:06:50.210> is<00:06:50.240> not

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
splenomegaly right the spleen is not

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.060 
splenomegaly right the spleen is not
able<00:06:50.660> to<00:06:50.780> basically<00:06:51.080> drain<00:06:51.620> all<00:06:51.770> its

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
able to basically drain all its

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.370 
able to basically drain all its
byproducts<00:06:53.060> which<00:06:53.660> are<00:06:53.810> breakdown<00:06:54.200> of<00:06:54.230> red

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
byproducts which are breakdown of red

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.150 
byproducts which are breakdown of red
blood<00:06:54.740> cells<00:06:55.130> or<00:06:56.440> bilirubin<00:06:57.440> and<00:06:57.620> that<00:06:57.740> kind

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
blood cells or bilirubin and that kind

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.210 
blood cells or bilirubin and that kind
of<00:06:58.220> stuff<00:06:58.490> uh<00:06:58.930> it<00:06:59.930> backs<00:07:00.230> up<00:07:00.440> and<00:07:00.620> spin<00:07:00.950> becomes

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
of stuff uh it backs up and spin becomes

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.000 
of stuff uh it backs up and spin becomes
really<00:07:01.430> enlarged<00:07:02.380> also<00:07:03.380> you'll<00:07:03.620> be<00:07:03.740> able<00:07:03.830> to

really enlarged also you'll be able to
notice<00:07:04.460> that<00:07:04.670> the<00:07:04.850> patient<00:07:05.180> probably<00:07:05.540> would

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
notice that the patient probably would

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.120 
notice that the patient probably would
be<00:07:05.900> complaining<00:07:06.350> of<00:07:06.380> hemorrhoids

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
be complaining of hemorrhoids

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.070 
be complaining of hemorrhoids
you<00:07:07.520> should<00:07:07.700> be<00:07:07.790> dissin<00:07:08.150> enlarged<00:07:08.480> tortured

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
that's basically because the inferior

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.090 
that's basically because the inferior
rectal<00:07:20.540> veins<00:07:20.660> are<00:07:20.930> distended<00:07:21.260> and<00:07:21.830> it's<00:07:21.950> kind

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
rectal veins are distended and it's kind

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.370 
rectal veins are distended and it's kind
of<00:07:22.130> like<00:07:22.250> pushing<00:07:22.730> into<00:07:23.000> the<00:07:23.410> you<00:07:24.410> know<00:07:24.560> canal

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
of like pushing into the you know canal

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.570 
of like pushing into the you know canal
so<00:07:27.380> those<00:07:27.620> are<00:07:27.800> the<00:07:28.100> basic<00:07:28.550> clinical

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
so those are the basic clinical

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.440 
so those are the basic clinical
relationships<00:07:31.580> I<00:07:31.640> want<00:07:31.820> you<00:07:31.910> to<00:07:32.030> know<00:07:32.210> for

relationships I want you to know for

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.050 
relationships I want you to know for
this<00:07:32.570> for<00:07:32.960> now<00:07:33.400> we're<00:07:34.400> going<00:07:34.640> to<00:07:34.820> further

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
this for now we're going to further

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.420 
this for now we're going to further
details<00:07:35.630> actually<00:07:36.410> the<00:07:36.830> signs<00:07:37.130> and<00:07:37.340> the

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
details actually the signs and the

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.000 
details actually the signs and the
symptoms<00:07:37.580> this<00:07:38.270> is<00:07:38.450> just<00:07:38.660> a<00:07:38.750> data<00:07:39.010> anatomy

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
symptoms this is just a data anatomy

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.160 
symptoms this is just a data anatomy
just<00:07:40.220> way<00:07:40.670> to<00:07:40.730> be<00:07:40.880> able<00:07:40.940> to<00:07:41.090> kind<00:07:41.300> of<00:07:41.360> see<00:07:41.660> how

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.170 
just way to be able to kind of see how

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.610 
just way to be able to kind of see how
things<00:07:42.620> are<00:07:43.180> related<00:07:44.180> and<00:07:44.600> I<00:07:45.080> think<00:07:45.350> if<00:07:45.500> you

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
things are related and I think if you

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.590 
things are related and I think if you
just<00:07:45.830> know<00:07:46.100> this<00:07:46.340> everything<00:07:47.330> else<00:07:47.420> would

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.600 
just know this everything else would

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.330 
just know this everything else would
make<00:07:47.750> a<00:07:47.780> lot<00:07:48.020> more<00:07:48.260> sense<00:07:48.320> when<00:07:48.860> I<00:07:48.890> go<00:07:49.160> into

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.340 
make a lot more sense when I go into

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.270 
make a lot more sense when I go into
details<00:07:49.850> about<00:07:50.320> what<00:07:51.320> you<00:07:51.470> actually<00:07:51.530> see<00:07:52.130> on

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 
the patient how they present with and

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.250
