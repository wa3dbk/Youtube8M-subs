this training typically focuses on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.350 
this training typically focuses on
timing<00:00:26.689> of<00:00:26.779> all<00:00:27.310> time<00:00:28.310> in<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.489> ball<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.970> the

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
timing of all time in the ball is the

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.269 
timing of all time in the ball is the
main<00:00:29.570> factor<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:30.079> will<00:00:30.289> determine<00:00:30.349> how<00:00:30.980> well

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
main factor that will determine how well

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.470 
main factor that will determine how well
your<00:00:31.610> shot<00:00:31.849> will<00:00:31.939> be<00:00:31.970> played<00:00:32.300> and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
your shot will be played and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.329 
your shot will be played and
understanding<00:00:33.440> how<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.589> take<00:00:33.830> action<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.190> the

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
understanding how to take action to the

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:41.560 
understanding how to take action to the
ball<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:34.760> paramount<00:00:39.820> now<00:00:40.820> let's<00:00:41.180> look<00:00:41.300> at<00:00:41.449> the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
ball is paramount now let's look at the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.930 
ball is paramount now let's look at the
dynamic<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.140> timing<00:00:42.829> when<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.699> ball<00:00:43.910> is

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
dynamic of timing when the ball is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.149 
dynamic of timing when the ball is
traveling<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.720> you<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.650> when<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.949> should<00:00:46.129> be

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
traveling to you is when you should be

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.100 
traveling to you is when you should be
taking<00:00:46.400> your<00:00:46.699> backswing<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:50.660> when<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.899> ball

the end of your backswing at this point
the<00:01:00.500> middle<00:01:00.859> of<00:01:01.010> your<00:01:01.430> stroke<00:01:01.789> should<00:01:02.780> make

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the middle of your stroke should make

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.300 
the middle of your stroke should make
contact<00:01:03.590> with<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.610> top<00:01:04.910> of<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.420> bounce<00:01:06.310> when

you focus on this your shots will be

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.749 
you focus on this your shots will be
much<00:01:09.110> more<00:01:09.289> fine-tuned<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.340> you'll<00:01:10.490> find

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
much more fine-tuned and you'll find

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.440 
much more fine-tuned and you'll find
you're<00:01:10.970> making<00:01:11.330> less<00:01:12.050> unforced<00:01:12.649> errors<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
you're making less unforced errors the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
concept for the power pocket is how you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.760 
concept for the power pocket is how you
line<00:01:20.330> up<00:01:20.360> your<00:01:20.780> shot<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.319> this<00:01:21.590> will

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
line up your shot and this will

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.770 
line up your shot and this will
determine<00:01:21.890> how<00:01:22.399> much<00:01:22.550> power<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.300> can<00:01:23.539> put

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
determine how much power you can put

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.990 
determine how much power you can put
into<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.470> ball<00:01:24.649> so<00:01:25.220> when<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.429> ball<00:01:25.580> hits<00:01:25.910> the
