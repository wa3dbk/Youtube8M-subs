I'm bringing it to you all right let's
get<00:00:50.590> started<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.550> first<00:00:51.790> step<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.239> make<00:00:52.360> a

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
get started the first step is to make a

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.869 
get started the first step is to make a
big<00:00:52.690> sheet<00:00:53.050> out<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.290> gift<00:00:53.710> box<00:00:53.949> cardboard<00:00:54.400> I

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
big sheet out of gift box cardboard I

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.000 
big sheet out of gift box cardboard I
had<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.510> tape<00:00:55.690> two<00:00:55.720> sheets<00:00:56.320> together<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:56.890> make

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
had to tape two sheets together to make

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.740 
had to tape two sheets together to make
it<00:00:57.129> big<00:00:57.280> enough<00:00:57.400> this<00:00:58.089> is<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.480> make<00:00:58.629> the

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
it big enough this is to make the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.450 
it big enough this is to make the
template<00:00:59.170> out<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.290> since<00:00:59.979> I<00:01:00.100> already<00:01:00.309> had<00:01:00.430> a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
template out of since I already had a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.240 
template out of since I already had a
pickaxe<00:01:00.820> made<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.390> use<00:01:01.659> that<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.290> trace<00:01:02.589> but

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
pickaxe made I use that to trace but

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.160 
pickaxe made I use that to trace but
what<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.519> basically<00:01:03.729> do<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.150> map<00:01:04.449> out<00:01:04.659> all<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
what you basically do is map out all the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.620 
what you basically do is map out all the
pixels<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.799> pickaxe<00:01:06.220> each<00:01:06.760> pixel<00:01:07.360> being

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
pixels of the pickaxe each pixel being

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.740 
pixels of the pickaxe each pixel being
one<00:01:07.930> inch<00:01:08.110> by<00:01:08.409> one<00:01:08.440> inch<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:09.549> very<00:01:09.880> easy<00:01:10.180> when

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
one inch by one inch it's very easy when

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.180 
one inch by one inch it's very easy when
you<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.990> basic<00:01:11.350> outline<00:01:11.619> cut<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:11.979> out

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
you have the basic outline cut it out

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.270 
you have the basic outline cut it out
with<00:01:12.430> an<00:01:12.580> exacto<00:01:13.090> knife<00:01:13.240> or<00:01:13.479> scissors<00:01:14.280> next

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
with an exacto knife or scissors next

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.190 
with an exacto knife or scissors next
take<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.549> piece<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.970> insulation<00:01:16.299> foam<00:01:16.869> board

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
take a piece of insulation foam board

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.710 
take a piece of insulation foam board
and<00:01:17.380> trace<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.040> template<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.610> top<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.510> cut

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
and trace the template on top and cut

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.320 
and trace the template on top and cut
out<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.140> foam<00:01:20.350> pickaxe<00:01:20.799> use<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.820> exact<00:01:22.119> don't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
out the foam pickaxe use the exact don't

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.399 
out the foam pickaxe use the exact don't
I<00:01:22.390> have<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.540> clean<00:01:22.720> up<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.930> cuts<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.290> make

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
I have to clean up the cuts and make

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.440 
I have to clean up the cuts and make
them<00:01:23.590> smooth<00:01:23.950> next<00:01:24.549> it's<00:01:24.790> time<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.060> paint

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
them smooth next it's time for paint

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.300 
them smooth next it's time for paint
first<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.140> put<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> base<00:01:26.710> layer<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.100> white

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
first I put on a base layer of white

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.160 
first I put on a base layer of white
then<00:01:27.820> moved<00:01:28.060> on<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.420> other<00:01:28.540> colors<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
then moved on to the other colors I

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.140 
then moved on to the other colors I
looked<00:01:29.860> at<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.010> picture<00:01:30.280> for<00:01:30.580> reference<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
looked at a picture for reference of the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.969 
looked at a picture for reference of the
colors<00:01:31.509> since<00:01:31.810> they<00:01:31.990> were<00:01:32.049> kind<00:01:32.439> of<00:01:32.560> tricky<00:01:32.890> to

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
colors since they were kind of tricky to

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.789 
colors since they were kind of tricky to
mix<00:01:33.250> but<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:33.880> got<00:01:34.030> as<00:01:34.179> close<00:01:34.270> as<00:01:34.719> I<00:01:34.840> could<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:35.289> made

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
mix but I got as close as I could I made

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.410 
mix but I got as close as I could I made
mine<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> diamond<00:01:36.490> pickaxe<00:01:36.789> but<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.149> can<00:01:37.299> make

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
mine a diamond pickaxe but you can make

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.319 
mine a diamond pickaxe but you can make
your<00:01:37.570> stone<00:01:37.960> iron<00:01:38.649> or<00:01:38.979> even<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.369> gold<00:01:39.609> pickaxe<00:01:40.060> I
