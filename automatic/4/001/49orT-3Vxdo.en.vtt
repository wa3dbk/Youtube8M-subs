the<00:03:01.639> kitchen<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:03.590> was<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.769> substantial<00:03:04.069> cost

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the kitchen there was a substantial cost

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.170 
the kitchen there was a substantial cost
with<00:03:05.799> just<00:03:06.799> kind<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.040> retrofitting<00:03:07.700> some<00:03:08.060> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
with just kind of retrofitting some of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.050 
with just kind of retrofitting some of
these<00:03:08.269> planters<00:03:09.219> so<00:03:10.219> although<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.700> kegs<00:03:10.939> were

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
these planters so although the kegs were

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.699 
these planters so although the kegs were
free<00:03:11.419> because<00:03:11.719> they<00:03:11.900> were<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.079> Dustin<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
free because they were at Dustin to the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.860 
free because they were at Dustin to the
scrapyard<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.549> still<00:03:13.909> had<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.239> retrofit

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
scrapyard but you still had to retrofit

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.899 
scrapyard but you still had to retrofit
them<00:03:15.379> by<00:03:15.530> cutting<00:03:15.859> off<00:03:15.949> the<00:03:16.159> tops<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.609> getting

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
them by cutting off the tops and getting

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.770 
them by cutting off the tops and getting
the<00:03:17.000> soil<00:03:17.269> here<00:03:17.389> and<00:03:17.689> stuff<00:03:17.900> like<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.079> a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the soil here and stuff like that a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.189 
the soil here and stuff like that a
garden<00:03:20.780> has<00:03:21.109> a<00:03:21.139> high<00:03:21.829> upfront<00:03:22.719> capital<00:03:23.719> cost

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
garden has a high upfront capital cost

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.409 
garden has a high upfront capital cost
but<00:03:24.859> then<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.189> continually<00:03:25.730> spits<00:03:26.239> out<00:03:26.359> a

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
but then it continually spits out a

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.390 
but then it continually spits out a
dividend<00:03:26.930> once<00:03:27.409> you<00:03:27.560> get<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.829> infrastructure

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
dividend once you get the infrastructure

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.830 
dividend once you get the infrastructure
in<00:03:28.639> place<00:03:29.169> it's<00:03:30.169> just<00:03:30.409> constantly<00:03:31.069> giving

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
in place it's just constantly giving

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.689 
in place it's just constantly giving
proliferating<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.199> like<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:33.919> pick<00:03:34.189> a<00:03:34.219> tomato
