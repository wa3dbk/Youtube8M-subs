00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
look at is what I call taking advantage

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.380 
look at is what I call taking advantage
of<00:01:01.430> an<00:01:02.170> unintended<00:01:03.820> opportunity<00:01:04.820> meaning

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
of an unintended opportunity meaning

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.690 
of an unintended opportunity meaning
that<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.780> hit<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.050> shot<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.040> maybe<00:01:07.399> it's<00:01:07.550> not

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
that you hit a shot and maybe it's not

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.940 
that you hit a shot and maybe it's not
exactly<00:01:08.509> what<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.960> were<00:01:09.080> intending<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.680> hit

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
exactly what you were intending to hit

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.330 
exactly what you were intending to hit
or<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.240> hit<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> shot<00:01:11.810> where<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:12.500> anticipated

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
or you hit a shot where you anticipated

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.380 
or you hit a shot where you anticipated
that<00:01:13.430> your<00:01:13.640> opponent<00:01:13.940> was<00:01:14.299> going<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.890> sort<00:01:15.890> of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
that your opponent was going to sort of

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.490 
that your opponent was going to sort of
anticipate<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.539> shot<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.960> you're<00:01:18.170> hitting

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
anticipate the shot that you're hitting

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.320 
anticipate the shot that you're hitting
but<00:01:18.649> maybe<00:01:18.860> they<00:01:19.100> did<00:01:19.340> not<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:19.789> they<00:01:20.240> were

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
but maybe they did not and they were

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.820 
but maybe they did not and they were
looking<00:01:20.660> for<00:01:20.810> something<00:01:20.990> else<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.530> all<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.800> a

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
looking for something else and all of a

sudden<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.940> created<00:01:23.660> an<00:01:23.840> unintended

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
sudden you created an unintended

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.960 
sudden you created an unintended
opportunity<00:01:25.429> and<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.679> this<00:01:28.460> point<00:01:28.729> is

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
opportunity and in this this point is

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.419 
opportunity and in this this point is
just<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.479> know<00:01:29.600> one<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:30.860> many<00:01:31.100> different

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
just you know one of so many different

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
kinds of unintended opportunities that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.590 
kinds of unintended opportunities that
we<00:01:34.310> create<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.140> as<00:01:36.140> Larry<00:01:36.470> places<00:01:37.009> point<00:01:37.600> he's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
we create and as Larry places point he's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.830 
we create and as Larry places point he's
right<00:01:38.960> now<00:01:39.200> setting<00:01:39.740> up<00:01:39.890> here<00:01:40.280> hi<00:01:41.090> bouncing

Wesley Jackson and you know either he

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.290 
Wesley Jackson and you know either he
wears<00:01:48.649> kind<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.069> figured<00:01:49.340> out<00:01:49.429> exactly<00:01:49.700> where

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
wears kind of figured out exactly where

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.910 
wears kind of figured out exactly where
he<00:01:50.390> wants<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.750> play<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.110> next<00:01:51.349> shot<00:01:51.619> right

he wants to play this next shot right

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.880 
he wants to play this next shot right
now<00:01:52.160> or<00:01:52.429> he's<00:01:53.270> kind<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.440> know<00:01:54.470> kind<00:01:54.770> of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
now or he's kind of you know kind of

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.499 
now or he's kind of you know kind of
going<00:01:55.039> through<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.369> prop<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:56.000> thought

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
going through that prop that thought

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.100 
going through that prop that thought
process<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:57.459> shot<00:01:58.459> selection<00:01:59.090> but<00:01:59.270> my<00:01:59.599> bet<00:01:59.899> is

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
process of shot selection but my bet is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.350 
process of shot selection but my bet is
that<00:02:00.200> he's<00:02:00.950> already<00:02:01.399> decided<00:02:02.060> where<00:02:02.209> he's

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
that he's already decided where he's

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.210 
that he's already decided where he's
going<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.599> hit<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.800> he<00:02:03.890> hasn't

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
going to hit it but what he hasn't

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.690 
going to hit it but what he hasn't
figured<00:02:04.729> on<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:06.080> unintended<00:02:06.800> opportunity

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
figured on is the unintended opportunity

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.510 
figured on is the unintended opportunity
that<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:09.080> shot<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.500> he's<00:02:09.860> about<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.340> hit

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
that this shot that he's about to hit

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.510 
that this shot that he's about to hit
creates<00:02:10.940> he's<00:02:11.660> obviously<00:02:12.020> hitting<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.680> topspin

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
creates he's obviously hitting a topspin

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.390 
creates he's obviously hitting a topspin
forehand<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:15.230> wouldn't<00:02:15.590> call<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.069> anything

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
forehand and I wouldn't call it anything

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.479 
forehand and I wouldn't call it anything
more<00:02:16.760> than<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.030> kind<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.599> heavy<00:02:17.840> loop<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
more than just kind of a heavy loop and

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.089 
more than just kind of a heavy loop and
what<00:02:19.489> he<00:02:19.610> sees<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:21.140> know<00:02:21.260> his

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
what he sees is that you know his

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.330 
what he sees is that you know his
history<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.780> probably<00:02:24.110> okay<00:02:24.470> I'm<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:25.069> over

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
history is probably okay I'm going over

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.430 
history is probably okay I'm going over
here<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.819> corner<00:02:26.060> I'm<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> go<00:02:27.140> deep

here to this corner I'm going to go deep

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.130 
here to this corner I'm going to go deep
just<00:02:27.890> stay<00:02:28.069> neutral<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> point<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.269> what

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
just stay neutral on the point and what

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.770 
just stay neutral on the point and what
ends<00:02:30.440> up<00:02:30.530> happening<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:31.340> he<00:02:32.060> ends<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.510> playing
