00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.840
 Yes 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 Ah yes 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 1 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.190
 in 2013 reconnecting between the championship of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.890
 France rally cross with a new 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 what does twingo quote say yes that's it 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 first year where with the following to the idea 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.370
 Jean-Jacques Bénézet and the form 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.470
 and we have to integrate this this 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.140
 formula with a car that is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.790
 directly from the rally that is our 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.020
 twingo r1 which is a standard vehicle 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.320
 secure as who still answer 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
 rule the group fia r and we have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.649
 adapted slightly adapted for the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.560
 next rally cross and what is the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.780
 goal to renault to be of a new talent 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 the goal is to allow first to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.790
 more power to roll at 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 reduced cost since we have a car that 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.770
 is that is very affordable with a kit 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520
 which can be easily mounted even on 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.649
 a second hand car 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.840
 so what can be interesting for 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.869
 a youngster who wants to start in sport 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.880
 automobile and this is our our first 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.450
 goal is actually to be able to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.580
 provide a reliable product fear 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.729
 efficient and accessible to a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.830
 majority of young people and hope that we have 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.729
 nice shopping so absolutely nothing on 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.569
 this beautiful race but here I think 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.990
 only with 35 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.360
 finally not more than 30 participants in the first 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.790
 promised rallycross I think the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.740
 race is going to be beautiful and already promising 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.130
 the rally 3 in 2013 with a new 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.050
 championship the twingo cup and you were the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 first in the acid in the selection 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.120
 so you're costing you staring for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.410
 those who have been to the selection who 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540
 participate in the championship yes of course 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.030
 after there is a lot of people who will 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.700
 to come so I can come too fast 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 will already attacked all that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.690
 with the first test sessions that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.010
 will start early but there for good 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.330
 get in the car and then take the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.430
 fold because with my lack 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.730
 automotive experience never rolled 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.980
 in sports to the ends by car really 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.819
 history of karting so good we go 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 try to get there fast enough 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.480
 she was going straight into the heart of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.239
 subject what for to try to be 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.410
 direct climb on the first podium and 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.980
 how do you get at the entrance to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.739
 the selection 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 in fact with a cv cover letter 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.720
 which was so it was a selection that 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.330
 each month1 graciously offered for 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.470
 discover young talents and suddenly 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.940
 I started as like everyone else 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.650
 they received a dose are pretty much 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.220
 200 applications were ten 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.599
 selected 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.090
 so we built a very small folder 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.620
 what then are we met here 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.349
 one for the ten pilots to compete 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.790
 and then that was decisive on a 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.760
 interview with all people 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.370
 of organization and then of course 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.840
 the times that we were judged on 20 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.940
 many a lot of points all over the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.959
 day what our behavior good 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.580
 after that it's true that the key was 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.049
 really the exact times I 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.450
 finish 2nd noka selection someone 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.099
 which was organized by the fort and well 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.120
 sure the partners help is so 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.099
 now I could argue the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.400
 championship twingo r1 twingo cup so 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.730
 with eight races all in championship at 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.799
 ugly 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.010
 finally aboard the team élan team 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.000
 so sports moors that will take in 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.129
 so load all the preparation 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.069
 car maintenance but that's it and 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.090
 what is the goal this year so already 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.040
 at first it's to take 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.760
 its brands 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.890
 I want to have an evolution 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.510
 constant it would be the ideal well 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.950
 sure not tell you I'm like all 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.540
 the pilots I think we come here all 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.799
 immediately in order to win but I 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.060
 think we should not hurry as soon as 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.799
 start what fags of who are 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.359
 more used to the car that makes more 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.310
 to roll and at first it's 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.260
 So here is to evolve from co2 the car 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.200
 and then we hope as and when 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.720
 races to climb to climb the squares 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.280
 and then why not try finally 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.190
 one year end of the championship where 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.780
 possible to do podiums and before 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.639
 this year is what your 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.370
 experiences in auto sport then 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.539
 I shot for four years but 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.450
 So a few races a year since 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.530
 these students and gregated as free summer 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.050
 I did some horse racing 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.270
 cross so it's a discipline that knows 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.960
 who is who is made fair in France 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.840
 here and 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.100
 then it was interesting from the point of view 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.419
 piloting because it's a school of 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.590
 piloting we can recognize pilots 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.819
 that came from Shawcross as jean 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.289
 luc mulcher who made a very beautiful 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.690
 season a very nice entry to the charts 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.190
 in rallycross and but also from the point of 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.289
 preparing the car is also 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.680
 understand how one works 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.680
 competition vehicle
