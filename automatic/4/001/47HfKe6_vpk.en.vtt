00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.050
 of this channel this time we have the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.760
 boxing of a voice marwat but this time 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.920
 it's already a brand a little more 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.720
 recognized at least the Chinese market is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.239
 called sitel we have already had some 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 device of this brand in this channel 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.109
 so if you want to buy the link 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.429
 is in the description at this time 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.849
 where I'm doing the video costs 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.439
 57 dollars and let's see what it has 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.859
 enough interesting things has a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.079
 mediatek processor uses bluetooth 4.0 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:40.620
 compatible with android and ios resistant 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.449
 to the water and let's see if we uncover it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 let's observe its design that is not 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.710
 very nice in this case is the model 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.039
 golden let's see if I can get it out of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.249
 here in what way and ready I could already 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.410
 finally get this out is if the genuine one gets 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.620
 suppose it says in the description that it has 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 the same rhythm reader system 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 cardiac as you saw it went on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.909
 the applewhite so let's take it off 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 this mica in this way we take it off and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 as you saw right now this was lit 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.200
 it is supposed to be the heart rate reader 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's remove your plastic and ready your 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.759
 charge base its pins for the base of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 load because it is water resistant as well 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.290
 that as you can see the design is quite 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 pretty has a design that looks 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 original or you do not see that it is a copy or 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 clone of some other watches looks like 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.140
 that has its own identity so 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.940
 let's turn it on to see what if 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.550
 it's not already on 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.130
 there it is ok and tel we see its animation of 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.310
 start 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.020
 his sound 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.180
 and ready we started now says 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 connecting and has a screen brightness 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.520
 quite high that in fact the camera does not 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
 he manages to compensate very well as you see the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 brightness is quite high and also 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.270
 in the system let's say it has its own 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.700
 identity is seen to be well manufactured 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 I think at least in everyone's system 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 those that I have proven to come from china 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 This is the one I like the most 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.390
 let's see if I can lower the brightness 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.030
 so you can appreciate the best 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.000
 way here has your screen settings 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 here is the brightness let's lower it to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.459
 that you can appreciate it better how you see 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.310
 then its interface is very much 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.860
 better designed let's say and you also see 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.049
 that is fluid as you see there is nothing of the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.790
 acc or nothing we have here simply 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.610
 to return to the initial screen 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.470
 we have to make this gesture and well I'll 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.239
 to test it well to see how it works 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.489
 connects with your cell phone to do 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.200
 calls has a pedometer to count your 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.920
 steps as I told you, it works with 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.750
 android and ios is connected to do 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.670
 calls and you can also visualize the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.070
 Your device's camera from the clock 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.090
 but that only on android that function 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.530
 It is available in May 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.030
 but at least it looks like with more 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.950
 identity that the others we have 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.769
 tried and we're also going to try how 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 works the heart rate reader that 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.760
 I tell you it looks interesting that says 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.769
 which is the same one used in the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.920
 apolo uach so we 'll see if 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.360
 it responds as well as it should, so 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.459
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.110
 video you know the link to buy it 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.290
 is in the description and we see the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.290
 next
