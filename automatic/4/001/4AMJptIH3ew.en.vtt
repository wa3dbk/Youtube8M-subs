00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.249 

so<00:00:02.070> our<00:00:02.340> game<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.730> tennis<00:00:03.120> keeps<00:00:03.510> changing<00:00:03.840> and

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so our game of tennis keeps changing and

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.680 
so our game of tennis keeps changing and
to<00:00:04.589> my<00:00:04.740> mind<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.879> players<00:00:06.210> who<00:00:06.420> change

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
to my mind it's the players who change

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.870 
to my mind it's the players who change
the<00:00:06.870> game<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.890> takes<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.280> coaches<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> few

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the game and it takes the coaches a few

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.790 
the game and it takes the coaches a few
years<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.210> catch<00:00:09.389> up<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.809> then<00:00:10.469> start

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
years to catch up and then start

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.990 
years to catch up and then start
teaching<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> next<00:00:11.820> wave<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
teaching that to the next wave of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.419 
teaching that to the next wave of
players<00:00:12.559> but<00:00:13.559> here's<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> thought<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.160> how

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
players but here's the thought about how

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.480 
players but here's the thought about how
it<00:00:14.580> used<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.269> how<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.340> old

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
it used to be and how it is in the old

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.450 
it used to be and how it is in the old
days<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:18.060> said<00:00:18.590> rack<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.160> fence

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
days they said rack it to the back fence

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.779 
days they said rack it to the back fence
to<00:00:21.000> prepare<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.890> front<00:00:23.130> fence<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.609> hit

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to prepare and the front fence to hit

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210 
to prepare and the front fence to hit
and<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.660> many<00:00:24.840> still<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> idea<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and I think many still have this idea of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
and I think many still have this idea of
getting<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> racquet<00:00:27.300> back<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.810> early<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
getting the racquet back very early and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.749 
getting the racquet back very early and
very<00:00:28.680> low<00:00:29.420> racket<00:00:30.420> back<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:31.349> fence<00:00:31.759> front

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
very low racket back back fence front

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
very low racket back back fence front
fence<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.079> at<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> modern

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
fence but as you look at the modern

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.130 
fence but as you look at the modern
forehand<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.250> really<00:00:35.399> two<00:00:36.140> specific

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
forehand there's really two specific

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
forehand there's really two specific
changes<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> third<00:00:38.670> element<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> one

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
changes but the third element is the one

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
changes but the third element is the one
I<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.719> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.370> reference<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
I really want to make reference to in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
I really want to make reference to in
the<00:00:42.420> modern<00:00:42.719> forehand<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.219> rackets<00:00:44.670> pointed

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the modern forehand the rackets pointed

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.819 
the modern forehand the rackets pointed
to<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> front<00:00:45.539> fence<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.170> prepare<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to the front fence when they prepare and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
to the front fence when they prepare and
this<00:00:47.550> isn't<00:00:47.879> me<00:00:48.000> saying<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> I've<00:00:48.570> noticed

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this isn't me saying and I've noticed

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
this isn't me saying and I've noticed
this<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> preparation<00:00:50.930> no<00:00:52.100> yes<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.969> when

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
this this is preparation no yes but when

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.709 
this this is preparation no yes but when
they<00:00:54.360> hit<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:55.550> now<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> racket<00:00:57.149> points<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
they hit it now the racket points to the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.529 
they hit it now the racket points to the
back<00:00:57.870> fence<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> first<00:00:59.609> change<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
back fence so really the first change is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
back fence so really the first change is
that<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:02.039> method<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that in this method if you want this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
that in this method if you want this
reference<00:01:03.899> point<00:01:04.019> we're<00:01:05.010> pointing<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
reference point we're pointing at the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
reference point we're pointing at the
front<00:01:05.790> fence<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:07.530> finish<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> back

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
front fence and we finish at the back

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
front fence and we finish at the back
fence<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> here's<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
fence but here's where I think the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.230 
fence but here's where I think the
rubber<00:01:11.040> meets<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> road<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.880> here's<00:01:12.030> what

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
rubber meets the road and here's what

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
rubber meets the road and here's what
I'd<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> comfort

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'd like you to really get a comfort

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
I'd like you to really get a comfort
level<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> practice<00:01:15.530> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
level with and then to practice the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
level with and then to practice the
modern<00:01:16.890> pros<00:01:17.159> lag<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> racket<00:01:18.270> more<00:01:18.479> than<00:01:18.720> any

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
modern pros lag the racket more than any

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.980 
modern pros lag the racket more than any
other<00:01:19.490> era<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.729> tennis<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> means

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
other era in tennis and what that means

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
other era in tennis and what that means
is<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:23.060> Federer<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.180> Nadal<00:01:24.600> they're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
is this Federer and Nadal they're

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.460 
is this Federer and Nadal they're
waiting<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.520> start<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> swing

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
waiting like this as they start to swing

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.990 
waiting like this as they start to swing
the<00:01:28.470> racket<00:01:28.650> lags<00:01:29.509> from<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> hand<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:32.000> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the racket lags from the hand and you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.920 
the racket lags from the hand and you
see<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.509> amazing<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:34.619> far<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
see it's amazing how far they can do it

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
see it's amazing how far they can do it
before<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> pops<00:01:37.200> through<00:01:37.590> watch<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.549> again

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
before it pops through watch this again

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.219 
before it pops through watch this again
this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> lag<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:42.299> what's<00:01:42.659> happening<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this is a lag and what's happening is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
this is a lag and what's happening is
the<00:01:43.380> head<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.799> behind<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> hand<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.700> long<00:01:44.970> as

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the head is behind the hand as long as

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.870 
the head is behind the hand as long as
possible<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:47.490> two

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
possible and you get I think two

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
possible and you get I think two
elements<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> lengthens<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
elements here one is it lengthens the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
elements here one is it lengthens the
contact<00:01:50.640> zone<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.689> chance<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> hit<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
contact zone more chance to hit it and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.999 
contact zone more chance to hit it and
it<00:01:53.430> stores<00:01:53.700> energy<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> arm<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> racquet

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it stores energy in the arm and racquet

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.090 
it stores energy in the arm and racquet
that<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.520> released<00:01:57.740> violently<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that can be released violently if you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
that can be released violently if you
will<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> as<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.659> modern

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
will and as you look at this modern
