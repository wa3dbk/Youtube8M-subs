00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
seen it isn't an issue I really think is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.880

had to sell it because there is

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.380 
had to sell it because there is
certainly<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.140> potential<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:55.519> for<00:00:56.269> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
certainly a potential for it but for the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
I've had a couple of cameras that use

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.969 
I've had a couple of cameras that use
these<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.750> never<00:02:08.989> had<00:02:09.200> one<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.500> these<00:02:09.590> break

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
pretty much wiped out and it was like

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.160 
pretty much wiped out and it was like
that<00:02:46.800> after<00:02:46.950> owning<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.519> for<00:02:47.700> three<00:02:48.030> weeks<00:02:48.269> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that after owning it for three weeks so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.930 
that after owning it for three weeks so
I<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.440> know<00:02:49.530> about<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:49.980> personally<00:02:50.730> if

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
I don't know about you but personally if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000 
I don't know about you but personally if
I<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.330> looking<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> buy<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.959> camera<00:02:52.319> secondhand

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
I was looking to buy a camera secondhand

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
I was looking to buy a camera secondhand
and<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.280> saw<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> buttons<00:02:54.239> had<00:02:54.390> been<00:02:54.540> used

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
and I saw that the buttons had been used

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.350 
and I saw that the buttons had been used
so<00:02:55.140> much<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.459> lettering<00:02:57.090> had

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
so much that the lettering had

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
so much that the lettering had
completely<00:02:57.930> worn<00:02:58.230> off<00:02:58.410> I'd<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.069> had

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
completely worn off I'd think it had

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.340 
completely worn off I'd think it had
really<00:02:59.430> had<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> hard<00:03:00.030> life<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.660> probably

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
really had a hard life and probably

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.830 
really had a hard life and probably
consider<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.400> less<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.940> value<00:03:03.090> so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
consider it to have less of a value so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.479 
consider it to have less of a value so
I'll<00:03:03.930> definitely<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.650> taking<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.190> back<00:03:05.459> to

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
I'll definitely be taking this back to

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
I'll definitely be taking this back to
nakhon<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.209> see<00:03:06.360> what<00:03:06.569> they<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:07.049> about<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
nakhon to see what they can do about it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.890

but in terms of image and build quality
the<00:03:18.480> two<00:03:18.840> main<00:03:19.230> reasons<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.980> got<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the two main reasons that I got this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.620 
the two main reasons that I got this
