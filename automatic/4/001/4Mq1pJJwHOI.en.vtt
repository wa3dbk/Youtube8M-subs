00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
description and i actually watched her

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.050 
description and i actually watched her
tutorial<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:49.130> i<00:02:49.430> made<00:02:50.140> virtually<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.620> same

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
tutorial and i made virtually the same

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.009 
tutorial and i made virtually the same
thing<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.630> altered<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.940> slightly

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
thing I just altered this and slightly

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.309 
thing I just altered this and slightly
so<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.320> wasn't<00:02:57.950> exactly<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.489> same<00:03:01.120> it's

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
so it wasn't exactly the same it's

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.660 
so it wasn't exactly the same it's
chipboard<00:03:03.319> cover<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:06.590> close<00:03:06.950> yet<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.459> made

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670

cultural<00:03:29.450> confusing<00:03:30.340> crunch<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.200> then<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
cultural confusing crunch and then I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.060 
cultural confusing crunch and then I
gathered<00:03:33.709> some<00:03:33.739> lace<00:03:35.530> sort<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.739> back<00:03:36.920> of
