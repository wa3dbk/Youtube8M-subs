00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
explain to us how it's going to work so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.470 
explain to us how it's going to work so
you<00:01:02.340> said<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.640> available<00:01:02.850> air<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.270> week

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you said it's available air this week

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
you said it's available air this week
it's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> free<00:01:03.870> download<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.339> do

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's a free download so what do we do

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.590 
it's a free download so what do we do
with<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.180> go

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
with it how does this go

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
with it how does this go
so<00:01:06.750> essentially<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> download<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> free<00:01:08.100> app

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
so essentially you download the free app

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
so essentially you download the free app
to<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.520> ps3<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.409> your

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to your ps3 and you have to have your

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
to your ps3 and you have to have your
ps3<00:01:10.799> set<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> wired<00:01:11.970> connection<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
ps3 set up in a wired connection and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
ps3 set up in a wired connection and
then<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.650> wireless<00:01:14.580> feature<00:01:15.060> built<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
then the wireless feature built into the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
then the wireless feature built into the
ps3<00:01:15.840> talks<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> PSP<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:18.240> what

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
ps3 talks to the PSP and that's what

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
ps3 talks to the PSP and that's what
relays<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.900> signal<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.799> essentially<00:01:20.340> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
relays the signal so essentially your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
relays the signal so essentially your
ps3<00:01:20.880> acts<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> server<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> other<00:01:22.320> ps3's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
ps3 acts as a server to the other ps3's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
ps3 acts as a server to the other ps3's
that<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.549> playing<00:01:23.790> against<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> then

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that you're playing against and then

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
that you're playing against and then
there's<00:01:25.409> rooms<00:01:26.040> set<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.549> within<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there's rooms set up within the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
there's rooms set up within the
application<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> room

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
application so you would go to a room

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.280 
application so you would go to a room
meet<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> friends<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
meet your friends and from there you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
meet your friends and from there you
would<00:01:31.439> launch<00:01:31.979> into<00:01:32.310> ad-hoc<00:01:32.610> game<00:01:32.790> play

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
would launch into ad-hoc game play

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.150 
would launch into ad-hoc game play
now<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> mentioned<00:01:34.590> people<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:34.980> to<00:01:35.040> be

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
now you mentioned people are going to be

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.920 
now you mentioned people are going to be
able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.670> into<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> application<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
able to go into the application and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
able to go into the application and
check<00:01:37.260> out<00:01:37.440> different<00:01:37.740> rooms<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> set<00:01:38.280> things

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
check out different rooms and set things

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
check out different rooms and set things
up<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:39.150> exactly<00:01:39.510> is<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.660> gonna<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
