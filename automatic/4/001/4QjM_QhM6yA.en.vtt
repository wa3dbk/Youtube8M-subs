00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.670 

last<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:51.750> least<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:52.320> adding<00:02:52.650> some

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
last but not least I'm adding some

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.890 
last but not least I'm adding some
topcoat<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:54.060> important<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.660> add

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
topcoat it's really important to add

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
topcoat it's really important to add
your<00:02:55.110> top<00:02:55.350> coat<00:02:55.590> over<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> marker<00:02:56.370> design

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
your top coat over the marker design

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.220 
your top coat over the marker design
because<00:02:57.030> it'll<00:02:57.240> wear<00:02:57.390> off<00:02:57.420> pretty<00:02:57.930> quickly

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because it'll wear off pretty quickly

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.350 
because it'll wear off pretty quickly
otherwise<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:59.730> make<00:02:59.880> sure<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> good

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
otherwise just make sure you have a good

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.570 
otherwise just make sure you have a good
amount<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.810> top<00:03:01.050> coat<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> breath<00:03:01.800> glide

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
amount of top coat on the breath glide

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.370 
amount of top coat on the breath glide
it<00:03:02.760> very<00:03:03.030> carefully<00:03:03.330> over<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.080> design

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it very carefully over the design

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.290 
it very carefully over the design
because<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> marker<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.520> smudge<00:03:05.850> really

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
because the marker can smudge really

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.820 
because the marker can smudge really
easily<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.690> we're<00:03:09.960> done<00:03:09.990> thanks

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
easily and that's it we're done thanks

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.060 
easily and that's it we're done thanks
