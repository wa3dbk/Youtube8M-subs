 while with the naked 21 and first class

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.119

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.899
 anti gaming yes my dear friends me 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.210
 just thank you for giving us this 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.790
 Subscriber brand not just scratched 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
 but with 50 subscriptions about it too 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.480
 shot out are what now first 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.100
 not much does sound like a big one 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 Relief is after we now 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.510
 felt weeks now I say two times 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.820
 or three cars before the 2000 subscribers 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.760
 always closer to it always times 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.100
 were further away and it was really a 1 1 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.320
 a tractor for my annoying this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.920
 whole rumged in the short term the 2000 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140
 but now we finally have it 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.699
 managed and year is becoming one 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.769
 Give abo special and I say 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.570
 Not much, except for one thing 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.100
 The whole thing is not just easy 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.810
 video with which I check off the whole 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 but how I like to do that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.180
 especially with these thousands 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.670
 Subscriber brands really worthy 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.860
 I must acknowledge that 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.540
 whole in the reason as an event about one 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 make longer period with several 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.170
 videos and yes it will also be a boom 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 I'm on a tour 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.110
 certain way a bit 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.700
 have something for some of you 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.170
 likely to be even more interesting 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.850
 is considered the glory alone 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.320
 you can definitely wait for that 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.150
 but in this video should first 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.620
 something completely different and that's because I 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.320
 a new rubric in my comments 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.030
 introduce satire saturday now 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.290
 Satire is the mischievous first 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.090
 humorous and also sarcastic 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.370
 dealing with a particular 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 this is basically so satire 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.720
 it's not the official definition though 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.040
 as I would basically explain satire 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.290
 and most of you will know 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.390
 which i both in my comment s as 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.740
 in some blog entries you too 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.090
 maybe already read from me 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.130
 or anything on the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.830
 I like to post on facebook as well 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.229
 satire einarbeite and basically i want 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.209
 what satire saturday really with this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.129
 satire becomes an integral part of one 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.480
 make a comment rubric that has just 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.819
 two advantages 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.400
 First of all, it's just me 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.900
 people who are basically not ready 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.629
 because you just do not read the reader 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.000
 are my blog on anti game.de 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.730
 to read through the whole in the reason than as 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.140
 Video form those recycled with it 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.849
 they read the whole thing and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.069
 also be able to participate in the discussion 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.049
 and second, I can do that by me 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.379
 just my blog entries in this 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.079
 rubric satire saturday before i can read 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.879
 my blog and with it also website 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.349
 altogether king.de a bit 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.450
 make it more popular because I'm pretty 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.099
 I'm sure there are some among you 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.480
 does not exist at all from the existence of the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.579
 website know or 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.920
 but maybe you do not know what 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.500
 this website at all possibilities 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.819
 offers and offers also for you 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.769
 except what you've been up anyway 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.720
 youtube or other social networks 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.700
 Did you say satire on saturday? 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.680
 Logically always Saturday uploaded 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.660
 Not every Saturday is not every 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.980
 week but always when needed 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.599
 but if it is uploaded 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 besides Saturday I hope that makes sense 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.319
 So it's similar to lazy 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.609
 sunday gaming has long since joined the gaming 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.530
 of theo is not every week 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.389
 sunday but if it comes then just 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.310
 sunday looked justified with the name 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.900
 is and basically satire 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.639
 Saturday just because I mean 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.930
 blog entries are just too satirical 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.169
 a specific topic 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.040
 are read in a video format and 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.599
 it is about America today and whether this 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.269
 any more a cultural world power 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.470
 represents and everything else should be 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.579
 actually during the read 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.660
 explain texts 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.280
 and of course I want to be there 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.290
 pronounce the warning again like 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.419
 said there is a lot of satire in it 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.250
 the bread sarcasm and strong 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.959
 exaggerations that is do not take 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.849
 everything about 100 percent seriously what i got one 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.370
 text packed then it takes rather than 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.660
 food for thought and discussion and with 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.810
 I simply find a lot of these words 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.430
 fun with the text and of course the link to 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.739
 The original blog entry is in the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.740
 description to read until then yours 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.440
 anti 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.480
 the amis that this people under 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.190
 general self-love ignorance 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.840
 and dulling through mass media or 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.980
 religion is suffering now 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.560
 be known 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.760
 just why just this culture still 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.650
 as one of the most important and 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.600
 most influential economic and 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.330
 political world wants to apply comes to me 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.580
 even sometimes a mystery before well 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.260
 for example, they are banned in the us 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.700
 the small parts could be through 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.010
 be swallowed and so on 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.620
 take care of thousands of deaths each year 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.170
 but arms yes that is of course in 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.740
 to have every supermarket available 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.450
 of course also in gander 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.920
 just pink executions 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.980
 you do not want that little one 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.380
 princess screwed what do they say so 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.480
 army and that one can already with 16 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.070
 yes have to ensure that 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.870
 the adolescent already as early as possible 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.480
 possible in active duty small 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.280
 Afghans and can shoot only no 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.050
 Among other things , you can count on which number 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.860
 dead we sue there every year 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.880
 but what would I say 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.080
 America wants the weapons law-year 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.150
 wear that I do not laugh 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.590
 oh yes they indeed have even fully 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.390
 automatic weapons prohibited 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.980
 Now it is said for the poor Texan 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.280
 rambus in a wide format so only pure 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.230
 and not rata anyway we have to go 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.020
 to prevent amoklÃ¤ufen rather 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.640
 focus on ego shooter because mouse 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.370
 controller and co make the goods 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.010
 killer the easy availability and 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.760
 the improper and or 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.220
 irresponsible handling of weapons 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.440
 as well as the desensitization opposite 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.740
 same already in the child age seem 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.240
 obviously not the problem 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.070
 actually it's so unfair about that 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.990
 to draw american politics here because 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.180
 the basic problem is not in the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.730
 legislative of the usa but in the 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.650
 mentality of the people themselves 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.450
 he is not allowed to be american president 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.040
 a tone on the weapons laws 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.500
 lose without the powerful 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.030
 weapons lobby or weapons mafia what 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.880
 is actually rather true 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.400
 spanking the ass to get and so 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.710
 the usa continues on the spot 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.750
 still only one culture from one 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.580
 colony arose the forcibly america 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.310
 Aborigine displaced and this trend 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.930
 continues in the present so emerged 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.640
 on a piece of land that by spanier 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.800
 discovered and sealed by the British 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.870
 a culture became the national one 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.880
 is hard to beat proudly while she is 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.070
 as your own cultural achievements 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.260
 not much more than fast food 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.210
 can and interest in other cultures 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.120
 only then shows if it again 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.680
 what to exploit gives a culture the 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.600
 in the global economy everywhere 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.340
 Join in while your own currency 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.410
 loses more and more value and that 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.870
 economic domestic system louder 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.820
 corruption threatens to implode 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.920
 culture based on the principle of 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.360
 freedom and unity builds by 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.330
 but still own people with 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.890
 alleged social support 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.600
 the massive cost of medical 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.080
 prescribed medications sitting 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880
 stay 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.950
 they have to take it with them 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.990
 as few days of illness as possible 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.970
 unpaid days of work on the 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.860
 after all, they still have to collect 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.810
 the rates for your house as well as the gasoline 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.970
 for the five family members 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.640
 pay for distributed cars 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.680
 But the climate change will be natural 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.090
 denied and environmental contracts 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.760
 mostly avoided 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.840
 would be too expensive from similar 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.670
 probably will start too 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.010
 American flags or sculptures 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.200
 of the american eagles the patriotic 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.480
 symbols in the world today
