all<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:58.000> would<00:01:58.480> advise<00:01:58.890> padding<00:01:59.890> instead<00:02:00.340> of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
all I would advise padding instead of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.030 
all I would advise padding instead of
rubbing<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:01.750> because<00:02:02.140> it'll<00:02:02.710> give<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.010> a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
rubbing just because it'll give you a

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.340 
rubbing just because it'll give you a
better<00:02:03.220> color<00:02:03.580> payoff<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.360> your<00:02:04.990> colors

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
better color payoff and your colors

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.940 
better color payoff and your colors
won't<00:02:05.619> crease<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.990> once<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.380> have<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.530> I'm
