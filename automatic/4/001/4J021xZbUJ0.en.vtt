I ordered a GU hungry - uh shengshou 4x4

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
I ordered a GU hungry - uh shengshou 4x4
before<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> some<00:00:10.110> traveling<00:00:10.500> swoops<00:00:11.540> so<00:00:12.540> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.609 
before and some traveling swoops so this
packet<00:00:13.259> package<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.269> shipped<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.420> 28th<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.320> i

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
packet package was shipped on 28th and i

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.310 
packet package was shipped on 28th and i
have<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:18.060> me<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.690> church<00:00:18.960> first

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
have it here with me on the church first

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.179 
have it here with me on the church first
so<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> shipping<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:21.060> good<00:00:21.830> um<00:00:22.830> so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so the shipping was pretty good um so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:51.780 
so the shipping was pretty good um so
let's<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.580> into<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> package

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.390 

the<00:00:52.180> packaging<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.990> pretty<00:00:53.260> good<00:00:53.440> but<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
the packaging is pretty good but the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.400 
the packaging is pretty good but the
ball<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.780> cover<00:00:56.020> seems<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.950> be<00:00:57.040> torn<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.520> bit

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
ball the cover seems to be torn a bit

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:21.480 
ball the cover seems to be torn a bit
but<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.440> to<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.220> effect<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.820> cubes<00:01:01.090> maybe

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:37.200 

so<00:01:22.150> here's<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.690> shangzhou

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.550 

and<00:01:37.630> here's<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.410> Calvin's<00:01:38.830> loop

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.010 

then<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.079> wrong<00:01:47.079> we<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:51.899> nozzle<00:01:52.899> off

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
then this is wrong we do and nozzle off

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.749 
then this is wrong we do and nozzle off
to<00:01:53.200> keep<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:54.060> loop<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.680> first<00:01:57.100> open<00:01:57.310> up<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
to keep the loop so first open up the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:06.090 
to keep the loop so first open up the
wrong<00:01:58.119> we<00:01:58.329> do

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.080 

so<00:02:07.100> here's<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.610> Cuban<00:02:09.880> Saturday<00:02:10.880> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
so here's the Cuban Saturday and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.370 
so here's the Cuban Saturday and
stickers

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.090 

so<00:02:15.380> first<00:02:15.650> sons

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.090 

this<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> place<00:02:19.819> crispy<00:02:23.920> yep

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
this is a place crispy yep

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:41.229 
this is a place crispy yep
here's<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> box<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.610> pieces<00:02:39.880> go<00:02:40.880> home<00:02:41.060> with

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
here's the box the pieces go home with

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.350 
here's the box the pieces go home with
the<00:02:41.360> torpedo<00:02:43.989> corners<00:02:44.989> are<00:02:45.260> almost<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.739> seem

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the torpedo corners are almost to seem

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.729 
the torpedo corners are almost to seem
like<00:02:47.360> OB<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:49.269> needs<00:02:50.269> just<00:02:50.630> some<00:02:51.530> minor

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
like OB one needs just some minor

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:01.150 
like OB one needs just some minor
changes<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.840> torpedoes<00:02:58.480> that's<00:02:59.480> good<00:02:59.980> now<00:03:00.980> on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
changes and torpedoes that's good now on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:12.120 
changes and torpedoes that's good now on
to<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.660> himself<00:03:02.660> 4x4

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.820 

so<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> cube<00:03:14.000> some<00:03:14.690> chalk<00:03:15.590> powder

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
so this is the cube some chalk powder

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.480 
so this is the cube some chalk powder
it's<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:16.850> powder<00:03:17.090> or<00:03:17.300> something<00:03:20.020> this<00:03:21.020> cube

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
it's all powder or something this cube

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:36.270 
it's all powder or something this cube
is<00:03:22.900> pretty<00:03:23.900> much<00:03:24.140> small<00:03:25.240> yeah<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.890> first<00:03:28.130> sense

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.520 

that's<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:37.580> Scratchy

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:55.330 

walking<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.650> bit<00:03:53.530> that's<00:03:54.530> pretty<00:03:54.800> much<00:03:54.950> fine

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
walking a bit that's pretty much fine

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.930 
walking a bit that's pretty much fine
and<00:03:56.050> here's<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.350> kelvins<00:03:58.070> loop<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> 5

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
and here's the kelvins loop this is a 5

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.990 
and here's the kelvins loop this is a 5
mm<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:06.260> see

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.330 

this<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.050> high<00:04:10.260> viscosity<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
this is the high viscosity and the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.520 
this is the high viscosity and the
nozzle<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.640> loop<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.750> that's<00:04:16.140> pretty<00:04:16.350> much

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
nozzle of to loop so that's pretty much

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.840 
nozzle of to loop so that's pretty much
it<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:16.980> thanks<00:04:17.760> for<00:04:17.850> watching<00:04:17.940> bye
