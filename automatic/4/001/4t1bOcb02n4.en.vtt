00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.040 

as<00:02:55.870> acquisition<00:02:56.500> specialist<00:02:57.130> what<00:02:57.400> we<00:02:57.490> do<00:02:57.700> is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
as acquisition specialist what we do is

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.110 
as acquisition specialist what we do is
we<00:02:59.050> take<00:02:59.410> care<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.860> position<00:03:00.460> equipment

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
we take care of the position equipment

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.080 
we take care of the position equipment
these<00:03:01.960> remains<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.010> front<00:03:03.550> end<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:04.000> the

so<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.590> basically<00:03:06.160> deploy<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.150> equipment<00:03:07.690> and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
so we basically deploy the equipment and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.410 
so we basically deploy the equipment and
they<00:03:08.920> show<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.460> right<00:03:09.550> place<00:03:09.880> make

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
they show the on the right place make

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.360 
they show the on the right place make
sure<00:03:10.570> they're<00:03:10.720> at<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.080> right<00:03:11.200> depth<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:12.130> also

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
sure they're at the right depth we also

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.030 
sure they're at the right depth we also
ensure<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.360> these<00:03:14.290> equipments<00:03:14.860> are

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
ensure that these equipments are
