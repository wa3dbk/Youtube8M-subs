00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.109
 we're back with another video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.080
 comparison between two top of the line 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.440
 market today is the sony xperia zk and the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 lg optimus g1 share is not 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.680
 similar dimensions 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 the optimus gt at 131 point 9mm 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.939
 height and zé that a little less 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.519
 131 point six that already say gura gba 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.520
 has 68 points 9mm contacts 69 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 point 3 thick it is also more 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 thin has 8 stitches 5 mm 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 thick against 9.8 cqc and is also 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 lighter 145 grams has a ge 152 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 grams have the xperia z that we even postpone is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 great until night great day of 4.7 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.020
 inch with hd resolution and cqc it 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 wins here a 5- inch screen with 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.149
 full hd resolution 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 both have anti-scratch protection is in case 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 of the game runs gorilla glass 2012 and that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 own protection of the sony beyond 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 own technology and hygiene 2 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 the screen of the two are very beautiful screens 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.570
 but I used it because the screen was bigger than this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.890
 column here below virtual buttons 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.409
 thus making it bigger 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.030
 both also run the android your last 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.890
 version take my progression 4.1.2 to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
 android the two are running 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 comparing hardware here 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.020
 it has share also the same 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 quadcore processor of 1.5 rest one 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 cpu kuwait and gpu also the same 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.790
 320 for both of memory 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.869
 internal optimus already won with 32 gigs 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.500
 although only 25 is useful and the zé that has 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.140
 only 16 here the two faces the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 realize here that the screen you having a 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.409
 more white here than the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 optimus day also due to several 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.060
 factors 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.930
 Let's do some comparisons here. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.209
 of performance 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.099
 between these two devices starting 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.650
 by the application that is most used 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.599
 for benchmark testing , which is the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.120
 the antidote 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.689
 Let's take a test here to see and see how 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.840
 is that the two leave which of the two are the 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:35.230
 better is the best here in case 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.590
 sony beat you who took the 20 thousand 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.260
 almost 25 points against 18,424 in the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.970
 optimus g difference until small 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.669
 are two very powerful appliances. 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.790
 second test I performed here with a 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:54.639
 quadrant application in this case here 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.760
 there was even a reversal here of 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.799
 results but note that in both 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.109
 cases they were much better than the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:07.599
 but the LG Optimus and it did 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.790
 seven thousand seven hundred and few points 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.510
 against seven thousand , four hundred of the few 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.609
 sony then in the quadrant the optimus already 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.709
 earned everything to repair here with both 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.790
 are appliances is very similar to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.690
 performance 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.569
 the last test of performance is what in the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.199
 Practice a heavier game game that has 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.439
 today 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:32.760
 among the heaviest wells in 36 games 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:36.459
 I run here and they both 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.709
 perfectly match without gagging in leg o 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.500
 sound of the anthem perfectly for you 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.470
 Do not listen there, so here I come. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.530
 technical patches is when the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.340
 So it's great to say that 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.889
 with lg optimus g are top appliances that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.069
 currently lose hardware and software 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:59.139
 performance only for the galaxy s 4 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.699
 then there are two best ones being 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:06.759
 sold today in the Brazilian market 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:09.159
 one more test for running two movies here 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.560
 a movie is the two rails that is the 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.930
 trailer for the movie is 3 but the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.009
 interesting is that both are in full 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.919
 hd and once again both have succeeded 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:25.029
 perfectly run the two videos with 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.520
 full hd resolution at 30 fps 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:29.150
 I tested it too 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.389
 already passing here with up to 60 fps 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.840
 directly from a ripped blu-ray and the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:43.919
 two also perfectly rotated one 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:46.530
 video is interesting that although even the 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.250
 sony is bigger 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.500
 is that range of three virtual buttons 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.419
 which is below the screen 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.979
 she leaves until exactly the same 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.690
 same size for the two then there is 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.639
 so much advantage so the camera of the optimal 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.680
 g1 an interesting feature that 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.590
 Can you take a photo just by talking? 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.009
 with pre-set commands and the 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.949
 xperia highlight of the camera is even 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.250
 because of what he can 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.319
 take multiple photos is actually 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.759
 hold the take photo button 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:25.199
 until the end of memory is in that comparative 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.780
 I found these two interesting 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.900
 apparatus which are 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.469
 Public is similar because because 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.630
 two top-of-the-line models should not 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.789
 nothing to each other then it was 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.639
 exactly the taste of each one 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.250
 the finish of the two are only 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.400
 very well done in the case of z that he is 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.469
 plastic behind a classic 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.979
 textured but on the sides and has 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:57.960
 buttons made of aluminum and very well finished 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:06:00.719
 already the sony lg optimus genius here too 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.569
 the comparative focus that the two here 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:06.330
 a dark environment with flash and here a 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.539
 Here are the photos of the two 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.110
 they are also very similar pictures so it is 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.110
 That's it, folks
