it doesn't have much recoil and this is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
it doesn't have much recoil and this is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
doesn't need a flash suppressor because

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
doesn't need a flash suppressor because
it<00:01:33.299> already<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> low<00:01:33.930> recoil<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.619> the

it already has a low recoil and the

it already has a low recoil and the
extremely<00:01:35.369> low<00:01:35.700> fire<00:01:36.000> rate<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> i'll<00:01:37.829> take<00:01:38.070> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
instead of going out and actually

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.160 
instead of going out and actually
rushing<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.849> getting<00:02:54.180> them<00:02:54.389> because<00:02:55.079> the

rushing and getting them because the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.569 
rushing and getting them because the
fire<00:02:55.349> rates<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.859> too<00:02:56.010> low<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.400> match<00:02:56.549> up

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
against someone with an ATK and it's

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.229 
against someone with an ATK and it's
over<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:59.099> why<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> figured<00:02:59.700> this<00:02:59.819> gun<00:03:00.030> for

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
over that's why I figured this gun for

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.970 
over that's why I figured this gun for
me<00:03:00.389> gets<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> maximum<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.470> seven<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.099> ten

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
me gets a maximum of seven out of ten

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.009 
me gets a maximum of seven out of ten
but<00:03:04.980> that's<00:03:05.129> just<00:03:05.250> my<00:03:05.489> opinion<00:03:05.900> hope<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
but that's just my opinion hope you

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.110 
but that's just my opinion hope you
