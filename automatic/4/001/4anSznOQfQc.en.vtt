noon<00:00:19.040> worst<00:00:19.940> conditions<00:00:20.360> you<00:00:20.450> can<00:00:20.540> imagine<00:00:20.930> we

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
noon worst conditions you can imagine we

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.720 
noon worst conditions you can imagine we
got<00:00:21.290> like<00:00:21.470> Roman<00:00:21.710> overhead<00:00:22.010> we're<00:00:22.430> shooting

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
got like Roman overhead we're shooting

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.330 
got like Roman overhead we're shooting
in<00:00:22.880> front<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.330> vehicle<00:00:25.689> close<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.900> a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
in front of a vehicle close to a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.130 
in front of a vehicle close to a
approximate<00:00:28.340> next-door<00:00:29.060> neighbor<00:00:29.329> so<00:00:29.840> we

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
approximate next-door neighbor so we

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.749 
approximate next-door neighbor so we
have<00:00:30.259> buildings<00:00:30.680> we<00:00:30.860> got<00:00:31.009> ladders<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:31.610> got<00:00:31.730> a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
have buildings we got ladders we got a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.300 
have buildings we got ladders we got a
lot<00:00:31.910> of<00:00:31.939> things<00:00:32.149> going<00:00:32.329> on<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:32.899> we<00:00:33.770> want<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.220> be

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
lot of things going on and we want to be

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.670 
lot of things going on and we want to be
able<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.550> block<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.790> light<00:00:35.090> overhead<00:00:35.680> we

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
able to block that light overhead we

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.930 
able to block that light overhead we
want<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:36.950> be<00:00:37.010> able<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.190> bring<00:00:37.430> some<00:00:37.640> light<00:00:37.820> in

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
want to be able to bring some light in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.700 
want to be able to bring some light in
as<00:00:38.090> well<00:00:38.300> we're<00:00:39.110> going<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.380> be<00:00:39.500> able<00:00:39.559> to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
as well we're going to be able to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.920 
as well we're going to be able to
compress<00:00:40.130> that<00:00:40.430> background<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.690> we've<00:00:41.809> got<00:00:41.899> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
compress that background so we've got a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.840 
compress that background so we've got a
lot<00:00:42.110> of<00:00:42.140> elements<00:00:42.470> going<00:00:42.710> against<00:00:43.190> us<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:43.730> got

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
lot of elements going against us you got

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.650 
lot of elements going against us you got
a<00:00:43.880> car<00:00:44.120> here<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.420> we<00:00:44.540> got<00:00:44.719> our<00:00:45.019> wires<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:45.679> got

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
a car here and we got our wires we got

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.360 
a car here and we got our wires we got
so<00:00:47.660> making<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.440> best<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.739> can<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:49.070> hold<00:00:49.340> it

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
so making the best we can here hold it

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:01.259 
so making the best we can here hold it
there

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.259 

we<00:01:02.269> going<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.749> change<00:01:02.929> my<00:01:03.109> angle<00:01:03.440> view<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:05.059> get

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
we going to change my angle view to get

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.940 
we going to change my angle view to get
in<00:01:05.420> instead<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.200> fence<00:01:06.439> we're<00:01:06.710> gonna<00:01:06.799> get

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
in instead of the fence we're gonna get

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.850 
in instead of the fence we're gonna get
more<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.780> vegetation<00:01:08.780> here<00:01:09.020> off<00:01:09.619> today

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
more of a vegetation here off today

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:21.940 
more of a vegetation here off today
that's<00:01:10.040> going<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.280> wine<00:01:10.399> -<00:01:11.119> I'm<00:01:11.420> pretty<00:01:11.720> good

okay<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> concludes<00:01:23.190> our<00:01:23.490> photo<00:01:23.670> session<00:01:24.260> as

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
okay that concludes our photo session as

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.840 
okay that concludes our photo session as
I<00:01:25.500> said<00:01:25.650> before<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:26.070> had<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> elements

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I said before we had a lot of elements

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.570 
I said before we had a lot of elements
going<00:01:27.120> against<00:01:27.420> us<00:01:27.510> but<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:28.680> pulled<00:01:29.190> over<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
going against us but we pulled over that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.420 
going against us but we pulled over that
screen<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.480> stop<00:01:30.750> diffuser<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.280> he

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
screen with a one stop diffuser and he

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.670 
screen with a one stop diffuser and he
gave<00:01:32.550> us<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.730> beautiful<00:01:32.940> soft<00:01:33.540> light<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.840> mean<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
gave us a beautiful soft light I mean it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200 
gave us a beautiful soft light I mean it
was<00:01:34.770> almost<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.160> window<00:01:35.460> light<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
was almost like a window light you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
was almost like a window light you
pretty<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.570> could<00:01:36.750> create<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.050> studio

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
pretty much could create a studio

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.990 
pretty much could create a studio
outdoors<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.250> mean<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> loved<00:01:38.670> work<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.940> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
outdoors I mean I loved work in the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.150 
outdoors I mean I loved work in the
studio<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:40.080> when<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.230> work<00:01:40.470> outdoors<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
studio but when I work outdoors are like

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.970 
studio but when I work outdoors are like
bringing<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.000> elements<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.560> studio<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
bringing the elements of the studio to

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.370 
bringing the elements of the studio to
locations<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.300> use<00:01:45.480> my<00:01:45.630> scrim<00:01:45.960> gym<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.230> lot

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
locations so I use my scrim gym a lot

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.580 
locations so I use my scrim gym a lot
most<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.370> on<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.880> stop<00:01:48.350> Sun<00:01:49.350> drops

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
most of time on that one stop Sun drops

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.140 
most of time on that one stop Sun drops
a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.010> maybe<00:01:50.250> take<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.060> know

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
a little bit maybe take it down you know

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.260 
a little bit maybe take it down you know
to<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.690> quarter<00:01:52.200> stop<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.500> something<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.150> if<00:01:54.150> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to a quarter stop or something and if I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.790 
to a quarter stop or something and if I
need<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> kick<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> light<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.200> bring<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.770> my

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
need a kick and light I bring in my

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.830 
need a kick and light I bring in my
reflectors<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.640> did<00:01:56.850> actually<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
reflectors which we did actually we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
reflectors which we did actually we
eventually<00:01:58.260> used<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.620> goal<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.100> warm<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
eventually used a goal to warm up the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.610 
eventually used a goal to warm up the
skin<00:02:00.030> tones<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:01.500> our<00:02:01.710> models<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:03.620> simple

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
skin tones of our models and simple

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.100 
skin tones of our models and simple
setup<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.490> shot<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.729> 500<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> second<00:02:07.410> at<00:02:08.090> f/4

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
setup we shot up 500 of a second at f/4

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.660 
setup we shot up 500 of a second at f/4
so<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.290> her<00:02:10.380> final<00:02:10.649> shot<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.190> 200

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so that was her final shot at 200

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
so that was her final shot at 200
millimeters<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.270> all<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.450> compression

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
millimeters to get all that compression

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.400 
millimeters to get all that compression
so<00:02:13.200> turned<00:02:14.100> up<00:02:14.190> pretty<00:02:14.310> good
