that's<00:04:10.940> basically<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:13.400> don't<00:04:13.549> use<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:15.039> okay

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
that's basically we don't use that okay

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.879 
that's basically we don't use that okay
fuel<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.660> on<00:04:18.970> looking<00:04:19.970> how<00:04:20.120> much<00:04:20.269> we've<00:04:20.510> got

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
fuel is on looking how much we've got

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.140 
fuel is on looking how much we've got
appears<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:22.070> be<00:04:22.190> fuel<00:04:22.520> that's<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.970> right

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
appears to be fuel that's the right

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.089 
appears to be fuel that's the right
gauge<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.900> wing<00:04:24.110> that's<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.590> left<00:04:24.830> gauge

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
gauge in the wing that's the left gauge

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.270 
gauge in the wing that's the left gauge
in<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> wing<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:26.740> we're<00:04:27.740> going<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.919> start<00:04:28.160> off

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
in the wing and we're going to start off

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.770 
in the wing and we're going to start off
with<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.550> left<00:04:28.729> because<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.270> carburetor

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
with the left because the carburetor

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.750 
with the left because the carburetor
overflow<00:04:30.440> actually<00:04:30.860> goes<00:04:31.039> back<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> left

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
overflow actually goes back to the left

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.440 
overflow actually goes back to the left
tank<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.389> if<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.410> had<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.919> left<00:04:34.130> tank<00:04:34.400> full<00:04:34.669> and

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
tank so if we had the left tank full and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.330 
tank so if we had the left tank full and
we<00:04:35.599> took<00:04:35.810> off<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> right<00:04:36.620> tank<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
we took off on the right tank and the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.310 
we took off on the right tank and the
carburetor<00:04:37.669> field<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.180> we'd<00:04:38.270> start<00:04:38.570> over

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
carburetor field that we'd start over

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.839 
carburetor field that we'd start over
flowing<00:04:39.560> fluid<00:04:40.099> out<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.729> left<00:04:41.210> tank

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
flowing fluid out of the left tank

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.520 
flowing fluid out of the left tank
pushing<00:04:43.849> the<00:04:44.000> hydraulic<00:04:44.630> accumulator

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
pushing the hydraulic accumulator

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.950 
pushing the hydraulic accumulator
release<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.970> hydraulic<00:04:47.479> pressure<00:04:47.720> will

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
release so the hydraulic pressure will

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.730 
release so the hydraulic pressure will
work<00:04:48.169> go<00:04:49.160> ahead<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.460> turn<00:04:49.700> on<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:49.940> battery

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
work go ahead and turn on the battery

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.640 
work go ahead and turn on the battery
the<00:04:51.740> generator<00:04:52.960> now<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.020> reason<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.590> turned

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
the generator now the reason I turned

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.670 
the generator now the reason I turned
these<00:04:55.160> off<00:04:55.460> is<00:04:55.820> because<00:04:56.300> if<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:56.630> would<00:04:56.810> if<00:04:57.530> I

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
these off is because if I would if I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.350 
these off is because if I would if I
would<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.010> turned<00:04:58.849> them<00:04:59.000> into<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
would have turned them into the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.810 
would have turned them into the
automatic<00:04:59.780> position<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.860> can<00:05:01.039> listen<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.460> the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
automatic position you can listen to the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.310 
automatic position you can listen to the
radiator<00:05:02.750> shut

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.020 

so<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.830> don't<00:05:07.040> mess<00:05:07.190> with<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.610> until<00:05:07.880> I've

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
so I don't mess with that until I've

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.810 
so I don't mess with that until I've
actually<00:05:08.270> got<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.720> started<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:10.280> we<00:05:10.400> got<00:05:10.580> there

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
actually got it started so we got there

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.850 
actually got it started so we got there
I<00:05:10.850> got<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.120> prime<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.110> early<00:05:12.350> Mustangs

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
I got a prime it and the early Mustangs

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.210 
I got a prime it and the early Mustangs
he<00:05:13.100> actually<00:05:13.400> had<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.840> manually<00:05:14.840> prime<00:05:18.220> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
he actually had to manually prime the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.670 
he actually had to manually prime the
engine<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:20.720> got<00:05:20.870> fuel<00:05:21.110> pressure<00:05:21.380> over

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
engine and so I got fuel pressure over

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.980 
engine and so I got fuel pressure over
here<00:05:21.860> with<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.130> fuel<00:05:22.400> pressure<00:05:23.740> pump<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:25.100> a

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
here with the fuel pressure pump on a

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.550 
here with the fuel pressure pump on a
couple<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.050> squirts<00:05:27.700> let's<00:05:28.700> lock<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.560> that's

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
couple of squirts let's lock that that's

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.330 
couple of squirts let's lock that that's
still<00:05:31.100> up<00:05:31.340> throttle<00:05:32.090> crack<00:05:32.540> and<00:05:34.000> I<00:05:36.070> have<00:05:37.070> not

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
still up throttle crack and I have not

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.250 
still up throttle crack and I have not
flown<00:05:37.670> this<00:05:37.940> in<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> while<00:05:38.390> so<00:05:38.720> I'm<00:05:39.020> going<00:05:39.230> to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
flown this in a while so I'm going to

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.510 
flown this in a while so I'm going to
have<00:05:39.500> to<00:05:39.800> pre<00:05:40.700> all<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.270> engine

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
have to pre all the engine

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:52.090 
have to pre all the engine
you<00:05:43.520> didn't<00:05:43.760> pre-oiled<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.330> engine<00:05:44.660> did

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.739 

what<00:05:52.670> that<00:05:52.850> does<00:05:53.120> is<00:05:53.540> it's<00:05:53.750> going<00:05:54.050> to

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:55.749 
what that does is it's going to

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.350 
what that does is it's going to
pressurize<00:05:56.619> the<00:05:56.919> system<00:05:57.129> so<00:05:57.789> I've<00:05:57.909> got<00:05:58.089> a<00:05:58.119> wall

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
pressurize the system so I've got a wall

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.690 
pressurize the system so I've got a wall
pressure

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
pressure

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.300 
pressure
and<00:05:59.850> it's<00:06:00.060> going<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.300> pump<00:06:00.750> oil<00:06:01.080> up<00:06:01.860> through

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
and it's going to pump oil up through

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.300 
and it's going to pump oil up through
the<00:06:02.460> crankshaft

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.040 

you<00:06:05.430> know<00:06:05.490> takes<00:06:05.880> about<00:06:06.030> two<00:06:06.420> minutes<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:06.930> get

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
you know takes about two minutes to get

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.310 
you know takes about two minutes to get
away

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.189 

I<00:06:14.350> am<00:06:14.710> actually

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:45.269 

very<00:06:20.110> important
