00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone with you andrey andreev my 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.420
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:13.769
 1000 14 task for planting forests highlighted 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:25.670
 plot of 300 hectare spruce planted 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:25.670
 by 3 tenths and pine by 4 tenths 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.360
 How many guides is Hector behind this for and spruce 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.700
 and pine together well let's see 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.460
 spruce is occupied three tenths 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.440
 and a pine four tenths how much 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 busy how to add fractions denominator 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 rewrite and in the numerator we write 3 plus 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.449
 4 1 numerator second numerator and for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.760
 which was between them plus it turns out 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:07.860
 70 let's sketch this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 plot like this suppose he 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.729
 there was such a rectangle why 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 Cumin and just such a painted it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 Now it will be very convenient to divide into 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.409
 10 parts here I divided it into 10 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.880
 equal parts three tenths 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.600
 it was that we have there spruce and let el 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.600
 will be green 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:48.350
 three tenths it was spruce 1 2 3 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.080
 well, let's go purple can and let 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:59.660
 there will be a four tenths pine four 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:02.030
 tenths one-two-three-four that I conditionally 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.570
 divided the entire plot into 10 equal 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.790
 parts 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.850
 why exactly 10 chose because you 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.450
 denominator is worth a dozen three tenths 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.570
 there are three parts and out of 10 this is spruce and four 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.240
 tenths of this pine how many 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.000
 it turned out planted only seven tenths 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.850
 one two three 4 5 six 7 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 not immediately planted 3 more left 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:33.890
 part can be solved further by this 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:37.520
 in the way see the 70s it's from what 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.930
 the numbers are from 300 hector we all 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.769
 The plot was this 300 hector correctly but 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.989
 we are 300 hector divided into 10 equal 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.500
 parts a10 so let's get 300 hector 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.700
 divide by 10 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.120
 300 divided by 10 turns 30 hectares 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.519
 it turns out that each of 10 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.580
 plots this 30 hectares that is it is 30 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.250
 it's 30 here 30 here 3010 here and so 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.459
 further 10 pieces to deny that 300 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.130
 Hector how many planted 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.640
 spruce and pine planted 7 pieces seven 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.140
 tenths 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.280
 therefore further 330 hector multiplied by 7 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.630
 the whole field is divided by 10 to count 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.440
 square 1 hour 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.290
 and then we see that seven were planted 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.350
 of them here are seven of them 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.549
 so multiply by 7 this 30p deny 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.220
 it is 30-30-30 this 30-30 there are seven of them 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:51.310
 seven multiply by thirty seven multiply 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:55.130
 at 321 and even down 0 210 hector 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.209
 only as we decided we first folded / 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.940
 and got this / 70s and then us 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.130
 Need to read seven-tenths of 300 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.770
 hector therefore 300 hector first 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.330
 divide by 10 and then divide by 10 first 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.080
 and then multiply by 7 and we get 210 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.190
 could be solved a little differently 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.200
 could count a little bit 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.730
 differently 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.600
 first we think that we put one 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:28.820
 plot this 30 hectares further recall 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.250
 that pine we don't have spruce spruce it's three 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.590
 tenths then how much did you eat 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.300
 look here 30 here 30 here 30 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:43.970
 then only ate 30 hectares multiplied 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.700
 at 3 each section means this and 30 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.880
 hectare so 30 hectares is one 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.240
 plot and we had three such 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.800
 planted with spruce so all spruce 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.479
 planted 90 hector basics planted 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 four such sites each 30 and 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:16.400
 All such plots planted 44 to 30 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:20.570
 this is 120 this is fir and this is pine how to find out 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:26.419
 how much is 90 plus 120 we get 200 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:30.110
 10 hectares but this time was 210 here 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.479
 here I specifically told you two 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.300
 different solutions can be solved so 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.000
 is it possible to write so which way you 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.789
 liked more write understandable 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.380
 you decide if you like my videos 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.470
 advise friends 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.470
 classmate on this all all bye
