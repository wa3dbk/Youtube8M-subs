00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 all right 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.500
 Y 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.990
 the drina leaves are some cakes that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.180
 you can find in many stores me 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 I prepare all the Christmases I 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.730
 They look like a very soft and exquisite sweet 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.410
 I'm going to show you how I do them so alone 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.599
 we're going to need white wine flour 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.529
 butter or lard some 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.110
 oranges and icing sugar to sprinkle 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.870
 We start by throwing in a measuring cup 50 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 milliliters of orange juice if not 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 you have measuring cup are about 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.399
 3 tablespoons and half tbsps we add 50 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.950
 milliliters or three tablespoons and a half of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.530
 White wine 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.240
 we put in a bowl 400 grams of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 butter that we will have melted 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.800
 previously in the microwave the recipe 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.840
 original takes instead of butter 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.640
 lard if you prefer to make them 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.110
 with lard simply 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.870
 use 400 grams of lard 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.000
 we add the orange juice and the wine 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.610
 white we will go through a colander to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.620
 that no pulp falls and what 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.860
 mix well with rods until 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.630
 that the butter is well undone 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.700
 we add 600 grams of flour that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.979
 we will throw through a strainer giving 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.080
 taps to sift the and so 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.920
 incorporate more air and leave more 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.320
 fluffy 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.840
 and finally we are going to incorporate the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 zest of three oranges those go 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.130
 scratching only the orange part without getting 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.590
 to the white part that you already know 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.990
 bitter is very important that you see them 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.060
 very good with our low soap or 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.789
 You can also use oranges from 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.500
 organic farming because in addition to 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.070
 this recipe is especially important 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.689
 that the oranges are very good 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.450
 we mix everything stirring with a 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.369
 spoon until it is well integrated and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.890
 finally with the help of hands 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.860
 we form a ball of dough 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.690
 we put it back in the container 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.300
 we cover with film paper and we're going to 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.920
 put in the fridge for an hour to 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.860
 that the dough hardens and we can 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.290
 work well 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.200
 We put a piece of paper on the table 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.830
 vegetable or baking paper we place 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.680
 On top of the dough and cold flat with 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 the help of a roller or a bottle 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.990
 leaving it about two centimeters 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.940
 thickness and we cut rectangles of 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.940
 approximately 4 x 6 centimeters but 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 that we already place them to your liking 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.500
 on the baking tray that we will have 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.270
 lined with greaseproof paper not necessary 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.760
 that you put them apart because in 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.890
 the oven is just going to grow and we're going 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.870
 to put back in the fridge for 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.930
 half an hour because you have to bake 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.330
 when they are very cold we put in the oven 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.970
 that we will have preheated to 200 degrees 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 with heat up and down for 15 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.270
 minutes at 15 minutes down to 175 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.350
 degrees and we'll leave them 30 minutes 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.330
 plus 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.280
 once baked we will place them 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.320
 on a grate to cool 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.930
 we do this so that they fit 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.120
 crunchy and do not get wet underneath 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.580
 and when they have cooled 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.680
 sprinkle with plenty of icing sugar 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.989
 sieving it with a colander 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.900
 abundant sugar because we realize that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.810
 the dough does not carry and we already have our 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.269
 delicious home made puff pastries are a 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.090
 sweet as you see very easy to do already 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.189
 I find it exquisite they are not very sweet 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.810
 because the dough does not carry sugar but 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.900
 they have an orange flavor and the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.909
 delicious butter I leave a photo 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.400
 of the cut so you can see how they are 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.010
 inside are like a kind of butter 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.019
 a little puffed up indeed for 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.849
 check that they are well made to the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.370
 finish the baking time you can 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.769
 take an open it and check that this one 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.019
 be its appearance if you see that inside 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.190
 had a little raw dough still 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.710
 you can leave them five more minutes 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.900
 and nothing else, I hope you dare to do 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.390
 this sweet with such an aromatic flavor and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.050
 delicate and that you like a kiss a lot 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.050
 bye 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.680
 have 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.370
 at 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.980
 and
