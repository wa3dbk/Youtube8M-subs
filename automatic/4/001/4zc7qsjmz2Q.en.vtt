00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
there it was a lot of downtime because

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.959 
there it was a lot of downtime because
you'd<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.380> strip<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:25.859> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.369> scrub<00:01:26.789> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and then let it dry and then you'd have

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
and then let it dry and then you'd have
to<00:01:29.070> wax<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:30.179> Johnson<00:01:30.600> nights<00:01:30.749> flooring

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
to wax it with Johnson nights flooring
you<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.100> scrub<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.759> there's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you just go in scrub it and there's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
you just go in scrub it and there's
little<00:01:33.810> downtime<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:36.289> like<00:01:37.289> Johnson<00:01:37.560> IDIQ

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.179 
little downtime I like Johnson IDIQ
because<00:01:38.789> that<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> low<00:01:39.810> maintenance

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
