with you what would it be and this knife
is<00:00:59.390> my<00:00:59.920> interpretation<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:01.910> is

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
is my interpretation of that so this is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.160 
is my interpretation of that so this is
kind<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.420> Roach's<00:01:02.899> survival<00:01:03.770> knife<00:01:05.170> very

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
kind of Roach's survival knife very

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.959 
kind of Roach's survival knife very
simply<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:06.859> a<00:01:06.889> knife<00:01:07.189> that's<00:01:07.520> big<00:01:07.700> enough<00:01:07.729> to

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
simply so a knife that's big enough to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.419 
simply so a knife that's big enough to
chop<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.329> tree<00:01:08.450> down<00:01:08.719> a<00:01:09.289> knife<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.009> big

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
chop a tree down a knife that is big

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.959 
chop a tree down a knife that is big
enough<00:01:10.459> to<00:01:10.819> build<00:01:10.999> a<00:01:11.149> shelter<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.319> something

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
enough to build a shelter but something

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.219 
enough to build a shelter but something
delicate<00:01:13.969> enough<00:01:14.209> that<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.600> could<00:01:14.840> process

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
delicate enough that you could process

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.620 
delicate enough that you could process
small<00:01:15.799> game<00:01:16.100> with<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:16.609> maybe<00:01:16.789> even<00:01:17.179> breast<00:01:17.420> out

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
small game with so maybe even breast out

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.429 
small game with so maybe even breast out
a<00:01:17.689> pigeon<00:01:18.139> or<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.319> small<00:01:18.619> bird<00:01:18.889> you<00:01:19.310> know<00:01:19.459> and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
a pigeon or a small bird you know and

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.739 
a pigeon or a small bird you know and
this<00:01:21.439> is<00:01:21.499> my<00:01:21.979> interpretation<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.999> that<00:01:23.389> tool

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
this is my interpretation of that tool

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.830 
this is my interpretation of that tool
so<00:01:24.170> it's<00:01:24.529> um<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.609> quite<00:01:26.060> heavy<00:01:26.389> it's<00:01:26.659> quite<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
so it's um it's quite heavy it's quite a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.499 
so it's um it's quite heavy it's quite a
substantial<00:01:27.020> knife<00:01:27.619> as<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:27.950> can<00:01:28.130> see<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:29.359> the

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
substantial knife as you can see but the

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.260 
substantial knife as you can see but the
way<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.719> use<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.950> really<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:31.579> dependent<00:01:32.149> on

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
way you use it really it's dependent on

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.050 
way you use it really it's dependent on
a<00:01:32.630> having<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.649> lanyard<00:01:33.889> and<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.639> lanyard

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
a having a lanyard and the lanyard

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.120 
a having a lanyard and the lanyard
literally<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.170> put<00:01:36.349> your<00:01:36.439> thumb<00:01:36.649> through<00:01:36.979> it

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
literally just put your thumb through it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.769 
literally just put your thumb through it
wrap<00:01:37.399> it<00:01:37.429> around<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.789> back<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:38.119> your<00:01:38.240> hand<00:01:38.539> and

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:38.779 
wrap it around the back of your hand and

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:42.249 
wrap it around the back of your hand and
take<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.709> full<00:01:40.009> grip<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.639> handle<00:01:41.090> now<00:01:42.049> that

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
take a full grip on the handle now that

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.889 
take a full grip on the handle now that
is<00:01:42.409> really<00:01:42.709> a<00:01:43.249> safety<00:01:43.789> feature<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.479> when

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
is really a safety feature for when

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.219 
is really a safety feature for when
you're<00:01:45.109> processing<00:01:46.270> thick<00:01:47.270> firewood<00:01:47.990> maybe

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
you're processing thick firewood maybe

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.749 
you're processing thick firewood maybe
if<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.499> really<00:01:48.799> were<00:01:48.919> chopping<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.369> tree<00:01:49.399> down

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
if you really were chopping a tree down

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.679 
if you really were chopping a tree down
or<00:01:49.999> something<00:01:50.209> like<00:01:50.299> that

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
or something like that

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.480 
or something like that
it<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.229> ensures<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.859> knife<00:01:52.009> can't<00:01:52.279> fly

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
it just ensures that the knife can't fly

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.569 
it just ensures that the knife can't fly
out<00:01:52.520> your<00:01:52.819> hand<00:01:53.829> but<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.950> other<00:01:55.069> great<00:01:55.340> thing

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
out your hand but the other great thing

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.419 
out your hand but the other great thing
about<00:01:55.669> lanyard<00:01:56.329> is<00:01:56.539> if<00:01:57.109> you<00:01:57.259> put<00:01:57.469> your<00:01:57.649> put

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
about lanyard is if you put your put

it's a slightly different grind on it
but<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.270> more<00:02:36.510> kind<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.870> scalpel<00:02:37.440> sharp

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100

slightly different grind again and that
is<00:02:42.060> more<00:02:42.360> suited<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.750> chopping<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.620> then

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
is more suited to chopping and then

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.960 
is more suited to chopping and then
right<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:44.970> by<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.210> hilt<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.780> blade<00:02:45.990> changes

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
right up by the hilt the blade changes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.310 
right up by the hilt the blade changes
slightly<00:02:47.970> again<00:02:48.420> where<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.110> really

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
slightly again where you can really

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990 
slightly again where you can really
choke<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.010> something<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.790> would<00:02:50.880> be

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
choke up on something and that would be

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.310 
choke up on something and that would be
the<00:02:51.120> part<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.420> blade<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.020> would<00:02:52.140> use

the part of the blade that you would use

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.950 
the part of the blade that you would use
maybe<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:53.220> fine<00:02:53.430> carving<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.630> making
