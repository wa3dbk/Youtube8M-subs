00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.990
 or the girls that give 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.110
 you will see my daughter has bought these 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.810
 shoes are cool 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 they are precious 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.460
 but they have a tone 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.050
 khedira to pink does not become beige 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.650
 it's more the color is more travel than 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.500
 there is that it has pink the fact is that it does not 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 find a necklace and he remembered the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.580
 necklaces we buy at two euros 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 I taught him but in the other clear channel 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.480
 so maybe that is the same is the same 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.730
 same I bought them to disarm it and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.050
 in the end I did not disarm it and now it comes 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.980
 of pearls because 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 well it's too long hangs a lot 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.290
 we do not like neither she nor me 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.920
 but thought of removing this piece and the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.790
 tear is putting it up here for 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.580
 make it shorter the collar not so tan 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.259
 exaggerated so let's go to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.470
 disarm it and mount it without it being so 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:25.680
 long because it's just that this is the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 shoe tone is the same 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 so 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.990
 we have to remove from the glass 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.660
 well we have already removed all this that are 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.970
 the truth is that they are too big 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.250
 Now I do not know if she would like that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.670
 take the crystal and I will 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.650
 ride alone with this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.650
 with tears only 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.670
 much finer the other way that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 It's too big too charro 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 How do you say 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.680
 too coarse 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.680
 and so it will be much finer sure 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.410
 and well, this will be used to 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.500
 other necklaces to make bracelets 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.400
 or the girl has determined I think 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.420
 yes that's the way I like it much more 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.610
 it looks thinner it is not so long and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 nothing for this if you want it to be done 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.420
 A bracelet 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.360
 today we will do another little thing out there 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.360
 It seems 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.159
 do not tell me 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.520
 good is precious of death is 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.550
 cool 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.900
 this is your color this is the color that 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.900
 better goes to shoes 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 yes 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.120
 for nothing only an idea for 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.850
 recycle necklaces that sometimes 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.400
 we have abandoned and then they can 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.800
 come well for any set 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.100
 recycling by changing it in the form or 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.110
 another little thing is worth nothing 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.110
 See you goodbye
