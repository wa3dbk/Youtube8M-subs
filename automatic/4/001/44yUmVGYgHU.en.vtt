00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.309
 Think about it. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:33.950
 cool 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:36.620
 In the lab, the comparison target is the same maker. 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 Vick is a cp 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.260
 The ProPuss 620 Quad Core is the bank's flat quad with the l3 cache removed. 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.280
 It is. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:51.830
 The most progressive point along the lake is the speed of motion 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.309
 Callisto 550 has the lowest number of noses, but the odd check is the deepest 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:59.780
 Gunpowder Shadow How Much Does the Sound Differ 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.850
 The graphics card is quite manageable for i adi 587 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.570
 Why should I compare it to the expensive 5870 once I get sleepy in how good it is 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.570
 I wanted to write 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.720
 Aoa 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 The first experiment ran 30 explorers at once 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.520
 Watch your screen comfortably. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.549
 This is also the time itneyo I saw the results applied to a distant thing 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.610
 The triple core of 2.82 lg is the fastest. 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.330
 Is it because of the very speed and 00 of l3 cache 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 Yes 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.200
 Second, Photoshop Photoshop has a higher clock speed than lake 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.980
 I liked it. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.900
 What about the latest version of CS4 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.900
 Apply 15 filters haebwatseupnida 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 The result is that the higher the number of clocks than the number of nose, the better the performance. 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:42.270
 This is a very disappointing result 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:48.650
 Third, are there any games that support game multicore corruption ? 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.650
 The 5870 is so good that I do not think there's a big performance difference. 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.750
 There is no difference in the results of the first intervention. 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.750
 So what about the second game? 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.769
 The first two frames around Missy chainde an amazing level 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.769
 I was wondering if I could use a less powerful graphics card. 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.250
 The fourth is the encoding program I like to use for video encoding. 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.250
 Correctly support multicore 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.950
 Yes 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.680
 The results show that the quad core was the fastest, even when the club was low . 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.049
 Let's do one more thing. The next iPod encoder just put it into an assortment. 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.880
 U 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.100
 U 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.100
 U 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 The results show that dual-core clock is the best 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.050
 It's fast. 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.780
 Finally, the video editing program is premier. 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.330
 I'm rendering an hdv clip. 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.330
 It took a long time and I heard it at super speed. 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.900
 U 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.889
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.849
 U 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.849
 U 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.850
 Premiere cs5 In the Otsu Haier version, the quad core is overwhelmingly dominant. 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.930
 4 2 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:13.980
 Fifth, let's compare the 3d rendering speed 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.980
 Kindly quad core, four rendering lines work at the time 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.960
 Also 3d rendering is also allowed at low clock speeds and many cpu performance 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.960
 good 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.910
 Finally, the power test 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.910
 I'm sure the code core will consume the most power. 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.270
 Unexpectedly, the quad core is the lowest due to the impact of the clock. 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.160
 So how about a grass? 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.349
 It looks like a solo instead of a good result . 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.180
 era 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:24.080
 There is one thing you should not forget about experiment. 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:27.290
 Please remember that this is limited to the 3 cpu you used. 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.310
 And the cpu accident money from 150,000 won 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.310
 Eat four. 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.350
