00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
now folks this is my simple little

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.760 
now folks this is my simple little
experiment<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:05.069> called<00:00:05.370> an<00:00:05.520> earth<00:00:05.670> battery

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
experiment it's called an earth battery

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.270 
experiment it's called an earth battery
so<00:00:07.770> simple<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.309> ridiculous<00:00:09.200> take<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.280> copper

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
so simple is ridiculous take a copper

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.360 
so simple is ridiculous take a copper
pipe<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.630> galvanized<00:00:13.380> pipe<00:00:13.679> drive<00:00:14.190> them

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
pipe and a galvanized pipe drive them

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.330 
pipe and a galvanized pipe drive them
into<00:00:14.490> ground<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> foot<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:15.630> deep<00:00:16.340> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
into ground about a foot or so deep I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.460 
into ground about a foot or so deep I
don't<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.330> very<00:00:18.539> important<00:00:19.050> how<00:00:19.170> far

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
don't think it's very important how far

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.390 
don't think it's very important how far
a<00:00:19.770> party<00:00:20.369> our<00:00:20.580> mind<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.359> 35<00:00:22.020> foot<00:00:22.410> all

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
a party our mind is like 35 foot all

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910 
a party our mind is like 35 foot all
right<00:00:23.670> run<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> small<00:00:24.330> gauge<00:00:24.660> wire<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.380> don't

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
right run a small gauge wire I don't

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.390 
right run a small gauge wire I don't
know<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> wire<00:00:26.849> or<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
know if you can see the wire or not and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.179

run<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.210> galvanized<00:00:33.840> pipe<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
run it down to your galvanized pipe the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.910 
run it down to your galvanized pipe the
pipes<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.149> should<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.630> laid<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.870> north<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
pipes this should be laid out north and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.479 
pipes this should be laid out north and
south<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.530> copper<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.790> north<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:43.489> was

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
south with the copper at the north I was

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.270 
south with the copper at the north I was
told<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> makes<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> difference<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.379> then

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
told that makes a difference and then

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
told that makes a difference and then
naturally<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.570> end<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.079> mine<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> copper

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
naturally on one end or mine the copper

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.029 
naturally on one end or mine the copper
in<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> wire<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:52.050> contacting

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
in I have a wire is actually contacting

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.790 
in I have a wire is actually contacting
the<00:00:53.940> copper<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
the copper on this then use the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
the copper on this then use the
insulated<00:00:58.800> part<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> doesn't<00:01:00.840> make

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
insulated part so it doesn't make

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.560 
insulated part so it doesn't make
contact<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> bare

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
contact and then here you have a bare

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
contact and then here you have a bare
spot<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.080> hook<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.439> multimeter<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.450> then

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
spot to hook your multimeter and then

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
spot to hook your multimeter and then
naturally<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:06.990> hook<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> ground<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
naturally you hook your ground to the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 
naturally you hook your ground to the
pipe<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
pipe so you're going through the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.429 
pipe so you're going through the
multimeter<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> pipe

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
multimeter not just not into the pipe

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.249 
multimeter not just not into the pipe
and<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.790> getting<00:01:15.210> hope<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.080> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and right now I'm getting hope you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.469 
and right now I'm getting hope you can
see<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.040> bright<00:01:17.280> Sun<00:01:17.930> I'm<00:01:18.930> getting

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
see this and this bright Sun I'm getting

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.600 
see this and this bright Sun I'm getting
1.3<00:01:21.479> volts<00:01:23.420> not<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:26.400> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
1.3 volts not a lot but it's just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
1.3 volts not a lot but it's just
interesting<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.750> easy<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.439> voltage

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
interesting it's so easy to get voltage

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
interesting it's so easy to get voltage
just<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> ground<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.579> anyway<00:01:32.869> let's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
just from the ground so anyway let's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.380 
just from the ground so anyway let's
send<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.350> next<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
send that for that and next I'm going to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.740 
send that for that and next I'm going to
my<00:01:39.390> next<00:01:39.450> project<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:41.150> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.450> grow

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
my next project I'm going to put grow

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.160 
my next project I'm going to put grow
some<00:01:42.990> pears<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.490> bottle<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.119> thought<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
some pears in a bottle I thought that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
some pears in a bottle I thought that
ought<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.560> neat<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.729> Crown<00:01:47.970> Royal

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
ought to be neat that's my Crown Royal

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.090 
ought to be neat that's my Crown Royal
bottle<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.920> pears<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
bottle I put two pears in that one and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
bottle I put two pears in that one and
here<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.549> Kentucky<00:01:54.270> gentlemen<00:01:54.720> bottle<00:01:55.110> I'm

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
putting one in that so we'll see how

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.970 
putting one in that so we'll see how
that<00:01:58.229> turns<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:59.210> thank<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.540> watching
