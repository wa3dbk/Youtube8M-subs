00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and hours and hours having a blast but

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
and hours and hours having a blast but
once<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.760> hit<00:00:35.850> through<00:00:36.059> 30<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.690> like

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
once I hit through 30 I was just like

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
once I hit through 30 I was just like
all<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.170> gotta<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> sleep<00:00:38.040> but

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
all right I gotta go to sleep but

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
all right I gotta go to sleep but
anyways<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.420> I'll<00:00:39.600> make<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> clear<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
anyways first I'll make it clear that we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
anyways first I'll make it clear that we
were<00:00:41.070> glitching<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> taking<00:00:41.910> advantage<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
were glitching and taking advantage of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
were glitching and taking advantage of
exploits<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.230> don't<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.559> consider

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
exploits now I don't really consider

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
exploits now I don't really consider
cheating<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.850> were<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> custom

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
cheating because we were in a custom

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
cheating because we were in a custom
game<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.649> believe<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
game and I don't believe you know that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
game and I don't believe you know that
gets<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> leaderboard<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.660> weren't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
gets kind of a leaderboard so we weren't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
gets kind of a leaderboard so we weren't
really<00:00:48.930> affecting<00:00:49.590> anyone<00:00:49.800> else<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.550> were

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
really affecting anyone else we were

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.970 
really affecting anyone else we were
just<00:00:50.670> having<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.149> time<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.570> ourselves

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
just having a good time all by ourselves

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.170 
just having a good time all by ourselves
nonetheless<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> said<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.820> were<00:00:53.940> doing

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
nonetheless like I said we were doing

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
nonetheless like I said we were doing
glitches<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> exploits<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.289> any<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
glitches and exploits so if any of you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.450 
glitches and exploits so if any of you
guys<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.190> hundred<00:00:56.430> percent

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
guys are just one hundred percent

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
guys are just one hundred percent
against<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.270> some<00:00:57.390> reason<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.809> suggest

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
against that for some reason I suggest

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.630 
against that for some reason I suggest
is<00:00:58.590> clicking<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> video<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> don't<00:00:59.520> wanna

couple invincible electric traps inside
this<00:01:09.540> room<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> bus<00:01:10.229> stop<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.189> room

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this room at the bus stop now this room

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
this room at the bus stop now this room
is<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.610> good<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> general<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.450> co-op

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
is pretty good in general for co-op

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.969 
is pretty good in general for co-op
transit<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.470> no<00:01:13.590> windows<00:01:13.950> or

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
transit because there's no windows or

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
transit because there's no windows or
doors<00:01:14.280> open<00:01:14.760> besides<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.750> front<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
doors open besides that one up front and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
doors open besides that one up front and
I<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.860> many<00:01:17.009> people<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I don't think many people go in here I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
I don't think many people go in here I
could<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> wrong<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.229> did<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.619> just

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
could be wrong but what we did is just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
could be wrong but what we did is just
time<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> fort<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> destruction<00:01:21.360> basically<00:01:21.780> as

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
time a fort of destruction basically as

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
time a fort of destruction basically as
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.740> barely<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you can see we barely have to do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
you can see we barely have to do
anything<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.909> kill<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> zombies<00:01:24.540> however

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
anything to kill the zombies however

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
anything to kill the zombies however

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I totally recommend it because it'll

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.380 
I totally recommend it because it'll
reduce<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.219> amount<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.520> zombies<00:01:56.880> coming<00:01:57.119> into

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
reduce the amount of zombies coming into
the<00:01:57.479> room<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.290> course<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the room and of course you just get a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
the room and of course you just get a
ridiculous<00:01:59.729> amount<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.119> points<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.750> maxed
