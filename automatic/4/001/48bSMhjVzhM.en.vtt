minute
there's<00:01:00.600> Ricardo<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.760> with

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there's Ricardo right there with

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.920 
there's Ricardo right there with
brothers<00:01:03.120> clay<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.920> FCW<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:09.180> used<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
brothers clay in FCW what used to be the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
brothers clay in FCW what used to be the
developmental<00:01:10.530> system<00:01:11.030> until<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.180> turned

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
developmental system until they turned

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
developmental system until they turned
in<00:01:12.600> XT<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.140> their<00:01:13.500> developmental<00:01:13.950> system

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
in XT into their developmental system

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.160 
in XT into their developmental system
which<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:16.369> did<00:01:17.570> they<00:01:18.570> did<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:19.110> job

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
which I think did they did a good job

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.609 
which I think did they did a good job
making<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.860> decision<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> Ricardo

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
making that decision but Ricardo

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.370 
making that decision but Ricardo
Rodriguez<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.280> actually<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.030> good

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
Rodriguez is actually a very good

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
Rodriguez is actually a very good
wrestler<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:30.229> think<00:01:32.299> that<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.939> going

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
wrestler and I think that this is going

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.740 
wrestler and I think that this is going
to<00:01:36.630> lead<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:38.630> Ricardo<00:01:39.890> actually<00:01:41.390> wrestling<00:01:42.390> or

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to lead to Ricardo actually wrestling or

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
to lead to Ricardo actually wrestling or
at<00:01:42.869> least<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.170> hope<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.579> going

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
at least I hope that's what it's going

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.700 
at least I hope that's what it's going
to<00:01:44.820> result<00:01:45.149> in

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.580 

but<00:01:49.710> he<00:01:50.670> may<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.420> may<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.630> wrestle<00:01:52.499> as<00:01:52.560> Ricardo

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
but he may or may not wrestle as Ricardo

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.609 
but he may or may not wrestle as Ricardo
does<00:01:55.590> anybody<00:01:55.829> remember<00:01:56.750> el<00:01:57.750> local<00:02:00.319> he's<00:02:01.319> been

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
know is Ricardo Rodriguez and he used to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.170 
know is Ricardo Rodriguez and he used to
be<00:02:20.640> known<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:20.930> chimera<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.610> he<00:02:23.610> was<00:02:23.819> all

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
be known as chimera and he was all

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.130 
be known as chimera and he was all
around<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> independent<00:02:25.379> circuit<00:02:27.170> now<00:02:30.530> maybe

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
around the independent circuit now maybe

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.119 
around the independent circuit now maybe
this<00:02:34.140> means<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.430> Ricardo<00:02:35.940> character<00:02:36.480> is

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
this means that the Ricardo character is

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.720 
this means that the Ricardo character is
going<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:39.090> pretty<00:02:39.599> much<00:02:39.840> die<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.730> Ricardo

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
going to pretty much die and Ricardo

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
going to pretty much die and Ricardo
won't<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.090> there<00:02:42.299> no<00:02:42.450> more<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.709> means

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
won't be there no more and that means

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.819 
won't be there no more and that means
that<00:02:44.250> he<00:02:44.760> will<00:02:44.940> wrestle<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:46.019> el<00:02:46.290> local

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
that he will wrestle more as el local

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.470 
that he will wrestle more as el local
and<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.819> Ricardo<00:02:48.239> Rodriguez<00:02:48.780> character<00:02:50.480> well

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
and the Ricardo Rodriguez character well

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.050 
and the Ricardo Rodriguez character well
being<00:02:51.690> won't<00:02:52.319> be<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:52.650> anymore<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.340> that

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
being won't be there anymore so that

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.110 
being won't be there anymore so that
means<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.599> local<00:02:55.109> can<00:02:55.920> maybe<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.459> brought<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
means a local can maybe be brought up to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.710 
means a local can maybe be brought up to
debtor<00:02:57.450> Vee<00:02:57.840> or<00:02:58.400> he<00:02:59.400> can<00:03:01.669> maybe<00:03:02.669> he<00:03:03.269> can<00:03:03.450> stay

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
debtor Vee or he can maybe he can stay

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.710 
debtor Vee or he can maybe he can stay
in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.959> next<00:03:04.260> e<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.410> while<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> think<00:03:06.209> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
in the next e a while but I think the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.569 
in the next e a while but I think the
main<00:03:06.930> reason<00:03:06.959> why<00:03:07.530> he<00:03:07.709> couldn't<00:03:07.980> wrestle<00:03:08.310> on

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
main reason why he couldn't wrestle on

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.500 
main reason why he couldn't wrestle on
TV<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.380> cuz<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.519> know<00:03:13.910> Ricardo<00:03:14.910> can't<00:03:15.180> do<00:03:15.329> two

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
TV is cuz you know Ricardo can't do two

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.900 
TV is cuz you know Ricardo can't do two
things<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.930> once<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> mean<00:03:19.250> either<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
things at once so I mean either the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.470 
things at once so I mean either the
