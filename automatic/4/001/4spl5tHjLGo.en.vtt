the inside stays protected it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
the inside stays protected it's
basically<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> giant<00:01:21.780> snap-on<00:01:22.350> case<00:01:22.530> that's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
basically a giant snap-on case that's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
basically a giant snap-on case that's
extra<00:01:23.640> strong<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.479> easy<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> take<00:01:24.930> apart

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
extra strong pretty easy to take apart

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
extra strong pretty easy to take apart
and<00:01:25.290> put<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.409> together<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.700> going

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and put back together so I'm not going
