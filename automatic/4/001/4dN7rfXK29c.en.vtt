00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:55.900
 Hydro expect that there are hearts has 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:02:02.590

 take his but want to be here 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 so 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.470
 which is good with nan we can put 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:26.440
 an inventory look like that you 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 will take fucking body maybe a little 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 break we shoot justo the spider 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.460
 sorry for this interruption 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.860
 that's why searched here then 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.959
 how do you see me him and here I am 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.650
 like that you are you see all these 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.830
 cards on one side you can put some 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.160
 stuff inside here delay it by 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.160
 example you are going for something 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.390
 convenient 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.070
 that's what's good in the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 logic 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.260
 to make a rope because you see there 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.120
 they were clinging a rope so in 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.550
 you create a kraft table worth 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.570
 position like that on a rope 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.290
 the three cities in boulay and its shape 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:36.140
 thanks to the rope 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:38.680
 look we can shoot with or do not know 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.680
 ask that 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.010
 take the rope and here you say it and 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.620
 I think it's pretty handy 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.090
 the agreement because if you have one 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.440
 you have to go somewhere I have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.290
 not want to let you just take 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.330
 the rope 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.390
 that was because I hope that 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.540
 this sum will not have any more hi all 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 the world
