00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
there we go all right now the front I

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.270 
there we go all right now the front I
guess<00:02:17.560> would<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.890> cockpit<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.189> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
guess would be the cockpit of the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.800 
guess would be the cockpit of the
aircraft<00:02:18.969> going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> go<00:02:19.239> ahead<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.390> bend<00:02:19.719> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
aircraft going to go ahead and bend it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.270 
aircraft going to go ahead and bend it
down<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:21.010> rotate<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.879> then<00:02:22.629> take<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.049> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
down then rotate it then take it and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420 
down then rotate it then take it and
slide<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:25.030> into<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.900> center<00:02:26.829> torso<00:02:27.280> of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
slide it down into the center torso of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.459 
slide it down into the center torso of
where<00:02:27.579> Starscream<00:02:28.209> space<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:28.659> be<00:02:28.689> I'm<00:02:29.349> going

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
where Starscream space will be I'm going

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.250 
where Starscream space will be I'm going
to<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.590> ahead<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.879> take<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.090> front<00:02:31.659> portion

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
to go ahead and take the front portion

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.020 
to go ahead and take the front portion
of<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.530> plane<00:02:32.769> bend<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.370> down<00:02:33.400> bend<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.000> down

with who say you know I really like more
complicated<00:03:08.079> transformers<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.739> guess<00:03:08.889> they

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
complicated transformers I guess they

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.349 
complicated transformers I guess they
really<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.549> Transformers<00:03:09.790> that'd<00:03:10.239> be

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
really like the Transformers that'd be

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.360 
really like the Transformers that'd be
like<00:03:10.540> Rubik's<00:03:10.930> cubes<00:03:11.169> or<00:03:11.290> something<00:03:11.620> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
like Rubik's cubes or something that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.429 
like Rubik's cubes or something that
makes<00:03:12.700> me<00:03:12.849> sad<00:03:13.359> because<00:03:13.629> I<00:03:13.780> can't<00:03:14.109> do<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> rubix

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
makes me sad because I can't do a rubix

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.369 
makes me sad because I can't do a rubix
cube<00:03:14.829> but<00:03:15.579> i<00:03:15.870> would<00:03:16.870> say<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.109> his

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
cube but i would say that his

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.080 
cube but i would say that his
transformation<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:18.099> very<00:03:18.310> simple<00:03:18.669> and<00:03:18.940> if

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
transformation is very simple and if

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.280 
transformation is very simple and if
you're<00:03:19.209> not<00:03:19.269> interested<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> very<00:03:20.079> simple

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
you're not interested in a very simple

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.869 
you're not interested in a very simple
transformer<00:03:20.799> just<00:03:20.829> go<00:03:21.099> ahead<00:03:21.159> and<00:03:21.250> pass<00:03:21.489> up<00:03:21.669> on

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
transformer just go ahead and pass up on

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.059 
transformer just go ahead and pass up on
that<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.389> guess<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.840> may<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.169> be<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.530> for

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
that I guess that may not be for you for

more<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.479> know<00:03:49.540> right<00:03:50.459> articulation<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.549> this

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
more you know right articulation of this

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.219 
more you know right articulation of this
figure<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.329> head<00:03:52.540> has<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> little<00:03:53.109> bit<00:03:53.199> of

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
figure the head has a little bit of

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.289 
figure the head has a little bit of
articulation<00:03:53.979> which<00:03:54.129> you<00:03:54.340> can<00:03:54.609> kind<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.090> only

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
articulation which you can kind of only

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.920 
articulation which you can kind of only
rotate<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.169> using<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.359> tip<00:03:58.359> of<00:03:58.479> the<00:03:58.569> airplane

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
rotate it using the tip of the airplane

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.020 
rotate it using the tip of the airplane
to<00:03:59.139> be<00:03:59.199> able<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.409> do<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.709> but<00:04:00.430> he<00:04:00.639> does<00:04:00.790> have

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
to be able to do that but he does have

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.599 
to be able to do that but he does have
he<00:04:01.209> can<00:04:01.389> look<00:04:01.569> side<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.019> side<00:04:02.199> yes<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.220> candle

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
he can look side to side yes you candle

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.159 
he can look side to side yes you candle
telling<00:04:03.879> me<00:04:03.939> you<00:04:04.060> can't<00:04:04.090> take<00:04:04.870> any<00:04:05.109> so<00:04:05.290> stupid

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
telling me you can't take any so stupid

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.960 
telling me you can't take any so stupid
then<00:04:08.169> if<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.379> want<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.709> use<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> arms<00:04:09.699> you

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
then if you want to use the arms you

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.369 
then if you want to use the arms you
have<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.389> little<00:04:10.629> bit<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.750> articulation

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
have a little bit of articulation

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.259 
have a little bit of articulation
depending<00:04:11.799> on<00:04:11.979> where<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.549> wing<00:04:12.729> placement<00:04:13.180> is

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
depending on where the wing placement is

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.369 
depending on where the wing placement is
and<00:04:13.509> whether<00:04:13.659> or<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.989> have<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.199> gun<00:04:14.349> on

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
and whether or not you have the gun on

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.949 
and whether or not you have the gun on
so<00:04:14.590> we'll<00:04:14.709> take<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.949> gun<00:04:15.099> off<00:04:15.479> his<00:04:16.479> hands<00:04:16.750> can

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
so we'll take the gun off his hands can

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.050 
so we'll take the gun off his hands can
reach<00:04:17.109> out<00:04:17.349> you<00:04:17.979> know<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.549> higher<00:04:18.759> than

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
reach out you know a little higher than

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.230 
reach out you know a little higher than
some<00:04:19.299> standard<00:04:19.690> figures<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.909> it<00:04:21.909> can<00:04:22.090> rotate

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
some standard figures can it can rotate

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.000 
some standard figures can it can rotate
360<00:04:23.080> as<00:04:23.169> long<00:04:23.289> as<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.529> kind<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.830> past

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
360 as long as you can kind of get past

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.500 
360 as long as you can kind of get past
the<00:04:24.159> wing<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:24.580> really<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:24.880> can't<00:04:25.090> actually<00:04:25.270> no

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
the wing but really it can't actually no

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.160 
the wing but really it can't actually no
it<00:04:25.599> can't<00:04:25.810> rotate<00:04:26.080> 360<00:04:26.620> because<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.860> wings

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
it can't rotate 360 because the wings

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.660 
it can't rotate 360 because the wings
have<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.410> be<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.710> block<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.520> can

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
have to be there to block it you can

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.770 
have to be there to block it you can

bend at the elbow knee is a little bit

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.970 
bend at the elbow knee is a little bit

that far back and then you can bend the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.010 
that far back and then you can bend the
knees<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:46.940> then<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:47.300> get<00:04:47.360> pretty<00:04:47.570> far<00:04:47.840> and

range of articulation and range even
though<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.970> has<00:04:56.480> nothing<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.810> do<00:04:56.870> with<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
though really has nothing to do with the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.660 
though really has nothing to do with the
transformation<00:04:57.500> whatsoever<00:04:57.800> then<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.460> toes

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
transformation whatsoever then the toes

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.040 
transformation whatsoever then the toes
they<00:04:58.970> can<00:04:59.090> kind<00:04:59.210> of<00:04:59.300> go<00:04:59.390> up<00:04:59.420> and<00:04:59.630> down<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.810> bit

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
they can kind of go up and down a bit

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.080 
they can kind of go up and down a bit
because<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.470> transformation<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.400> if<00:05:01.760> you

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
because of the transformation so if you

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.490 
because of the transformation so if you
want<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:02.540> can<00:05:02.630> get<00:05:02.810> some<00:05:03.020> kind<00:05:03.230> of<00:05:03.350> dynamic

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
want you can get some kind of dynamic

it down like a Autobots face or
something<00:05:13.640> you<00:05:14.030> can<00:05:14.150> get<00:05:14.270> some<00:05:14.450> kind<00:05:14.660> of<00:05:14.750> cool

poses<00:05:15.080> out<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.440> them<00:05:15.530> especially<00:05:15.650> if<00:05:15.920> you<00:05:16.010> mess

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
poses out of them especially if you mess

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.710 
poses out of them especially if you mess
around<00:05:16.670> with<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.150> little<00:05:17.180> bit<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.600> can

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
around with it a little bit you can

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.220 
around with it a little bit you can
probably<00:05:17.960> get<00:05:18.170> them<00:05:18.200> I<00:05:19.660> would<00:05:20.660> definitely<00:05:20.810> say

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
probably get them I would definitely say

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.500 
probably get them I would definitely say
that<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:22.040> wings<00:05:22.550> back<00:05:22.850> here<00:05:23.300> definitely

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
that the wings back here definitely

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.410 
that the wings back here definitely
limit<00:05:23.960> what<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.680> arms<00:05:25.430> have<00:05:25.700> as<00:05:25.910> far<00:05:26.150> as<00:05:26.270> the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
limit what the arms have as far as the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.930 
limit what the arms have as far as the
range<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.840> motion<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:28.520> other<00:05:28.670> thing<00:05:28.910> that

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
range of motion the other thing that

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.060 
range of motion the other thing that
really<00:05:29.420> I<00:05:29.870> got<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.380> say<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.800> biggest

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
really I got to say is the biggest

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.880 
really I got to say is the biggest
drawback<00:05:31.790> of<00:05:31.820> all<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.300> these<00:05:32.440> figures<00:05:33.440> there's

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
drawback of all of these figures there's

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.550 
drawback of all of these figures there's
quite<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.190> few<00:05:34.810> transformers<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:36.020> Decepticons

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
quite a few transformers the Decepticons

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.160 
quite a few transformers the Decepticons
based<00:05:36.860> on<00:05:37.040> this<00:05:37.160> Starscream<00:05:37.670> body<00:05:37.910> is<00:05:38.170> the

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
based on this Starscream body is the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.760 
based on this Starscream body is the
fact<00:05:39.650> that<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:39.830> does<00:05:40.070> not<00:05:40.250> have<00:05:40.610> any<00:05:40.850> rotating

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
fact that it does not have any rotating

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.890 
fact that it does not have any rotating
motion<00:05:42.770> in<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:44.240> guess<00:05:44.570> would<00:05:44.660> be<00:05:44.720> the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
motion in the I guess would be the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.350 
motion in the I guess would be the
forums<00:05:45.230> around<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.620> elbow<00:05:45.800> area<00:05:46.160> because<00:05:47.120> I

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
forums around the elbow area because I

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.730 
forums around the elbow area because I
mean<00:05:47.600> this<00:05:47.750> is<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:48.080> right<00:05:48.230> here<00:05:48.290> you<00:05:48.590> can<00:05:48.710> just

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
mean this is it right here you can just

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.410 
mean this is it right here you can just
like<00:05:49.040> shake<00:05:49.310> his<00:05:49.460> fist<00:05:49.490> at<00:05:49.850> you<00:05:49.880> but<00:05:50.120> he<00:05:50.210> can't

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
like shake his fist at you but he can't

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.420 
like shake his fist at you but he can't
rotate<00:05:50.960> his<00:05:51.410> arm<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:51.830> I<00:05:51.860> think<00:05:52.070> if<00:05:52.160> he<00:05:52.310> could

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
rotate his arm and I think if he could

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.920 
rotate his arm and I think if he could
rotate<00:05:52.640> his<00:05:53.000> arm<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.390> little<00:05:53.660> bit<00:05:53.810> it

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
rotate his arm just a little bit it

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.540 
rotate his arm just a little bit it
would<00:05:54.020> add<00:05:54.170> up<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:54.620> much<00:05:54.860> more<00:05:55.160> as<00:05:55.280> far<00:05:55.460> as

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
would add up so much more as far as

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.250 
would add up so much more as far as
poses<00:05:55.970> and<00:05:56.120> stop<00:05:56.300> merchantability<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.020> just

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
poses and stop merchantability and just

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.710 
poses and stop merchantability and just
and<00:05:57.890> you<00:05:58.130> know<00:05:58.220> just<00:05:58.400> everything<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.450> think<00:05:59.660> it

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
and you know just everything I think it

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.810 
and you know just everything I think it
would<00:05:59.810> be<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.900> lot<00:06:00.050> better<00:06:00.370> paint<00:06:01.370> job<00:06:01.580> on<00:06:01.670> this

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
would be a lot better paint job on this

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.350 
would be a lot better paint job on this
figure<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.680> standard<00:06:03.680> Hasbro<00:06:04.310> blah<00:06:04.760> it's<00:06:05.120> not

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
figure is standard Hasbro blah it's not

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.960 
figure is standard Hasbro blah it's not
wonderful<00:06:05.810> but<00:06:06.170> it's<00:06:06.440> it's<00:06:07.040> passable<00:06:07.610> it's

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
wonderful but it's it's passable it's

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.190 
wonderful but it's it's passable it's
way<00:06:08.270> better<00:06:08.300> than<00:06:08.600> anything<00:06:08.960> that's<00:06:09.080> in<00:06:09.170> the

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
way better than anything that's in the

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.300 
way better than anything that's in the
dollar<00:06:09.380> store<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.770> makes<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.010> sound<00:06:10.070> really

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
dollar store that makes it sound really

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.330 
dollar store that makes it sound really
bad<00:06:10.520> but<00:06:10.760> what<00:06:11.270> I<00:06:11.300> mean<00:06:11.540> is<00:06:11.780> it's<00:06:12.160> simple<00:06:13.160> it's

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
bad but what I mean is it's simple it's

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.550 
bad but what I mean is it's simple it's
not<00:06:13.550> there's<00:06:13.940> not<00:06:14.060> layers<00:06:14.480> of<00:06:14.840> colors<00:06:15.200> to<00:06:15.380> kind

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
not there's not layers of colors to kind

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.790 
not there's not layers of colors to kind
of<00:06:15.620> really<00:06:15.800> make<00:06:16.010> things<00:06:16.270> pop<00:06:17.270> it's<00:06:18.200> very<00:06:18.500> just

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
of really make things pop it's very just

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.550 
of really make things pop it's very just
a<00:06:18.920> simple<00:06:19.310> standard<00:06:19.700> paint<00:06:20.120> job<00:06:20.360> so<00:06:20.990> yeah

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
a simple standard paint job so yeah

overall I'm going to give the figure a 4

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.230 
overall I'm going to give the figure a 4
out<00:06:24.260> of<00:06:24.320> 5<00:06:24.620> I<00:06:24.920> probably<00:06:25.520> might<00:06:25.940> give<00:06:26.120> him<00:06:26.180> a

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
out of 5 I probably might give him a

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.220 
out of 5 I probably might give him a
three<00:06:26.420> and<00:06:26.480> a<00:06:26.540> half<00:06:26.570> but<00:06:26.750> I'm<00:06:26.870> gonna<00:06:26.990> go<00:06:27.050> with<00:06:27.140> a

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.160 
for the reason I cannot give him a 5 out
of<00:06:29.390> 5<00:06:29.510> is<00:06:29.900> because<00:06:30.380> of<00:06:30.410> the<00:06:30.590> arms<00:06:30.980> and<00:06:31.420> the<00:06:32.420> just

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
of 5 is because of the arms and the just

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.720 
of 5 is because of the arms and the just
the<00:06:33.260> lack<00:06:33.440> of<00:06:33.470> motion<00:06:34.010> that<00:06:34.040> he<00:06:34.160> can<00:06:34.400> do<00:06:34.520> really

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
the lack of motion that he can do really

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.430 
the lack of motion that he can do really
with<00:06:34.880> his<00:06:35.030> arms<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.420> knees<00:06:35.660> add<00:06:35.990> a<00:06:36.050> lot

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
with his arms the knees add a lot

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.430 
with his arms the knees add a lot
because<00:06:37.100> they<00:06:37.400> can<00:06:37.550> rotate<00:06:38.000> so<00:06:38.690> the<00:06:39.020> knees<00:06:39.230> out

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
because they can rotate so the knees out

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.920 
because they can rotate so the knees out
a<00:06:39.500> lot<00:06:39.740> as<00:06:39.890> far<00:06:39.920> as<00:06:40.160> the<00:06:40.430> articular

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
a lot as far as the articular

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.600 
a lot as far as the articular
asian<00:06:41.139> in<00:06:41.289> the<00:06:41.470> legs<00:06:41.680> to<00:06:41.860> be<00:06:41.949> able<00:06:42.009> to<00:06:42.130> pose<00:06:42.370> him

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
asian in the legs to be able to pose him

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.400 
asian in the legs to be able to pose him
better<00:06:42.789> but<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.120> honors<00:06:43.449> just<00:06:43.810> instantly

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
better but the honors just instantly

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.460 
better but the honors just instantly
limit<00:06:44.860> it<00:06:45.090> so<00:06:46.090> that<00:06:46.300> is<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.509> real<00:06:46.840> big<00:06:47.050> drawback

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
limit it so that is a real big drawback

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.710 
limit it so that is a real big drawback
for<00:06:47.710> me<00:06:47.770> but<00:06:48.130> he<00:06:48.280> is<00:06:48.370> an<00:06:48.490> awesome<00:06:48.699> figure<00:06:49.330> he's
