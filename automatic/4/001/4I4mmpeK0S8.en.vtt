transformers you know tens interrupt my

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.920 
transformers you know tens interrupt my
Gundam<00:04:38.250> building<00:04:38.610> sometimes<00:04:38.970> because<00:04:39.810> I'm

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
Gundam building sometimes because I'm

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.350 
Gundam building sometimes because I'm
doing<00:04:40.139> reviews<00:04:40.349> on<00:04:40.590> transformers<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.360> that's

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
get master great kids building a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.159 
get master great kids building a
reasonable<00:04:50.340> amount<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.610> time<00:04:50.699> but<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.990> digress

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
reasonable amount of time but I digress

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.249 
reasonable amount of time but I digress
the<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.160> main<00:04:53.310> question<00:04:53.669> for<00:04:54.180> this<00:04:54.389> video<00:04:55.020> is

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
the the main question for this video is

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.830 
the the main question for this video is
you<00:04:56.009> know<00:04:56.099> do<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.430> build<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.880> certain<00:04:57.330> scale

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
you know do you build a certain scale

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.249 
you know do you build a certain scale
model<00:04:58.319> kit<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.710> why<00:04:59.069> and<00:04:59.720> then<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.900> second

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
model kit and why and then the second

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.379 
model kit and why and then the second
sort<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.800> part<00:05:01.979> would<00:05:02.159> be<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.729> if<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.120> build

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
sort of part would be so if you build

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.499 
sort of part would be so if you build
model<00:05:03.780> kits<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.319> even<00:05:05.000> consider<00:05:06.000> or<00:05:06.300> have

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
model kits do you even consider or have

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.480 
model kits do you even consider or have
you<00:05:06.690> bought<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.770> know<00:05:07.889> mobile<00:05:08.220> suit<00:05:08.400> in

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
you bought you know mobile suit in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.620 
you bought you know mobile suit in
action<00:05:08.880> or<00:05:09.030> robot<00:05:09.360> spirits<00:05:09.599> action<00:05:10.080> figures
