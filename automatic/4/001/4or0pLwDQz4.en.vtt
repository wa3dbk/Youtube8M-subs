so<00:03:43.769> much<00:03:43.980> because<00:03:44.430> because<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.390> only

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
so much because because it's not only

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.440 
so much because because it's not only
good<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:46.079> short<00:03:46.560> range<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.099> good<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:47.700> long

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
good at short range it's good at long

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.920 
good at short range it's good at long
range<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:49.019> well<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:50.370> most<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.790> my<00:03:50.849> kills<00:03:51.209> well

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
range as well like most of my kills well

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.199 
range as well like most of my kills well
not<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.319> clip<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:52.890> some<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.280> my<00:03:53.370> kills<00:03:53.610> on

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
not in this clip but some of my kills on

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.979 
not in this clip but some of my kills on
this<00:03:54.840> map<00:03:55.079> are<00:03:56.090> pretty<00:03:57.090> long<00:03:57.299> ranged<00:03:57.750> like

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
this map are pretty long ranged like

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.530 
this map are pretty long ranged like
across<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.650> whole<00:03:58.799> entire<00:03:59.040> map<00:03:59.340> and<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
across the whole entire map and the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.539 
across the whole entire map and the
reason<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.409> because<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:02.069> UMP<00:04:02.400> is

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
reason I like that is because on UMP is

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.910 
reason I like that is because on UMP is
really<00:04:03.269> hard<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.629> get<00:04:03.780> long-range<00:04:04.620> kills

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
really hard to get long-range kills

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.470 
really hard to get long-range kills
across<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> map<00:04:05.489> because<00:04:05.790> well<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.299> not

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
across the map because well it's not

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.589 
across the map because well it's not
made<00:04:06.840> for<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.590> not<00:04:07.849> made<00:04:08.849> for<00:04:09.120> long

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
made for that it's not made for long

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.580 
made for that it's not made for long
range<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> short<00:04:10.769> range<00:04:10.980> gun<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:12.590> anyways

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
range it's a short range gun but anyways

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.629 
range it's a short range gun but anyways
back<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.370> ACR<00:04:15.530> most<00:04:16.530> kills<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
back to the ACR most kills you can get a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.000 
back to the ACR most kills you can get a
medium<00:04:18.209> range<00:04:18.449> will<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.750> about<00:04:19.109> seven<00:04:19.799> bullets

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
medium range will be about seven bullets

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.870 
medium range will be about seven bullets
to<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.910> torso<00:04:21.180> area<00:04:21.570> or<00:04:21.989> less<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:23.310> very

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
to the torso area or less this very

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.510 
to the torso area or less this very
rarely<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.570> more<00:04:24.810> than<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.280> but<00:04:26.280> right

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
rarely it's more than that but right

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.090 
rarely it's more than that but right
here<00:04:26.699> we've<00:04:27.060> got<00:04:27.090> my<00:04:27.330> AC<00:04:27.539> 130<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.889> we're<00:04:29.010> gonna

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
here we've got my AC 130 so we're gonna

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.450 
here we've got my AC 130 so we're gonna
pull<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.370> out<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.789> here<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.810> we're<00:04:31.139> just<00:04:31.260> gonna

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
pull it out of here and we're just gonna

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.839 
pull it out of here and we're just gonna
rain<00:04:32.460> fire<00:04:33.000> everywhere<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:35.400> like<00:04:35.430> matcha

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
rain fire everywhere just like matcha

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.329 
rain fire everywhere just like matcha
that's<00:04:37.419> just<00:04:37.659> good<00:04:38.369> but<00:04:39.369> um<00:04:39.809> for<00:04:40.809> my<00:04:41.129> ACR<00:04:42.129> i'm

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:42.339 
that's just good but um for my ACR i'm

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.629 
that's just good but um for my ACR i'm
using<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.479> kick<00:04:43.809> kirk<00:04:44.559> will<00:04:45.009> not<00:04:45.189> perk<00:04:45.429> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
using the kick kirk will not perk the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.529 
using the kick kirk will not perk the
proficiency<00:04:46.300> which<00:04:47.020> reduces<00:04:47.529> recoil<00:04:47.770> and

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
proficiency which reduces recoil and

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.809 
proficiency which reduces recoil and
that's<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:50.080> reason<00:04:50.589> I<00:04:50.770> use<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.399> because

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
that's the reason I use that is because

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.760 
that's the reason I use that is because
I<00:04:52.119> like<00:04:52.719> it<00:04:52.869> a<00:04:52.899> lot<00:04:53.020> better<00:04:53.259> than<00:04:53.529> all<00:04:53.619> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
I like it a lot better than all the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.350 
I like it a lot better than all the
other<00:04:53.889> ones<00:04:54.159> because<00:04:54.789> it<00:04:54.969> actually<00:04:55.119> has

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
other ones because it actually has

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.239 
other ones because it actually has
purpose<00:04:55.779> and<00:04:55.959> all<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.139> other<00:04:56.289> ones<00:04:56.469> I<00:04:56.619> just<00:04:56.679> I

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
purpose and all the other ones I just I

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.389 
purpose and all the other ones I just I
can't<00:04:58.089> relate<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.389> them<00:04:58.659> at<00:04:58.809> all<00:04:58.869> and<00:04:59.399> that's

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:00.399 
can't relate to them at all and that's

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.209 
can't relate to them at all and that's
why<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:00.639> don't<00:05:00.999> use<00:05:01.149> them<00:05:01.619> but<00:05:02.619> i'm<00:05:02.860> also<00:05:03.069> using

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
why I don't use them but i'm also using

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.329 
why I don't use them but i'm also using
the<00:05:03.550> red<00:05:03.819> dot<00:05:04.089> scope<00:05:04.330> red<00:05:05.169> dot<00:05:05.379> sight<00:05:05.800> actually

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:06.339 
the red dot scope red dot sight actually

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.959 
the red dot scope red dot sight actually
not<00:05:06.550> scope<00:05:06.869> and<00:05:07.869> i'm<00:05:08.499> using<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:09.339> mil<00:05:09.580> dot<00:05:09.759> i

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
not scope and i'm using the mil dot i

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.279 
not scope and i'm using the mil dot i
think<00:05:10.389> on<00:05:10.809> it<00:05:10.869> and<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:12.009> like<00:05:12.249> that<00:05:12.279> a<00:05:12.459> lot<00:05:13.080> even<00:05:14.080> I

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
think on it and I like that a lot even I

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.679 
think on it and I like that a lot even I
mean<00:05:14.589> I<00:05:14.619> do<00:05:14.830> like<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.099> stock<00:05:15.490> sites<00:05:15.819> but<00:05:16.360> I

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
mean I do like the stock sites but I

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.559 
mean I do like the stock sites but I
like<00:05:16.959> this<00:05:17.080> one<00:05:17.139> a<00:05:17.289> lot<00:05:17.349> better<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:19.240> anyways

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569
