00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and you can shoot it multiple ways how

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.630 
and you can shoot it multiple ways how
are<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> shoot<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.980> today<00:00:26.250> well

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
are you going to shoot this today well

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.339 
are you going to shoot this today well
there's<00:00:27.029> there's<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.510> ways<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.109> about

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
there's there's two ways to think about

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859 
there's there's two ways to think about
this<00:00:28.680> stage<00:00:28.920> mark<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
this stage mark you can you have to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.010 
this stage mark you can you have to
evaluate<00:00:31.080> risk<00:00:31.619> versus<00:00:31.980> reward<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.020> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
evaluate risk versus reward right and so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.319 
evaluate risk versus reward right and so
if<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.829> interested<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.579> shooting<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
if if I'm interested in shooting this

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.470 
if if I'm interested in shooting this
and<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.829> time<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.070> possible<00:00:38.790> trying<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and as little time as possible trying to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
and as little time as possible trying to
shoot<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.989> strong<00:00:40.320> classifier<00:00:40.980> I'm

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
shoot a really strong classifier I'm

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
shoot a really strong classifier I'm
gonna<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:42.600> risk<00:00:42.809> here

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

anywhere or one in the middle so the
safe<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> shoot<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> stage<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> shoot

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
safe way to shoot the stage is to shoot

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
safe way to shoot the stage is to shoot
is<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> load<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.320> slugs<00:01:40.710> shoot<00:01:41.520> each<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
is to load for slugs shoot each of the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
is to load for slugs shoot each of the
paper<00:01:42.060> targets<00:01:42.540> twice<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.530> issue<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.979> you've

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
paper targets twice the issue is you've

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
paper targets twice the issue is you've
got<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.460> extra<00:01:44.790> couple<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> seconds<00:01:45.479> loading

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
got an extra couple of seconds loading

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.889 
got an extra couple of seconds loading
an<00:01:45.990> extra<00:01:46.920> second<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.759> each<00:01:47.970> target<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
an extra second or so on each target so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
an extra second or so on each target so
I<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:49.590> expect<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.369> four<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.729> four

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I would expect to be about four or four

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060 
I would expect to be about four or four
and<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> half<00:01:51.119> seconds<00:01:51.659> slower<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.530> shooting

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and a half seconds slower or shooting

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
and a half seconds slower or shooting
this<00:01:53.220> stage<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.060> safe<00:01:54.329> way<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.930> were

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this stage the safe way and you were

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.300 
this stage the safe way and you were
going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> show<00:01:55.470> us<00:01:55.649> how<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> shoot<00:01:56.100> it
