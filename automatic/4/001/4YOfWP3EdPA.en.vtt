pumpkin<00:01:45.539> pie<00:01:45.869> filling<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pumpkin pie filling and so you want to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
pumpkin pie filling and so you want to
be<00:01:47.700> careful<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.450> sure<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.930> getting

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
be careful and make sure you're getting

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
be careful and make sure you're getting
just<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> canned<00:01:50.340> pumpkin<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.300> pumpkin

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just the canned pumpkin not the pumpkin

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
just the canned pumpkin not the pumpkin
pie<00:01:52.170> filling<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> difference

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
pie filling there is a difference

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.960

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
so the cans look almost identical so

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
so the cans look almost identical so
just<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:00.810> says<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
just look for the one that says a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
just look for the one that says a
hundred<00:02:01.320> percent<00:02:01.470> pure<00:02:01.979> pumpkin<00:02:02.039> that's<00:02:02.700> what
