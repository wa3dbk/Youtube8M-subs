00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
some of the stuff from ODST but

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.510 
some of the stuff from ODST but
basically<00:05:11.789> times<00:05:12.060> 5<00:05:12.830> Street<00:05:13.830> prancing<00:05:16.159> so<00:05:17.159> I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
basically times 5 Street prancing so I

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.219 
basically times 5 Street prancing so I
think<00:05:17.639> at<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.300> point<00:05:18.360> what<00:05:18.839> I'm<00:05:18.900> going<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.050> do

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
think at this point what I'm going to do

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.480 
think at this point what I'm going to do
is<00:05:19.589> switch<00:05:20.580> over<00:05:20.879> to<00:05:21.349> shifting<00:05:22.349> right<00:05:23.039> exit

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
is switch over to shifting right exit

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.599 
is switch over to shifting right exit
Brian's<00:05:23.759> going<00:05:23.879> to<00:05:23.969> do<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.089> little<00:05:24.240> bit
