00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.900 
this video I'm going to show you a tree
that<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> grew<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:14.040> loaded<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.670> peaches

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that I grew that was loaded with peaches

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.760 
that I grew that was loaded with peaches
we<00:00:15.240> actually<00:00:15.660> required<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> peaches

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770

we actually required some of the peaches
this<00:00:17.010> year<00:00:18.199> by<00:00:19.199> getting<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.680> before<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
this year by getting them before the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.769 
this year by getting them before the
squirrels<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:20.910> him<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.539> could<00:00:21.689> have

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
squirrels got him and we could have

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.720 
squirrels got him and we could have
actually<00:00:22.140> probably<00:00:22.500> gotten<00:00:23.010> all<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.609> them

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
actually probably gotten all of them

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.029 
actually probably gotten all of them
this<00:00:23.880> year<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.750> didn't<00:00:25.109> realize<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.890> they

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this year we just didn't realize if they

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
this year we just didn't realize if they
were<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> peaches<00:00:27.660> I'm

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
were right because the peaches I'm

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
were right because the peaches I'm
growing<00:00:28.320> never<00:00:29.039> change<00:00:29.640> colors<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
growing never change colors they just

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.709 
growing never change colors they just
stay<00:00:30.630> green<00:00:31.250> any<00:00:32.250> case<00:00:32.489> we'll<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.540> there

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
stay green any case we'll go out there

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.940 
stay green any case we'll go out there
and<00:00:33.809> take<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.230> peach<00:00:34.440> tree<00:00:34.710> right

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and take a look at that peach tree right

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
and take a look at that peach tree right
now<00:00:36.050> alright<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> peach<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
now alright here here is a peach that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020 
now alright here here is a peach that
was<00:00:39.660> grown<00:00:39.930> from<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> peach<00:00:40.500> pit<00:00:40.850> it's<00:00:41.850> not

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
was grown from a peach pit it's not

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.680 
was grown from a peach pit it's not
doing<00:00:42.300> too<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.670> makes<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> probably

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
doing too good but it makes it probably

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
doing too good but it makes it probably
survived<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.620> been<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> ground<00:00:46.980> for

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
survived it's been in the ground for

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.819 
survived it's been in the ground for
about<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> year<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.200> it's<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.410> hanging<00:00:49.620> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
about a year and it's still hanging on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
about a year and it's still hanging on
to<00:00:49.860> life<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.430> there<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> still<00:00:51.030> hope<00:00:51.059> but

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to life so there is still hope but

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.830 
to life so there is still hope but
here's<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.320> peach<00:00:52.800> pit<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:54.210> originally

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
here's my peach pit that we originally

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.260 
here's my peach pit that we originally

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
planted maybe five years ago and we just
we<00:01:00.539> didn't<00:01:00.750> even<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.440> plant<00:01:01.710> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
was watching him I wasn't watching him

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
was watching him I wasn't watching him
diligently<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.700> I'd<00:01:32.820> come<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.420> once

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
diligently but I'd come out about once

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.270 
diligently but I'd come out about once
every<00:01:33.900> four<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.140> five<00:01:34.259> days<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
every four or five days and look and the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.690 
every four or five days and look and the
peaches<00:01:35.490> would<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.880> green<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.159> would

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
peaches would be green and so I would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
peaches would be green and so I would
just<00:01:38.729> leave<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> hope<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
just leave them and hope that the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.870 
just leave them and hope that the
squirrels<00:01:40.740> didn't<00:01:41.100> find<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
squirrels didn't find him and that was a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
squirrels didn't find him and that was a
big<00:01:42.150> topic<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.720> conversation<00:01:42.780> around<00:01:43.770> our

last time I checked I skipped about five
days<00:01:52.680> before<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.220> checked<00:01:53.520> again<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.140> there

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
days before I checked again and there

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
days before I checked again and there
were<00:01:55.229> only<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.890> twenty<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.909> thirty<00:01:57.630> peaches

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
were only about twenty or thirty peaches

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
were only about twenty or thirty peaches
left<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> tree<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.549> were<00:01:59.610> still

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
left on the tree and they were still

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.499 
left on the tree and they were still
green<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> thought<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> time

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
green so I thought there that was a time

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
green so I thought there that was a time
to<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> decision<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.350> had<00:02:04.500> either<00:02:04.710> pick'em

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to make a decision I had either pick'em

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.850 
to make a decision I had either pick'em
green

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
green

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.190 
green
or<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.910> leave<00:02:08.300> them<00:02:08.509> on<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.720> tree<00:02:08.930> for<00:02:08.960> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
or just leave them on the tree for the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.870 
or just leave them on the tree for the
squirrels<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.860> reached<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.460> pick<00:02:10.670> one

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
squirrels so I reached up to pick one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.690 
squirrels so I reached up to pick one
and<00:02:11.150> when<00:02:11.960> I<00:02:11.990> did<00:02:12.320> about<00:02:12.800> 10<00:02:13.130> peaches<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and when I did about 10 peaches just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.450 
and when I did about 10 peaches just
fell<00:02:14.180> off<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.870> me<00:02:15.170> shaking<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> tree<00:02:16.250> and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
fell off from me shaking the tree and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.800 
fell off from me shaking the tree and
this<00:02:16.760> peach<00:02:17.210> was<00:02:17.660> really<00:02:18.260> soft<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.270> picked

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
this peach was really soft so I picked

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
another peach tree that I grew from a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.420 
another peach tree that I grew from a
peach<00:02:26.060> pit<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:27.500> has<00:02:27.890> been<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.220> ground

Florida Queen will grow here but those
two<00:03:16.880> varieties<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.750> these<00:03:18.230> grow<00:03:18.620> small

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
two varieties like these grow small

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.840 
two varieties like these grow small
peaches<00:03:19.340> maybe<00:03:19.640> not<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:20.000> small<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:21.850> from

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
peaches maybe not this small and from

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.180 
peaches maybe not this small and from
what<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.090> understand<00:03:23.600> they<00:03:24.290> will<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.860> put<00:03:25.070> on

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
what I understand they will not put on

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.100 
what I understand they will not put on
fruit<00:03:25.489> unless<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.060> spray<00:03:26.360> poison<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.019> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
fruit unless you spray poison on the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.400 
fruit unless you spray poison on the
tree<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:27.650> before<00:03:28.070> your<00:03:28.400> trees<00:03:29.060> make<00:03:29.900> flowers

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
tree so before your trees make flowers

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.229 
tree so before your trees make flowers
you<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.160> spray<00:03:31.370> poison<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.940> don't<00:03:32.090> want

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
you have to spray poison you don't want

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.420 
you have to spray poison you don't want
to<00:03:32.300> poison<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.690> flowers<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.160> don't<00:03:34.310> want

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
to poison the flowers and you don't want

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.009 
to poison the flowers and you don't want
to<00:03:34.459> poison<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.940> bees<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.150> pollinate<00:03:35.570> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
to poison the bees that pollinate the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.570 
to poison the bees that pollinate the
flowers<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.680> you've<00:03:36.860> got<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.190> spray<00:03:37.430> before

flowers so you've got to spray before
they<00:03:37.820> put<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.060> flowers<00:03:38.450> then<00:03:39.350> after<00:03:39.680> they<00:03:39.769> put

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
they put on flowers then after they put

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.550 
they put on flowers then after they put

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.540 
process that I'm going to talk about is
called<00:05:39.650> stratification<00:05:40.650> now<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.220> can't

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
called stratification now I can't

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.370 
called stratification now I can't
testify<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.690> works<00:05:42.900> or<00:05:43.080> doesn't<00:05:43.229> work

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
testify that it works or doesn't work

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.170 
testify that it works or doesn't work
because<00:05:43.680> every<00:05:44.100> seed<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.610> have<00:05:44.880> that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
because every seed that I have that

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.080 
because every seed that I have that
requires<00:05:45.510> stratification<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.530> do<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.729> so<00:05:48.060> I

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
requires stratification I do it and so I

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.140 
requires stratification I do it and so I
don't<00:05:48.510> know<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:49.620> can<00:05:50.370> get<00:05:50.669> away<00:05:50.880> without

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
don't know if you can get away without

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.330 
don't know if you can get away without
doing<00:05:51.479> it<00:05:51.600> although<00:05:51.870> all<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.919> peaches<00:05:53.130> that

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
doing it although all the peaches that

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.370 
doing it although all the peaches that
are<00:05:53.610> in<00:05:53.729> my<00:05:53.910> yard<00:05:54.150> have<00:05:54.510> come<00:05:54.750> up<00:05:54.900> on<00:05:55.110> their<00:05:55.350> own

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
are in my yard have come up on their own

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.260 
are in my yard have come up on their own
I<00:05:55.800> don't<00:05:56.100> know<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.610> they<00:05:56.789> were<00:05:56.850> not

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
I don't know that they were not

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.230 
I don't know that they were not
stratified<00:05:58.050> by<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.100> natural<00:05:59.580> processes<00:06:00.060> of

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
stratified by the natural processes of

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.960 
stratified by the natural processes of
going<00:06:00.690> through<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.900> winter<00:06:01.140> or<00:06:01.320> not<00:06:01.470> because<00:06:01.830> I

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
going through a winter or not because I

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.040 
going through a winter or not because I
didn't<00:06:02.970> keep<00:06:03.090> track<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.510> all<00:06:03.600> that<00:06:03.660> didn't

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
didn't keep track of all that didn't

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.690 
didn't keep track of all that didn't
even<00:06:04.140> wasn't<00:06:04.500> even<00:06:04.650> aware<00:06:04.830> of<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.220> peach<00:06:05.400> pit

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
even wasn't even aware of the peach pit

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.040 
even wasn't even aware of the peach pit
that<00:06:05.940> grew<00:06:06.120> into<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.419> big<00:06:06.570> tree<00:06:06.780> in<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.930> front

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
that grew into the big tree in the front

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.990 
that grew into the big tree in the front
being<00:06:07.890> there<00:06:08.160> so<00:06:08.310> it<00:06:08.460> may<00:06:08.580> have<00:06:08.700> been<00:06:08.789> there<00:06:08.940> a

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
being there so it may have been there a

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.330 
being there so it may have been there a
couple<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.330> years<00:06:09.479> before<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:09.960> sprouted<00:06:10.380> but

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
couple of years before it sprouted but

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.250 
couple of years before it sprouted but
anyways<00:06:11.669> what<00:06:12.570> you're<00:06:12.660> going<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.840> do<00:06:12.930> and

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
big deal don't taste any different than

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.820 
big deal don't taste any different than
a<00:06:41.520> regular<00:06:41.580> peach<00:06:42.230> but<00:06:43.230> anyways<00:06:43.530> that's<00:06:43.710> what

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
a regular peach but anyways that's what

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.200 
a regular peach but anyways that's what
it<00:06:43.920> looks<00:06:44.070> like<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.400> the<00:06:44.520> soil<00:06:44.790> that's<00:06:45.000> there

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
it looks like in the soil that's there

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.010 
it looks like in the soil that's there
is<00:06:45.450> just<00:06:45.660> slightly<00:06:45.960> moist<00:06:46.350> soil<00:06:46.710> to<00:06:47.960> kind<00:06:48.960> of

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
is just slightly moist soil to kind of

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.380 
is just slightly moist soil to kind of
mimic<00:06:49.410> what<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.430> conditions<00:06:50.940> would<00:06:51.060> be<00:06:51.120> if

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
mimic what the conditions would be if

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.580 
mimic what the conditions would be if
these<00:06:51.540> seeds<00:06:51.810> were<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.110> fall<00:06:52.320> on<00:06:52.470> the<00:06:52.530> ground

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
these seeds were to fall on the ground

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.940 
these seeds were to fall on the ground
and<00:06:52.920> get<00:06:53.040> covered<00:06:53.280> by<00:06:53.310> leaves<00:06:53.640> or<00:06:53.940> something

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
and get covered by leaves or something

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.840 
and get covered by leaves or something
anyway<00:06:55.950> that's<00:06:56.250> what<00:06:56.370> I'm<00:06:56.460> doing<00:06:56.730> and

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
anyway that's what I'm doing and

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.230 
anyway that's what I'm doing and
probably<00:06:57.000> every<00:06:57.750> time<00:06:58.110> I<00:06:58.140> dump<00:06:58.560> my<00:06:58.710> toilet

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
probably every time I dump my toilet

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.840 
probably every time I dump my toilet
which<00:07:00.240> I'll<00:07:00.420> show<00:07:00.630> you<00:07:00.660> that<00:07:01.280> my<00:07:02.280> toilet<00:07:02.700> is<00:07:02.820> a

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
which I'll show you that my toilet is a

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.360 
which I'll show you that my toilet is a
composting<00:07:03.780> toilet<00:07:03.810> which<00:07:04.380> basically<00:07:04.980> means

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
composting toilet which basically means

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.130 
composting toilet which basically means

throw<00:07:10.350> three<00:07:10.650> seeds<00:07:10.890> in<00:07:11.070> there<00:07:11.220> every<00:07:11.400> time<00:07:11.550> I

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
throw three seeds in there every time I

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.180 
throw three seeds in there every time I
dump<00:07:12.000> the<00:07:12.090> toilet<00:07:12.560> and<00:07:13.560> I'll<00:07:13.740> take<00:07:13.950> it<00:07:14.040> outside

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
dump the toilet and I'll take it outside

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.550 
dump the toilet and I'll take it outside
dig<00:07:14.820> a<00:07:14.850> little<00:07:15.000> hole<00:07:15.150> pour<00:07:15.810> that<00:07:15.960> in<00:07:16.230> put<00:07:16.470> the
