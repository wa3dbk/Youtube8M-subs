00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
full synthetic transmission flute we're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.110 
full synthetic transmission flute we're
gonna<00:00:13.170> stick<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.710> there<00:00:13.799> Dexter<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.639> six

and<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.809> need<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> put<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.400> friction<00:00:17.400> modifier<00:00:17.850> in

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and I need to put a friction modifier in

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849 
and I need to put a friction modifier in
it<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.390> well<00:00:18.539> well<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> normal

it as well well with the normal

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.200 
it as well well with the normal
transmission<00:00:20.310> fluid<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.850> friction

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
transmission fluid you put friction

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.140 
transmission fluid you put friction
modifier<00:00:21.630> I'm<00:00:21.960> pretty<00:00:22.289> sure<00:00:22.640> I'll<00:00:23.640> still<00:00:23.880> be

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
modifier I'm pretty sure I'll still be

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
modifier I'm pretty sure I'll still be
good<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.400> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
driveshaft tighten the bullets up so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
driveshaft tighten the bullets up so
we'll<00:01:25.080> come<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.909> okay<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> other

we'll come back to that okay the other

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.399 
we'll come back to that okay the other
thing<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.450> need<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> tighten<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
thing you need to tighten up was this

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
thing you need to tighten up was this
top<00:01:28.710> bolt<00:01:28.950> cuz<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.220> didn't<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> wrench<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
top bolt cuz I didn't have a wrench and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.950 
top bolt cuz I didn't have a wrench and
a<00:01:30.900> deep<00:01:31.110> 15<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> amount<00:01:33.780> for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
a deep 15 this is for the amount for

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.429 
a deep 15 this is for the amount for
your<00:01:34.049> lateral<00:01:34.439> torsion<00:01:35.130> bar<00:01:35.310> -<00:01:36.119> keeps<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> Rin

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
your lateral torsion bar - keeps the Rin

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
your lateral torsion bar - keeps the Rin
from<00:01:37.470> tipping<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> guess<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.150> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
from tipping on you I guess it's like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.490 
from tipping on you I guess it's like
having<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> traction<00:01:39.869> bar<00:01:40.490> kinda<00:01:41.490> sorta<00:01:42.500> for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
having a traction bar kinda sorta for

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.590 
having a traction bar kinda sorta for
the<00:01:43.560> driveshaft<00:01:46.070> kids<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.220> behaving<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.850> far

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.850 

as<00:01:53.600> they<00:01:53.720> continue<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.320> should<00:01:54.590> be<00:01:54.680> able<00:01:54.800> to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
as they continue I should be able to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.910 
as they continue I should be able to
finish<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.930> now<00:01:56.930> put<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.260> dry<00:01:57.410> shot<00:01:57.680> before

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
finish this now put the dry shot before

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.430 
finish this now put the dry shot before
I<00:01:58.070> put<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> X<00:01:58.460> frame<00:01:58.700> back<00:01:58.940> under<00:01:59.240> here<00:01:59.440> just

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
I put the X frame back under here just

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.920 
I put the X frame back under here just
so<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.560> could<00:02:00.620> get<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.980> up<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:01.310> easy

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
so I could get it up in there easy

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.830 
so I could get it up in there easy
now<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.590> should<00:02:03.860> check<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.370> gear<00:02:05.120> ratio<00:02:05.600> by

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
now I should check the gear ratio by

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.830 
now I should check the gear ratio by
counting<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.710> turns<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.250> how<00:02:07.310> many<00:02:07.490> turns<00:02:07.840> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
counting the turns and how many turns it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.110 
counting the turns and how many turns it
takes<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.259> turn<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.619> tire<00:02:09.860> around<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.850> one

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
takes to turn that tire around like one

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.010 
takes to turn that tire around like one
turn<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> tire<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.080> how<00:02:12.230> many<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:14.020> how

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
turn to the tire and how many of how

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.720 
turn to the tire and how many of how
many<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> pinion<00:02:15.740> gear<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:16.340> not<00:02:16.550> that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
many of the pinion gear but I'm not that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.550 
many of the pinion gear but I'm not that

measured in to start out with for a

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.050 
measured in to start out with for a
change<00:05:04.909> of<00:05:05.030> transmission

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
change of transmission

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.029 
change of transmission
so<00:05:08.060> what<00:05:08.750> happened<00:05:09.199> well<00:05:09.409> what<00:05:09.590> happened<00:05:09.919> as

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
so what happened well what happened as

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.860 
so what happened well what happened as
they<00:05:10.159> knocked<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.550> back<00:05:10.729> of<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.000> oil

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
they knocked the back of the oil

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.659 
they knocked the back of the oil
pressure<00:05:12.199> sensor<00:05:12.590> when<00:05:13.069> I<00:05:13.099> dropped<00:05:13.460> the

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
pressure sensor when I dropped the

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.209 
pressure sensor when I dropped the
transmission<00:05:14.300> because<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.289> sits<00:05:15.500> right<00:05:15.740> back

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
transmission because it sits right back

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.300 
transmission because it sits right back
in<00:05:16.520> here<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:17.990> know<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.379> I<00:05:18.650> can<00:05:18.979> feel<00:05:19.159> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
in here and I know it's I can feel it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.390 
in here and I know it's I can feel it
it's<00:05:19.460> loose<00:05:19.669> so<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.629> hit<00:05:20.719> the<00:05:20.840> firewall<00:05:21.349> so

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
it's loose so and it hit the firewall so

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.480 
it's loose so and it hit the firewall so
I<00:05:24.340> will<00:05:25.340> be<00:05:26.199> replacing<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.560> tomorrow<00:05:28.039> and
