00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.330
 hello everyone welcome again to me 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.879
 channel as you will see today I am in a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.219
 different scenario so good if you 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.630
 they hear things that should not be heard when they hear 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.210
 I'm so sorry I hope it was not 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.790
 many bumps noises voices but in short 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.290
 what this is a purchase video is 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.780
 Make up I have already divided it into two 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.640
 parties general purchases and 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.310
 purchases of the silent brand and if you do not know 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.840
 is makeup academy which is a brand that 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.210
 is now very fashionable because they have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.460
 brought to make up already and well I'm going to 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.070
 start first say this you are 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.980
 I made them because when I went to Spain 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.110
 to the semi-final in the Euro Cup or not to the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.540
 final was put shipping costs 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.550
 free in makeup and then I made a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.440
 asked for my boyfriend that things 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.230
 which starts should be of degree it and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.910
 then another one aside then good 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.760
 let's start and I'll teach you 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.690
 little things the first thing we bought was 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.160
 for him and it's a sandwich to be 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.489
 this is d 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.640
 the elite which is the one that is let's say more 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.500
 professional in the elite room and how 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 you will see it is a little different from what I 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.830
 I have to start the form is different 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 and as you can see here has a finish like that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.750
 As a piano, then they are also 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.979
 different has as the more 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 straight and they are more resistant I think that 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.760
 these are not going to last as easy as 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.500
 those that I have I have tried it I have 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.110
 tested dry but in the wet it has 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.670
 taken to the pool and the truth is that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.470
 I love I like it more than what I have 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.020
 me so when I place a new order 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.090
 either the official page or make up 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.909
 and then I'll have to order one for me 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.280
 price I think I remember it was about twelve 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.740
 euros more or less in makeup and good 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 because this is for him another thing that is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.080
 for him is this soothing theorist who is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.580
 from here that is blackberry and pomegranate is 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.440
 this 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.290
 as you know that this is a brand that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.210
 they sell make-up and that is for sale 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.110
 supposedly exclusive professional and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.100
 for beauty salons and spas this brings 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.170
 195 milliliters as you see there and has a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.070
 24 months quantity good very good and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.660
 this particular one we have bought 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.300
 to use it as 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 this 6 because being calming then 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 I suppose it will calm down because that redness 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.050
 the skin and also it will help you as 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.520
 all this surely that I will use it 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.980
 I 'll tell you sometime then 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.420
 how is it going and also I will tell you how 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.750
 is going to him for the use that we have 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.910
 bought specifically then he gave me 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.610
 two enamels one is this one of cuatris that 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.140
 It's super nice 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 exists here is from the collection 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 well I do not know with the collection but good 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.670
 it's this one that has the little birds here that 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.099
 its summer ships that I think there's a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.250
 pink tone even if a green is not blue 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.250
 yellow wine this is called bears flying 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 high and it's number 01 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 and good as you can see is this blue tone 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.020
 put space com in 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.580
 from the back and I suppose 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.520
 that being such a dark color because 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.740
 that's what the brush puts us is very good 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.140
 because it is very chubby I do not know if you are going to 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.600
 get it appreciate it be here 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.180
 and good now let's do a sample 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.370
 the color because I do not have here the rules 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.739
 but 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.709
 I will make a sample in the blog in the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.349
 I will go to an entrance accompanying 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.659
 what is this video with the purchases of the 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.840
 website another enamel that gave me 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.120
 it was this that is a craquelure and is of the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.340
 Chinese brand see you know that Chinese lis 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.379
 it is my favorite brand of glazes and good 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.250
 the truth is that the letters to be in 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.870
 so dark tone do not look good but it 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 supposed to make this effect that has 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.329
 here on the sticker and it's tone 980 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.329
 black more 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.890
 another thing 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.799
 of this order that this one I bought and 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.629
 if I bought it for my mother because I 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.590
 they sent the two orders together then 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.750
 well I teach everything in this video what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.630
 that is not demo and in the other what is 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.669
 that are different orders is a gloss 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.639
 of the stay with me you already know that 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.130
 I have used them that I bought them in 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.630
 the being in bodybell but good as this 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.460
 he asked us for makeup to burn and he 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.650
 already has a lot is an uncle of essence 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.820
 and they have almost all the collections on 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.310
 tone is the number 07 xxx and it's a red 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.870
 very very nice I thought it was a 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.449
 darker tone and pulling burgundy in 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.090
 the web looks a bit like that but it turns out 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.800
 that is a red you already know that I like 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.250
 a lot of these gloss is that is the sweet 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.190
 because they stay a lot on the lip and not 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.650
 it goes neither the brightness nor the color the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.330
 last two things that I bought were 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.330
 well rather I gave me my boyfriend 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.880
 they were two shades of jean of the color 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.740
 outside which are the ones that are neon 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.960
 are these here the truth is that the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.170
 camera does not do them much justice are 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.840
 more neon still and they are amazing because 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.400
 I do not know the last one that is the last one 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.650
 be taught to swipe and pigmented 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.360
 a lot was the black one of crío the cndh 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.360
 Well, I'm going to do a demonstration 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.860
 because it is exactly the same way of 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.689
 pigment this is the blue that is the 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.320
 number 575 blow 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:35.420
 and well what is a neon blue 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.310
 I'm here comes a little bit of touched in 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.470
 a corner but good has no major 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.050
 importance and look 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.380
 weisner neon and it is also that we put it 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.870
 in the hand and still pigmented with the 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.060
 Pink happens a little the same 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.070
 what a pigment an outrage this is the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.730
 pink I tell you that it was bed does not make 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.420
 justice is this here and as you see 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:03.360
 pigments a pass in the hand the same 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.120
 a lot of pigmentation the truth is that 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.710
 I was infatuated with them because we saw them 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.180
 as I was placing the order then in 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.669
 a promotion of these that put 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.650
 well that the images to promote 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.210
 the products within the web as the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.800
 I live if I liked those two 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.240
 colors there is a makeup that is on the 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.750
 makeup website has done with its two 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.330
 colors and I love I'm not saying to 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.490
 the prices of anything because I think that those 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.320
 about two euros and peak the gloss 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.680
 also the crack that the d 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.040
 china 65 euros and peak and enamel 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.110
 catriló 2 and peak the case tonic 6 with 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.840
 something and the sad also I told you 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.970
 and in mac italy apart from the teddy bears 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.730
 caribou that are very good and is a 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.980
 Detailed gift giving gave me this 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.590
 shadow of here the truth is that I do not know the 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.910
 mark this is a very nice blue one with 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:59.110
 silver reflections 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.700
 it's called credit color number 36 I do not know 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.620
 If it's from the brand itself, make up 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.160
 because it puts distributed by makeup and 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:09.250
 or if it will be from jilin or something like that I do not have 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.660
 no idea the truth comes like this in google and 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.660
 It has also surprised me because 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.110
 You see a lot of pigmentation besides 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.430
 they notice very much the glitter that in the 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.270
 shadows that have brilliants do not 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.770
 often notice and pigment a lot this type 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.419
 of details that have some pages 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.450
 web is what makes you decide 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.889
 for one or the other at the time of 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.810
 buy products other than prices 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.669
 but if they have similar prices as 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.260
 details like this and good because this has 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.950
 been the first part of the game of 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.720
 make up now and now I recorded the walt 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.610
 and so I hope you liked it 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.410
