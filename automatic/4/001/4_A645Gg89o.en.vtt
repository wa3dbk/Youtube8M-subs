00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.270
 video tutorial on how to take oleg from 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.380
 minecraft then the first of all i 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.350
 I'll show you what my minecraft is. 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.059
 before installing this beauty program the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.880
 minecraft looks like this when people 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.880
 low minecraft it looks like this 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.770
 catching a lot and this is kind of normal 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.220
 depending on their ability to 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.260
 capacity of your computer and I will 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:58.490
 teach to shoot and deny damn it 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.680
 teaches to take this leg and that's it 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.339
 The computer was good, you do not even need it. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 do nothing to take the lec already won 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.759
 None but in my case I have I had 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.549
 I install the program so I go 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.950
 teach you how to install the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.810
 beauty program 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.000
 Let's go and see a way that's stayed. 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.790
 right at the start, right? 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.650
 so let's start 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.750
 first of all I'll leave the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.640
 download it in the description of the video it is 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.440
 she is very light I think she has 200 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.100
 You're right if I'm not mistaken. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.460
 first you open your browser and glue 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.900
 The link that I left right there he calls 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 pop fine 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.720
 in my case it is a point 3.2 because of the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.010
 maine craft version 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.619
 so we download it right 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.360
 As always we open it here in my 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.500
 if I will play on desktop 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.150
 new 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 Okay, we'll do the following now. 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.780
 pay attention and if it is because of the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.849
 this is the case where windows serves beauty 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.150
 if you want do not do a tutorial 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:21.230
 for windows xp also beauty 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.200
 so here we start 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.660
 aunt we write percentage app date 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.599
 the percentage I'll leave there 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 description of the video if you leave it bad 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.790
 so the resolution but we will leave in the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.730
 registration as writes beauty 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.519
 We'll write that later. 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.120
 an enter will appear all this here 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.670
 seeing 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.760
 remembers the minecraft point folder that the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.700
 people created me when we 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.849
 people downloaded minecraft then 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.650
 first we enter it at some point 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.720
 Minecraft after we see it in bim 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.489
 then here's going to have a minecraft point 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.250
 I'll just have it, I think it's going to be here. 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:14.549

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.980
 We opened here. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.930
 boring message you close here folks 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.060
 Search on map 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:32.850

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:37.620
 Deleted it is there for her 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:41.130
 Right after we delete, we'll get that one. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.819
 stately home folder not that another file 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.980
 We have opted to open 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.810
 close the stitch bigger craft 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
 You see, it's boring here . 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.840
 new you date 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.220
 then you have to copy everything inside 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.459
 remember that this is not the file 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.709
 is the first is only the second to 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:10.799
 down from the nz awb be copied from it all 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:15.599
 Down here and you drag 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:19.380
 you're seeing drag to save you the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:23.990
 minecraft having drag will appear 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.539
 this message you give an ok look and 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.410
 ready your minecraft is already installed 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:35.100
 is already installed fine with the op 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.630
 Let's test it, then let's go. 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.220
 We are in the game here, my 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.000
 minecraft is crashing there is still a 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.030
 Little is because I'm recording the video 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.560
 beauty but your probably will not 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.150
 brake nothing 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.010
 another configuration that we have to 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.310
 do within the larger craft that is to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.710
 it does not lock we squeeze west here 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.200
 inside like they were in the game 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:06.130
 click video settings options 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.550
 in the chart we put it is fast that it is 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.780
 I do not know how it's going to be in the 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.700
 you 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.210
 Beauty is this is how are you going naked in 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.070
 details you do not move, just change the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:28.419
 graphic there leave it fast and I think it's just 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.729
 give a hoot here if you think any 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.850
 thing to brake if you have locked the 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:37.000
 people change here but it really helps 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:41.470
 enough is here because we have the 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.450
 close would be the quick and offensive 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.120
 would be a nice graphic only that this 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.030
 cute graphic it catches more beauty 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.090
 so we always leaving the fest is a 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:57.690
 A good gift depending on your mother grows 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.550
 have Portuguese version and only play 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.120
 follow my videos I always get 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:08.470
 felling as always does not fit into the 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:12.280
 channel of a jewel and beauty and that's it 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.120
 guys until next time until a next 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.010
 video 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.600
 remembering that I just put this video 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.600
 because I do not have any saved 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.310
 I still have to record myself playing some 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.300
 thing 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.300
