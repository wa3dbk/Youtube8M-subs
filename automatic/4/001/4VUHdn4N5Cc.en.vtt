00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
weeks actually look horrible to get we

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
weeks actually look horrible to get we
did<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.329> zapped<00:01:42.600> left<00:01:42.869> though<00:01:43.049> iterated<00:01:44.040> but

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
did get zapped left though iterated but

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.179 
did get zapped left though iterated but
goes<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.600> 600-700<00:01:45.600> coins<00:01:46.049> which<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
goes about 600-700 coins which is really

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.350 
goes about 600-700 coins which is really
really<00:01:47.340> bad<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.670> i<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:47.939> actually<00:01:48.030> try<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
really bad but i did actually try to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
really bad but i did actually try to
sell<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.750> contracts<00:01:49.290> scored<00:01:49.920> fitness's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
sell on the contracts scored fitness's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.969 
sell on the contracts scored fitness's
etc<00:01:50.729> etc<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.240> i<00:01:51.270> could<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.780> expand<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> coin

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
etc etc so i could try expand the coin

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
etc etc so i could try expand the coin
into<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.700> did<00:01:53.850> gage<00:01:54.000> shabby

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
into a little bit we did gage shabby

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
into a little bit we did gage shabby
garcia<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> i<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> last<00:01:55.799> pack<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
garcia and i think the last pack was the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.929 
garcia and i think the last pack was the
best<00:01:56.700> path<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.369> shiny<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.700> got

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
best path which was a shiny so got

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
best path which was a shiny so got
upgraded<00:02:00.060> cash<00:02:00.390> only<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> i<00:02:00.990> did<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.200> herself

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
upgraded cash only and i did at herself

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
upgraded cash only and i did at herself
for<00:02:01.649> addy<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.219> coins<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.149> has<00:02:03.240> all

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
for addy time out coins so that has all

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660 
for addy time out coins so that has all
the<00:02:03.420> five<00:02:03.600> packs<00:02:03.869> i<00:02:04.049> got<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> open<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.520> did

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the five packs i got to open and we did

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.670 
the five packs i got to open and we did
actually<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:06.060> about<00:02:06.240> twenty<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> twelve<00:02:07.439> k

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
actually make about twenty to twelve k

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.979 
actually make about twenty to twelve k
plus<00:02:08.190> six<00:02:08.369> tony<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:09.030> 15k<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.810> these

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
plus six tony was about 15k on these

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.330 
plus six tony was about 15k on these
packs<00:02:10.289> which<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.580> bad<00:02:11.640> um

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
packs which is not actually that bad um

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.759 
packs which is not actually that bad um
I<00:02:13.430> think<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.879> was<00:02:14.030> about<00:02:14.150> 12<00:02:14.900> 13<00:02:14.989> k<00:02:15.349> yet<00:02:15.530> but

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
I think it was about 12 13 k yet but

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.500 
I think it was about 12 13 k yet but
that<00:02:16.040> was<00:02:16.129> not<00:02:16.280> bad<00:02:16.489> hope<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.239> can<00:02:17.360> get<00:02:17.450> some

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that was not bad hope you can get some

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.089 
that was not bad hope you can get some
better<00:02:17.750> place<00:02:18.019> in<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> next<00:02:18.410> pack<00:02:18.680> openings

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
better place in the next pack openings

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.250 
better place in the next pack openings
and<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:20.000> guy<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.660> would<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:20.959> be

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and this guy this would actually be

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.809 
and this guy this would actually be
pretty<00:02:21.410> good<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:21.800> compact<00:02:22.129> some<00:02:22.400> really<00:02:22.700> good

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
pretty good if compact some really good

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.160 
pretty good if compact some really good
that<00:02:22.970> would<00:02:23.090> boost<00:02:23.420> his<00:02:23.629> little<00:02:23.840> bit<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.019> did

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that would boost his little bit we did

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.540 
that would boost his little bit we did
actually<00:02:24.290> sell<00:02:24.590> him<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.769> four<00:02:25.099> thousand<00:02:25.430> six

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
actually sell him on four thousand six

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.550 
actually sell him on four thousand six
hundred<00:02:25.580> coins<00:02:25.910> which<00:02:26.660> was<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> very<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.349> good

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
hundred coins which was a very very good

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890 
hundred coins which was a very very good
one<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.430> went<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.849> picked<00:02:29.150> up<00:02:29.330> three

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
one so we went and picked up three

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.740 
one so we went and picked up three
bronze<00:02:30.590> informs<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.269> reason<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.629> picked

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
bronze informs and the reason I picked

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.600 
bronze informs and the reason I picked
them<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:33.019> is<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:34.010> were<00:02:34.099> going<00:02:34.400> for

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
them up is because they were going for

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.180 
them up is because they were going for
round<00:02:35.000> about<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.450> think<00:02:35.900> someone<00:02:36.890> will<00:02:36.950> going

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
round about I think someone will going

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.339 
round about I think someone will going
back<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.549> 3k<00:02:37.940> cheaper<00:02:38.299> which<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.959> know<00:02:39.019> it's<00:02:39.260> not

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
back to 3k cheaper which I know it's not

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.570
