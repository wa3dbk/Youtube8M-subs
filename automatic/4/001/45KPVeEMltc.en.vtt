00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.690 
I made it's at the top so that's
positive<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:01.390> my<00:03:01.720> foot<00:03:01.960> kind<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.260> hurts<00:03:02.700> and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
it's cool to see and then they have the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.170 
it's cool to see and then they have the
bars<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.130> you're<00:03:15.430> supposed<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> like<00:03:15.970> flip

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
bars that you're supposed to like flip

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.000
