00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.010 
another walk walk in between the triples
I<00:01:40.789> know<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.060> sounds<00:01:41.300> really<00:01:41.390> confusing<00:01:41.989> right

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I know it sounds really confusing right

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.620 
I know it sounds really confusing right
now<00:01:42.319> but<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.830> give<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.069> an<00:01:43.190> idea<00:01:43.630> we're

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
now but just to give you an idea we're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.529 
now but just to give you an idea we're
gonna<00:01:44.720> do<00:01:44.989> a<00:01:45.020> walk<00:01:45.410> walk<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.580> they<00:01:46.789> triple<00:01:47.300> and

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
gonna do a walk walk and they triple and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.870 
gonna do a walk walk and they triple and
here<00:01:48.319> normally<00:01:48.830> when<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.069> would<00:01:49.489> do<00:01:49.580> another

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
here normally when we would do another

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.580 
here normally when we would do another
triple<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.420> in<00:01:50.479> our<00:01:50.630> six<00:01:50.929> count<00:01:51.170> pattern

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
triple and in our six count pattern

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.740 
triple and in our six count pattern
we're<00:01:51.800> actually<00:01:51.979> gonna<00:01:52.310> add<00:01:52.550> on<00:01:52.819> two<00:01:53.330> extra

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
we're actually gonna add on two extra

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.050 
we're actually gonna add on two extra
beats<00:01:53.989> therefore<00:01:54.619> we're<00:01:54.770> gonna<00:01:54.860> add<00:01:55.130> two<00:01:55.849> more

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
beats therefore we're gonna add two more

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.109 
beats therefore we're gonna add two more
walks<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:57.470> walk<00:01:57.819> walk<00:01:58.819> triple<00:01:59.599> step<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:02.030> we

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
walks and a walk walk triple step so we

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.880 
walks and a walk walk triple step so we
have<00:02:02.300> walk<00:02:02.869> walk<00:02:03.679> triple<00:02:04.429> step<00:02:04.910> walk<00:02:05.890> walk

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
have walk walk triple step walk walk

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.089 
have walk walk triple step walk walk
triple<00:02:07.550> step<00:02:07.970> one<00:02:08.899> more<00:02:09.020> time<00:02:09.200> that's<00:02:09.349> walk

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.679 
break down the footwork for you for the
whip<00:04:03.109> remember<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:03.919> keep<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.280> mind<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:05.000> whip

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
whip remember and keep in mind that whip

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.330 
whip remember and keep in mind that whip
is<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.109> account<00:04:06.290> pattern<00:04:06.739> therefore<00:04:07.189> we

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
is in the account pattern therefore we

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.759 
is in the account pattern therefore we
have<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.729> extend<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.329> by<00:04:08.509> two<00:04:08.569> extra<00:04:09.109> beats<00:04:09.409> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
have to extend it by two extra beats and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:10.959 
have to extend it by two extra beats and
that<00:04:09.859> means<00:04:10.040> we're<00:04:10.189> gonna<00:04:10.250> sneak<00:04:10.669> in<00:04:10.849> there

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:10.969 
that means we're gonna sneak in there

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.379 
that means we're gonna sneak in there
two<00:04:11.269> walks<00:04:11.989> or<00:04:12.290> two<00:04:12.409> extra<00:04:12.799> steps<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:14.180> we're

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
two walks or two extra steps so we're

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.849 
two walks or two extra steps so we're
gonna<00:04:14.479> start<00:04:14.900> it's<00:04:15.109> gonna<00:04:15.259> it's<00:04:15.590> gonna<00:04:15.650> be

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
gonna start it's gonna it's gonna be

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.770 
gonna start it's gonna it's gonna be
very<00:04:16.099> similar<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.549> right<00:04:16.909> side<00:04:17.150> pass<00:04:17.359> ladies

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
very similar to right side pass ladies

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.779 
very similar to right side pass ladies
so<00:04:18.709> we're<00:04:19.009> gonna<00:04:19.099> go<00:04:19.370> walk<00:04:20.289> pivot<00:04:21.289> walk<00:04:22.099> yes

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
so we're gonna go walk pivot walk yes

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.060 
so we're gonna go walk pivot walk yes
now<00:04:23.599> we're<00:04:23.750> gonna<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:24.080> back<00:04:24.110> with<00:04:24.650> her<00:04:24.800> right

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
now we're gonna go back with her right

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
every time you're four you've stepped

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.029 
every time you're four you've stepped
back<00:04:33.129> and<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:34.000> an<00:04:34.120> eight<00:04:34.300> count<00:04:34.479> pattern

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
back and on an eight count pattern

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.959 
back and on an eight count pattern
usually<00:04:36.039> in<00:04:36.159> most<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.550> time<00:04:36.729> you're<00:04:36.909> gonna

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
go forward on four so this is where he

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.309 
go forward on four so this is where he
brings<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> forward<00:04:40.569> he's<00:04:40.840> stepping<00:04:41.229> across

to walk walks yes and collect for an
anchor<00:04:50.289> step<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:51.550> one<00:04:51.729> more<00:04:51.909> time<00:04:52.020> walk<00:04:53.250> walk

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
anchor step so one more time walk walk

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:02.369 
anchor step so one more time walk walk
triple<00:04:55.419> step<00:04:56.669> walk<00:04:58.710> walk<00:04:59.710> triple<00:05:00.639> step<00:05:01.379> it's

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
triple step walk walk triple step it's

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.809 
triple step walk walk triple step it's
very<00:05:02.530> important<00:05:03.189> that<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.490> learn<00:05:03.610> these

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
very important that you learn these

basics and that way you don't get the

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.119 
basics and that way you don't get the
idea<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:07.300> what<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.689> lead<00:05:08.409> is<00:05:08.560> already<00:05:08.919> going

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
idea of what the lead is already going

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.429 
idea of what the lead is already going
to<00:05:09.279> do<00:05:09.669> because<00:05:10.349> once<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.590> get<00:05:12.330> here<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.569> then

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
to do because once you get here and then

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.249 
to do because once you get here and then
you<00:05:14.590> triple<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:16.150> very<00:05:16.449> essential<00:05:16.750> for<00:05:17.050> you

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
you triple it's very essential for you

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.920 
you triple it's very essential for you
to<00:05:17.289> know<00:05:17.889> -<00:05:17.949> not<00:05:18.490> just<00:05:18.759> step<00:05:19.060> forward<00:05:19.090> because

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
to know - not just step forward because

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.350 
to know - not just step forward because
what<00:05:20.590> if<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.889> is<00:05:21.039> a<00:05:21.219> right-side<00:05:21.759> pass<00:05:21.969> and<00:05:22.270> he

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
what if it is a right-side pass and he

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.839 
what if it is a right-side pass and he
wants<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.629> take<00:05:22.870> you<00:05:23.020> actually<00:05:23.409> back<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.580> don't
