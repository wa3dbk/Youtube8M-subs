what we'd like you to fix that is been

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.839 
what we'd like you to fix that is been
that<00:01:48.780> inside<00:01:49.080> arm<00:01:49.259> open<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.099> the<00:01:50.220> hips<00:01:50.429> get

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
that inside arm open up the hips get

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.790 
that inside arm open up the hips get
everything<00:01:51.090> open<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.599> there's<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.590> pressure

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
everything open up there's the pressure

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.350 
everything open up there's the pressure
down<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.160> there<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.819> is<00:01:53.940> back<00:01:54.119> more

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
down in there that is back more

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
down in there that is back more
horizontal<00:01:54.869> instead<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> vertical<00:01:55.200> twist

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
horizontal instead of vertical twist

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.919 
horizontal instead of vertical twist
again<00:01:55.709> but<00:01:56.009> twist<00:01:56.580> twist<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:57.599> lean<00:01:57.780> angle

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
again but twist twist more lean angle

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.820 
again but twist twist more lean angle
and<00:01:58.349> slower<00:01:59.039> fix<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.229> less<00:02:01.229> lean<00:02:01.470> angle<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and slower fix it less lean angle and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.180 
and slower fix it less lean angle and
faster<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.610> huh<00:02:03.179> how<00:02:03.690> gosh<00:02:04.530> darn<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.069> how<00:02:05.130> do

right<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.450> rider<00:02:47.720> accelerate<00:02:48.620> harder<00:02:48.980> this

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
right this rider accelerate harder this

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
so decked you can't accelerate and the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.710 
so decked you can't accelerate and the
tires<00:02:56.000> don't<00:02:56.270> last

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720
