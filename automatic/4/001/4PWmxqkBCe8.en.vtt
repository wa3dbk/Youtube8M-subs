okay<00:00:05.620> today<00:00:06.120> we're<00:00:07.120> learning<00:00:07.450> at<00:00:07.779> a<00:00:07.810> pinch

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
okay today we're learning at a pinch

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.949 
okay today we're learning at a pinch
harmonics<00:00:09.160> which<00:00:09.400> is<00:00:09.610> when<00:00:09.969> especially<00:00:10.809> she

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
harmonics which is when especially she

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.600 
harmonics which is when especially she
really<00:00:11.200> kind<00:00:11.469> of<00:00:11.530> like<00:00:11.889> faster<00:00:12.429> way<00:00:12.580> of

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
really kind of like faster way of

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
really kind of like faster way of
hitting<00:00:12.880> her<00:00:13.389> marks<00:00:13.780> I<00:00:15.180> just<00:00:16.180> learned<00:00:16.390> this

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
hitting her marks I just learned this

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.340 
hitting her marks I just learned this
just<00:00:16.930> a<00:00:17.050> few<00:00:17.590> days<00:00:17.740> ago<00:00:17.980> maybe<00:00:19.020> from<00:00:20.020> a<00:00:20.050> friend

be a few reasons that this video kind of

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.040 
be a few reasons that this video kind of
sounds<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.400> little<00:00:30.699> oftenly<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:31.869> little

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
sounds a little oftenly just a little

again remark I've got just distortion as

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.280 
again remark I've got just distortion as
much<00:00:45.640> as<00:00:45.790> I<00:00:45.879> can<00:00:46.059> possibly<00:00:46.150> get<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.750> my<00:00:46.900> am<00:00:47.019> here

much as I can possibly get on my am here
I've<00:00:47.860> got<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.129> set<00:00:48.369> to<00:00:48.489> leave<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.820> my<00:00:48.909> guitar<00:00:49.150> man

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
I've got a set to leave on my guitar man

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.660 
I've got a set to leave on my guitar man
tournament<00:00:50.199> our<00:00:50.470> way<00:00:50.769> up<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.309> will<00:00:51.460> sound

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
do is take the middle finger of your

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.940 
do is take the middle finger of your
left<00:01:10.570> hand<00:01:10.900> when<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.230> use<00:01:11.260> anyone<00:01:11.740> but

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
left hand when you can use anyone but

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.160 
left hand when you can use anyone but
the<00:01:12.250> middle<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.550> actually<00:01:12.850> easiest<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.900> go<00:01:14.050> up

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
the middle is actually easiest and go up

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.630 
the middle is actually easiest and go up
like<00:01:14.650> past<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.790> first<00:01:16.300> pick<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:17.020> or<00:01:17.430> near<00:01:18.430> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
like past the first pick up or near the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.480 
like past the first pick up or near the
pickup<00:01:18.910> on<00:01:19.060> your<00:01:19.180> guitar<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.580> when<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:21.880> pick

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
pickup on your guitar and when you pick

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.620 
pickup on your guitar and when you pick
just<00:01:22.790> do<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.000> natural<00:01:23.329> online<00:01:24.880> okay<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.479> a

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
just do the natural online okay that's a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.120 
just do the natural online okay that's a
nice<00:01:26.780> welcome<00:01:26.899> on<00:01:27.170> how<00:01:27.320> efficient<00:01:27.799> this<00:01:27.979> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
nice welcome on how efficient this is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.770 
nice welcome on how efficient this is
the<00:01:28.250> third<00:01:28.460> open<00:01:29.049> but<00:01:30.049> here's<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.290> harm<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:31.780> ok

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
the third open but here's the harm on ok

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.700 
the third open but here's the harm on ok
and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:34.180> why<00:01:35.180> what<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.509> do<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:36.289> after<00:01:36.500> you've

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
and then why what you do is after you've

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.950 
and then why what you do is after you've
got<00:01:36.860> mad<00:01:37.130> how<00:01:37.399> would<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.549> practice<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.390> with

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
got mad how would you practice it with

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.639 
got mad how would you practice it with
your<00:01:39.140> right<00:01:39.350> middle<00:01:40.159> finger<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:41.560> it'll<00:01:42.560> be

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
your right middle finger but it'll be

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.710 
your right middle finger but it'll be
called<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.009> tap<00:01:43.220> harmonic<00:01:43.729> settle<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.509> like

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
called a tap harmonic settle be like

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.020 
called a tap harmonic settle be like
this

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.940 

and<00:01:50.570> sometimes<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.170> you're<00:01:51.409> both<00:01:51.619> know<00:01:51.890> to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
and sometimes you you're both know to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.740 
and sometimes you you're both know to
remove<00:01:52.250> through<00:01:52.430> like<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.000> now<00:01:53.210> but

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
remove through like that just now but

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.350 
remove through like that just now but
you<00:01:53.869> listen<00:01:54.170> when<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.320> tap<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:55.100> goes<00:01:55.729> up<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
you listen when I tap it it goes up the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.130 
you listen when I tap it it goes up the
octave

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.240 

you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.919 

not<00:02:04.000> quite<00:02:04.360> as<00:02:04.510> clean<00:02:04.780> sounding<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.470> stuff

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.380 

okay<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:10.160> pinch<00:02:10.519> harmonic<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.180> when

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
okay and then a pinch harmonic is when

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.630 
okay and then a pinch harmonic is when
you<00:02:11.510> actually<00:02:11.569> use<00:02:12.050> your<00:02:12.230> thumb<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.340> pick

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you actually use your thumb but you pick

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520 
you actually use your thumb but you pick
it<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.120> pick<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.420> note<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.959> then<00:02:15.230> right

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it you pick the note and then right

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
it you pick the note and then right
after<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.890> picking<00:02:16.250> your<00:02:16.370> thumb<00:02:16.610> hits<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
after you picking your thumb hits it to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.490 
after you picking your thumb hits it to
make<00:02:17.239> darme<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:17.959> see<00:02:18.080> if<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.379> do

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
make darme on it and see if I can do

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.780 
make darme on it and see if I can do
this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:36.160 

yes

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:56.100 

ok<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.190> do<00:02:37.400> down<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:38.030> stretch

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.600 

okay<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.530> that's<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.740> basics<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.250> picture

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
okay so that's the basics of picture

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.120 
okay so that's the basics of picture
Mars<00:02:59.200> they're<00:03:00.200> using<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> lot<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.710> course

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
Mars they're using a lot of course

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.570 
Mars they're using a lot of course
cartoon<00:03:01.760> alike<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:03.800> course<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.160> can't<00:03:04.340> think<00:03:04.460> of

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
cartoon alike of course I can't think of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.010 
cartoon alike of course I can't think of
an<00:03:04.670> right<00:03:04.820> now<00:03:04.940> i<00:03:04.970> know<00:03:05.090> i'm<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.900> guitarist

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
an right now i know i'm the guitarist

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.420 
an right now i know i'm the guitarist
from<00:03:07.330> shadows<00:03:08.330> fall<00:03:08.570> using<00:03:09.170> what<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:10.250> yes

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
from shadows fall using what but yes

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.390 
from shadows fall using what but yes
let's<00:03:10.670> gone<00:03:10.820> for<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> close-up

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.220 

okay<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.460> pinch<00:03:16.880> harmonics<00:03:17.420> um<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:18.080> gonna

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
okay so pinch harmonics um I'm gonna

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.660 
okay so pinch harmonics um I'm gonna
have<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.380> video<00:03:18.650> posted<00:03:18.980> work<00:03:19.130> before<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.490> on

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
have a video posted work before this on

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.930 
have a video posted work before this on
just<00:03:19.850> natural<00:03:20.180> harmonics<00:03:20.740> um<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:22.610> yeah<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
just natural harmonics um so yeah so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.860 
just natural harmonics um so yeah so
you're<00:03:23.060> gonna<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.420> watch<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.570> first

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you're gonna have to watch that first

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.020 
you're gonna have to watch that first
because<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.320> natural<00:03:24.620> harmonic<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.160> just

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
because the natural harmonic is just

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.200 
because the natural harmonic is just
it's<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.950> total<00:03:27.950> idiot<00:03:28.490> or<00:03:28.790> less<00:03:28.940> than<00:03:29.060> myself

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
it's a total idiot or less than myself

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's a total idiot or less than myself
but<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> natural<00:03:30.140> harmonic<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.590> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
but this is a natural harmonic on the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:47.110 
but this is a natural harmonic on the
third<00:03:30.830> string<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.990> it'll<00:03:33.140> pan

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.759 

okay<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.480> those<00:03:48.689> were<00:03:48.900> all<00:03:49.049> natural

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
okay so that those were all natural

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.339 
okay so that those were all natural
harmonics<00:03:50.189> there<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.579> then<00:03:51.060> an<00:03:51.840> artificial

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
harmonics there and then an artificial

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.509 
harmonics there and then an artificial
harmonic<00:03:52.709> would<00:03:52.859> be<00:03:52.980> when<00:03:53.249> you<00:03:53.340> aren't

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
harmonic would be when you aren't

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.679 
harmonic would be when you aren't
playing<00:03:53.700> an<00:03:53.849> open<00:03:54.030> string<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.420> right<00:03:54.569> now

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
playing an open string like right now

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.640 
playing an open string like right now
I'm<00:03:54.780> holding<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.049> second<00:03:55.349> front<00:03:55.469> on<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
I'm holding the second front on the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.309 
I'm holding the second front on the
third<00:03:55.859> string<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.540> I'm<00:03:57.719> going<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.019> tap

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
third string and I'm going to do a tap

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.819 
third string and I'm going to do a tap
tap<00:03:59.010> or<00:03:59.159> money<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.989> right<00:04:04.260> there<00:04:04.290> is

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
tap or money and that right there is

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.349 
tap or money and that right there is
when<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.150> would<00:04:06.659> say<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.680> me<00:04:07.799> anyway

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
when I would say that for me anyway

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.640 
when I would say that for me anyway
pinch<00:04:09.359> harmonics<00:04:09.810> are<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.109> most<00:04:10.349> useful

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
pinch harmonics are the most useful

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.740 
pinch harmonics are the most useful
because<00:04:11.639> then<00:04:11.969> you<00:04:12.090> don't<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.599> that

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
because then you don't have to have that

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.179 
because then you don't have to have that
open<00:04:12.930> note<00:04:13.230> first<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.739> just<00:04:13.889> go<00:04:13.980> right

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
open note first you can just go right

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:23.969 
open note first you can just go right
into<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.459> harmonic

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.379 

you<00:04:24.979> know<00:04:25.130> okay<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.639> such<00:04:25.789> or<00:04:25.940> such<00:04:25.970> whatever

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
you know okay and such or such whatever

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.879 
you know okay and such or such whatever
alright<00:04:27.020> so<00:04:27.229> let's<00:04:27.470> have<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.620> look<00:04:27.650> at<00:04:27.770> this

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
alright so let's have a look at this

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.680 
alright so let's have a look at this
first<00:04:28.280> like<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.669> said<00:04:28.849> before<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.210> want<00:04:29.449> you<00:04:29.599> to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
first like I said before I want you to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.450 
first like I said before I want you to
find<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.139> good<00:04:30.620> natural<00:04:30.830> harmonic<00:04:31.280> for<00:04:31.400> you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
find a good natural harmonic for you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.730 
find a good natural harmonic for you
that's<00:04:31.639> up<00:04:31.880> here<00:04:32.180> most<00:04:33.169> people<00:04:33.349> play<00:04:33.500> them<00:04:33.680> on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
that's up here most people play them on

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.379 
that's up here most people play them on
the<00:04:33.830> twelfth<00:04:34.130> fret<00:04:34.250> or<00:04:34.520> just<00:04:34.819> wherever<00:04:35.000> like

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the twelfth fret or just wherever like

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.710 
the twelfth fret or just wherever like
actually<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.740> song<00:04:36.949> d<00:04:37.250> by<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:38.300> think

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
actually in in the song d by I think

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.600 
actually in in the song d by I think
Randy<00:04:38.840> Rhoads<00:04:39.110> plays<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.220> an<00:04:40.310> Aussie

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
Randy Rhoads plays it it's an Aussie

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.180 
Randy Rhoads plays it it's an Aussie
song<00:04:41.380> apparently<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.560> don't<00:04:42.770> know<00:04:42.830> why<00:04:42.979> it's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
song apparently I don't know why it's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.469 
song apparently I don't know why it's
labeled<00:04:43.490> like<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.789> there's<00:04:43.940> no<00:04:44.000> vocals<00:04:44.389> or

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
labeled like that there's no vocals or

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.270 
labeled like that there's no vocals or
anything<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:44.930> anyway<00:04:45.229> he<00:04:46.039> does

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
anything in it but anyway he does

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.860 
anything in it but anyway he does
harmonics<00:04:46.819> on<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> 7th<00:04:47.330> fret<00:04:47.419> which<00:04:47.720> is

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
harmonics on the 7th fret which is

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.439 
harmonics on the 7th fret which is
actually<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.530> little<00:04:48.919> bit<00:04:49.130> odd<00:04:49.699> to<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.300> about

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
actually a little bit odd to do about

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.350 
actually a little bit odd to do about
anyway<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:52.220> find<00:04:52.550> yourself<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:52.970> nice<00:04:53.120> natural

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
anyway so find yourself a nice natural

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.010 
anyway so find yourself a nice natural
harmonic<00:04:53.930> that's<00:04:54.110> up<00:04:54.289> here<00:04:54.819> by<00:04:55.819> your<00:04:56.090> pickups

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
harmonic that's up here by your pickups

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.110 
harmonic that's up here by your pickups
between<00:04:57.380> them<00:04:57.800> next<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.060> you

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
between them next to the one that you

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
try that tap picking you're just gonna

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.909 
try that tap picking you're just gonna
you<00:05:11.840> know<00:05:11.930> you're<00:05:12.080> not<00:05:12.199> going<00:05:12.319> to<00:05:12.380> be<00:05:12.470> using

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
you know you're not going to be using

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.830 
you know you're not going to be using
your<00:05:13.099> left<00:05:13.250> hand<00:05:13.370> for<00:05:13.639> this

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
match the natural that you were doing so

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.950 
match the natural that you were doing so
try<00:05:25.070> and<00:05:25.160> get<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.490> same<00:05:25.760> place<00:05:25.960> then

try and get it in the same place then

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.190

now<00:05:27.800> we're<00:05:28.040> going<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.280> jump<00:05:28.639> right<00:05:28.760> into<00:05:28.940> the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
now we're going to jump right into the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.070 
now we're going to jump right into the
pinch<00:05:30.200> harmonics<00:05:30.680> here<00:05:31.660> what<00:05:32.660> you<00:05:32.780> going<00:05:33.020> to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
pinch harmonics here what you going to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.620 
pinch harmonics here what you going to
do<00:05:33.230> if<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:33.860> look<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.280> can<00:05:34.400> see<00:05:34.510> here's<00:05:35.510> my

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
do if you look you can see here's my

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.200 
do if you look you can see here's my
thumb<00:05:36.139> here<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:36.980> here's<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.820> pic<00:05:38.030> it's

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
thumb here and here's the pic it's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.750 
thumb here and here's the pic it's
barely<00:05:38.630> even<00:05:38.810> over<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.500> actually<00:05:40.160> my<00:05:40.280> thumb<00:05:40.520> is

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
barely even over it actually my thumb is

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.680 
barely even over it actually my thumb is
out<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:40.940> little<00:05:41.090> bit<00:05:41.210> further<00:05:41.360> than<00:05:41.480> that

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
out a little bit further than that

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.920 
out a little bit further than that
because<00:05:42.400> when<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.430> hit<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.540> goes<00:05:44.720> off

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
because when I hit it that it goes off

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.570 
because when I hit it that it goes off
the<00:05:45.139> pic<00:05:45.320> makes<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:45.740> note<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.040> then<00:05:46.190> my<00:05:46.370> fell

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
the pic makes a note and then my fell

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.629 
the pic makes a note and then my fell
immediately<00:05:46.850> catches<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:47.540> so

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.640 

see<00:05:54.360> that<00:05:54.960> was<00:05:55.080> it

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
see that was it

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.740 
see that was it
check<00:05:56.800> out

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.170 

okay<00:06:02.350> and<00:06:02.620> as<00:06:03.100> you<00:06:03.310> just<00:06:03.550> saw<00:06:03.670> you<00:06:03.730> can<00:06:04.030> also

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
okay and as you just saw you can also

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.180 
okay and as you just saw you can also
pick<00:06:04.480> normal<00:06:04.780> with<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.290> that<00:06:05.980> right

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
pick normal with that and that right

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:15.270 
pick normal with that and that right
there<00:06:06.400> would<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.580> pinched<00:06:06.880> are<00:06:07.030> mine

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280
