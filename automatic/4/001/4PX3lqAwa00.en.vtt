feature<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.980> these<00:02:32.100> tractors<00:02:32.550> too<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
feature on these tractors too is the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900 
feature on these tractors too is the
obvious<00:02:33.600> maintenance<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.560> ease<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.220> by

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
obvious maintenance and ease of it by

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.060 
obvious maintenance and ease of it by
simply<00:02:36.270> just<00:02:36.510> pulling<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> radiators

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
simply just pulling out the radiators

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.590 
simply just pulling out the radiators
you<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> air<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:38.880> behind<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:39.570> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you can get the air in behind there and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.060 
you can get the air in behind there and
just<00:02:39.810> blown<00:02:40.020> right<00:02:40.230> out<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.560> clean<00:02:40.800> them<00:02:40.950> out

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

but<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> said<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.840> easy<00:02:42.990> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
but as I said it's just really easy to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:52.130 
but as I said it's just really easy to
access<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.950 

right<00:02:53.140> I'm<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:55.390> first<00:02:55.630> thing<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.900> know

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
right I'm in and the first thing I know

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.960 
right I'm in and the first thing I know
this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.800> incredible<00:02:57.340> vision<00:02:57.730> all

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
this is just the incredible vision all

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.960 
this is just the incredible vision all
around<00:02:58.510> everything<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.610> mounted<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.940> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
around everything is mounted on the
