kind of expand on this a little bit so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
kind of expand on this a little bit so
basically<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> whole<00:00:50.610> concept<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> releasing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the base variant of the weapon but at

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
the base variant of the weapon but at
the<00:01:30.960> same<00:01:31.170> time<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.740> enjoy<00:01:32.070> getting<00:01:32.340> to

because it's different unlike anything
we've<00:01:36.479> ever<00:01:36.540> seen<00:01:36.689> before<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
we've ever seen before so I think that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
we've ever seen before so I think that
would<00:01:37.829> definitely<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.700> awesome<00:01:39.150> DLC<00:01:39.600> by

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
would definitely be an awesome DLC by

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
would definitely be an awesome DLC by
advanced<00:01:40.680> warfare<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.159> by<00:01:41.250> sledgehammer<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
advanced warfare and by sledgehammer I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.920 
advanced warfare and by sledgehammer I
don't<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.240> it'll<00:01:42.360> happen<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.899> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
don't think it'll happen but you can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.210 
don't think it'll happen but you can
only<00:01:43.110> speculate<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> always<00:01:44.070> throw

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
only speculate you can always throw

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
only speculate you can always throw
ideas<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.600> people<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> try<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
ideas out there for people to try to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
ideas out there for people to try to
take<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.680> critique<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.369> I'll<00:01:47.820> let<00:01:47.970> me<00:01:48.030> know

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
take and critique so I'll let me know

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
take and critique so I'll let me know
what<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> guys<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.750> maybe<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.619> could<00:01:49.770> have

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
what you guys think maybe you could have

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
what you guys think maybe you could have
two<00:01:50.250> super<00:01:50.850> elite<00:01:51.180> weapons<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.720> every<00:01:52.110> single

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
two super elite weapons for every single

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
two super elite weapons for every single
gun<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> game<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.000> chances<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
gun in the game and the chances of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.899 
gun in the game and the chances of
actually<00:01:54.659> getting<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
actually getting one of these is

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
actually getting one of these is
astronomically<00:01:56.909> low<00:01:57.090> maybe<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
astronomically low maybe you get one in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.350 
astronomically low maybe you get one in
your<00:01:58.469> entire<00:01:58.770> career<00:01:59.159> until<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> nice

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
your entire career until the nice

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450 
your entire career until the nice
ecology<00:02:00.810> comes<00:02:00.990> out<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:02.040> that'd<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
ecology comes out so I think that'd be a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
ecology comes out so I think that'd be a
good<00:02:02.610> idea<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.840> made<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
good idea I really think if they made it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.289 
good idea I really think if they made it
super<00:02:04.290> rare<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.219> made<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.060> not

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
super rare if they made it you know not

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
super rare if they made it you know not
super<00:02:06.840> overpowered<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.409> definitely<00:02:07.979> worth

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
super overpowered but definitely worth

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
super overpowered but definitely worth
getting<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.759> know<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.060> definitely

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
getting you know it's definitely

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.330 
getting you know it's definitely
noticeable<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.200> super<00:02:10.649> super

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
noticeable that it's super super

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.979 
noticeable that it's super super
prestigious<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.209> makes<00:02:12.390> sense<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.690> maybe

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
prestigious if that makes sense so maybe

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
prestigious if that makes sense so maybe
the<00:02:13.140> bow<00:02:13.319> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the bow of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
the bow of
city<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.100> seed<00:02:14.370> could<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.120> an<00:02:15.210> upgrade

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
city and seed could have an upgrade

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.900 
city and seed could have an upgrade
being<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> bowel<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:16.830> golden<00:02:17.460> seed<00:02:17.730> or

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
being the bowel you know golden seed or

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
being the bowel you know golden seed or
I<00:02:17.940> don't<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.390> that's<00:02:18.600> actually<00:02:18.750> downgrade

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
I don't know that's actually downgrade

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.900 
I don't know that's actually downgrade
but<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.220> what<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> mean<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.760> there's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
but you know what I mean like if there's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.160 
but you know what I mean like if there's
a<00:02:20.970> different<00:02:21.270> name<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.840> has<00:02:21.960> maybe

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
a different name for and it has maybe

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.740 
a different name for and it has maybe
plus<00:02:22.560> four<00:02:22.950> or<00:02:22.980> plus<00:02:23.430> three<00:02:23.760> damage<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.630> then

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
plus four or plus three damage but then

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.660 
plus four or plus three damage but then
a<00:02:24.780> lot<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.200> negatives<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:25.920> well<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.220> -<00:02:26.520> for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
a lot of negatives as well like - for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.700 
a lot of negatives as well like - for
accuracy<00:02:27.240> or<00:02:27.360> something<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.470> then<00:02:28.590> again

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
accuracy or something but then again

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.080 
accuracy or something but then again
that<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.100> become<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.430> little<00:02:29.700> bit<00:02:29.850> over

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that could become a little bit over

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.520 
that could become a little bit over
power<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.510> I'm<00:02:30.570> sure<00:02:30.810> many<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.230> guys<00:02:31.290> may

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
power and I'm sure many of you guys may

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.260 
power and I'm sure many of you guys may
complain<00:02:31.860> that's<00:02:32.340> gonna<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.640> overpowered<00:02:33.150> but

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
complain that's gonna be overpowered but

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.160 
complain that's gonna be overpowered but
I'm<00:02:33.360> sure<00:02:33.510> there'd<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.780> some<00:02:33.960> kind<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
I'm sure there'd be some kind of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.840 
I'm sure there'd be some kind of
workaround<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.860> where<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.400> could<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.610> super

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
workaround to it where it could be super

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.030 
workaround to it where it could be super
rare<00:02:36.120> some<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.140> penalties<00:02:37.320> would<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.740> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
rare some of the penalties would be you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.980 
rare some of the penalties would be you
know<00:02:38.160> maybe<00:02:38.550> considerable<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.840> maybe

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
know maybe considerable you know maybe

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.180 
know maybe considerable you know maybe
you<00:02:40.140> wouldn't<00:02:40.320> want<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.530> use<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.800> because<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
you wouldn't want to use it because the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
you wouldn't want to use it because the
penalties<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.270> maybe<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.900> could<00:02:43.080> come<00:02:43.260> up

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
penalties but maybe they could come up

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.660 
penalties but maybe they could come up
with<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.680> kind<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.950> system<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.280> would<00:02:44.490> make

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
with some kind of system that would make

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.490 
with some kind of system that would make
it<00:02:44.820> work<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.180> I'm<00:02:45.240> sure<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.990> guys<00:02:46.170> over<00:02:46.410> at

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it work and I'm sure the guys over at

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
it work and I'm sure the guys over at
sledgehammer<00:02:46.920> would<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.280> able<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.880> so
