use people in radio contact so when when
the<00:04:57.139> AI<00:04:57.229> spot<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.039> as<00:04:58.159> a<00:04:58.189> forward<00:04:58.550> like<00:04:59.150> a

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
the AI spot you as a forward like a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.579 
the AI spot you as a forward like a
forward<00:04:59.509> observer<00:04:59.569> they<00:04:59.960> can<00:05:00.139> radio<00:05:00.439> their

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:00.589 
forward observer they can radio their

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:02.409 
forward observer they can radio their
guys<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.039> so<00:05:01.189> pretty<00:05:01.580> soon<00:05:01.849> you<00:05:02.029> might<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.389> a

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
guys and so pretty soon you might have a

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.399 
guys and so pretty soon you might have a
large<00:05:02.870> force<00:05:03.139> bearing<00:05:03.439> down<00:05:03.560> on<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:05.409> they've

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
large force bearing down on you they've

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.689 
large force bearing down on you they've
got<00:05:06.560> choppers<00:05:06.770> in<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.009> air<00:05:07.099> on<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.520> mission

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
got choppers in the air on this mission

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.909 
got choppers in the air on this mission
so<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.240> think<00:05:08.539> zebra<00:05:08.960> they<00:05:09.379> might<00:05:09.529> be<00:05:09.650> engaging

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
so I think zebra they might be engaging

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.640 
so I think zebra they might be engaging
the<00:05:10.129> other<00:05:12.310> oh<00:05:13.659> they'll<00:05:14.659> be<00:05:14.779> giving<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.259> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
the other oh they'll be giving the the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.260 
the other oh they'll be giving the the
other<00:05:15.889> guys<00:05:16.039> on<00:05:16.189> the<00:05:16.279> ground<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.759> positions

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
other guys on the ground the positions

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.149 
other guys on the ground the positions
of<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:17.599> your<00:05:18.139> guy<00:05:18.319> see<00:05:18.529> we've<00:05:18.710> got<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.919> keep<00:05:19.009> on

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
terrain to take cover and use gullies

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.459 
terrain to take cover and use gullies
and<00:05:22.520> step<00:05:22.849> to<00:05:22.969> advance<00:05:23.349> unfortunately<00:05:24.349> you

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
I was trying to get to as we don't have

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.029 
I was trying to get to as we don't have
a<00:05:28.699> huge<00:05:29.120> amount<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.509> time<00:05:29.749> I<00:05:29.779> was<00:05:30.199> playing<00:05:30.949> the

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
a huge amount of time I was playing the

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.649 
a huge amount of time I was playing the
mission<00:05:31.339> probably<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.699> little<00:05:31.819> more<00:05:32.149> quickly

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
mission probably a little more quickly

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.529 
mission probably a little more quickly
in<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.080> bit<00:05:33.229> more<00:05:33.379> again<00:05:33.740> Rambo<00:05:34.249> than<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:35.360> game

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
in a bit more again Rambo than the game

is supposed to be again this game is all
about<00:05:37.520> authenticity<00:05:38.029> and<00:05:38.830> unlike<00:05:39.830> the

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
about authenticity and unlike the

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.579 
about authenticity and unlike the
Hollywood<00:05:40.460> movies<00:05:40.909> that<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.360> see<00:05:41.599> missions

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
Hollywood movies that you see missions

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.459 
Hollywood movies that you see missions
do<00:05:42.860> take<00:05:43.189> some<00:05:43.490> time<00:05:44.389> you<00:05:44.719> know<00:05:44.839> a<00:05:45.229> certain

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
do take some time you know a certain

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.980 
do take some time you know a certain
amount<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.860> planning<00:05:46.129> is<00:05:46.399> required<00:05:46.990> another

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
amount of planning is required another

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.600 
amount of planning is required another
thing<00:05:48.199> you'll<00:05:48.319> notice<00:05:48.499> is<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:49.099> have<00:05:49.580> a

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
thing you'll notice is I have a

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.969 
thing you'll notice is I have a
checkpoint<00:05:50.389> but<00:05:50.659> as<00:05:50.810> it's<00:05:50.990> hardcore<00:05:51.289> it's<00:05:51.860> all

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
checkpoint but as it's hardcore it's all

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.249 
checkpoint but as it's hardcore it's all
the<00:05:52.069> way<00:05:52.099> back<00:05:52.310> at<00:05:52.459> the<00:05:52.550> start<00:05:52.879> I<00:05:53.120> won't<00:05:53.749> play

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
the way back at the start I won't play

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.809 
the way back at the start I won't play
through<00:05:54.469> the<00:05:54.560> whole<00:05:54.589> mission<00:05:54.919> again<00:05:55.249> will

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
through the whole mission again will

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.489 
through the whole mission again will
hand<00:05:56.120> over<00:05:56.240> to<00:05:56.599> rich<00:05:57.439> in<00:05:57.620> just<00:05:57.800> a<00:05:57.889> second<00:05:58.279> but

00:05:59.489 --> 00:05:59.499 
hand over to rich in just a second but

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:02.920 
hand over to rich in just a second but
so<00:06:00.499> one<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.009> the<00:06:01.189> major<00:06:01.999> things<00:06:02.330> about<00:06:02.689> the

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
so one of the major things about the

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.639 
so one of the major things about the
game<00:06:03.080> is<00:06:03.319> as<00:06:04.039> I<00:06:04.189> mentioned<00:06:04.629> hardcore<00:06:05.629> has<00:06:05.899> no

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:06.649 
game is as I mentioned hardcore has no

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.230 
game is as I mentioned hardcore has no
checkpoints<00:06:07.219> other<00:06:07.399> than<00:06:07.550> one<00:06:07.789> after<00:06:08.149> the

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
checkpoints other than one after the

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.399 
checkpoints other than one after the
very<00:06:08.389> start<00:06:09.159> whereas<00:06:10.159> the<00:06:10.399> other<00:06:10.550> game<00:06:11.409> our

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
very start whereas the other game our

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.199 
very start whereas the other game our
difficulty<00:06:13.189> modes<00:06:13.399> have<00:06:13.939> various<00:06:14.389> different

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.209 
difficulty modes have various different

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.619 
difficulty modes have various different
checkpoints<00:06:17.209> to<00:06:18.490> allow<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.939> continue<00:06:20.389> the

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
checkpoints to allow you to continue the

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:21.760 
checkpoints to allow you to continue the
action<00:06:20.959> which<00:06:21.110> is<00:06:21.259> something<00:06:21.469> that<00:06:21.649> the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
action which is something that the

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.499 
action which is something that the
original<00:06:21.949> flashpoint<00:06:22.639> didn't<00:06:22.969> do<00:06:23.209> and

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
original flashpoint didn't do and

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.920 
original flashpoint didn't do and
something<00:06:24.229> we<00:06:24.439> we<00:06:25.189> decided<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.759> put<00:06:25.909> in<00:06:26.060> to

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
something we we decided to put in to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.480 
something we we decided to put in to
make<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.169> game<00:06:27.319> far<00:06:27.649> more<00:06:27.800> accessible<00:06:28.459> than

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
make the game far more accessible than

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.760 
make the game far more accessible than
the<00:06:28.729> original<00:06:29.060> flash<00:06:29.270> point<00:06:29.509> so<00:06:30.289> I<00:06:30.560> hope

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
the original flash point so I hope

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.420 
the original flash point so I hope
