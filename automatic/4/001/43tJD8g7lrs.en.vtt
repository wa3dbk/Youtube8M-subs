00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello welcome to tricks for 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.920
 beginners of animal crossing in the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 previous video I made 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 good to explain how they crossed 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.230
 flowers but I had some comments that I 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 they did not have problems and that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.560
 they did not know how to do it then in this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.779
 video we have dreamed how it was done 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.360
 Today I'm going to show you the steps to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.170
 have the hybrid flowers 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 find a broad place and low singer 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.880
 we have to remove all the weeds 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.580
 let there be first around 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.270
 and now let's go to the tom shop 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.830
 crazy and let's go for a walk around our 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:03.910
 town and we are going to plant two plants of 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.460
 same of the same species and we're going to 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.360
 plant 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 one beside the other 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 touching like this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:23.540
 it can be vertical horizontal and even 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:27.980
 diagonal to you have to make sure that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.810
 all around is free because it is 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:37.040
 over there where the hybrid plant will grow 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.700
 hybrid and now you're going to water it and every 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.520
 day will continue watering the two 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:48.610
 then out about five or six 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.610
 days depends on why a flower will come out 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 hybrid 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.220
 in this case I put a red cosmos with 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.380
 a yellow cosmos 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.380
 an orange cosmos comes out 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.610
 in this case 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.959
 could come out right here a cosmos of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.959
 pink colour 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.120
 here I could perfectly leave here 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.810
 You can go out by any of these 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 of these plots we could say in 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.709
 this case could have come out in many 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 more in this one in this one in this one 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:43.629
 list in this in this honest in this in 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.659
 this one and in this one and in the one that has come out 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.349
 will always come out in one that is touching 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:53.370
 with one of the flowers at least and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.370
 it can be diagonal 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 the color patterns is to say by 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.860
 red example with yellow on to the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.230
 lower the white with the red rose all 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.790
 you can get those patterns 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.350
 perfectly in the wikipedia or in some 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.600
 blog of someone who hangs 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:25.650
 tricks and you are looking at google patterns 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.319
 flowers and leaders that come out for 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.000
 and good for when we leave what 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.790
 we can do is keep it in our 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.069
 wardrobe so it does not rot and remove it 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.670
 and plant the other place to come out 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.080
 another flower and life 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 in the previous video I want to teach the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.190
 final I'll leave the link then if 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.180
 you want to see it but 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:59.370
 as I already showed you in a few flowers 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.190
 and it hurts 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.470
 but that had comments from people who 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.910
 do not 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:12.520
 I did not know how it was done and everything 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.400
 Well, here's the lady, look, there's 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:21.630
 black tulips saw the violets 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.380
 I saw the oranges pink black cosmos 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.009
 orange tulips are roses and many 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.009
 others more 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.529
 with the orange viola there are many other 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:40.139
 more you can get it via internet 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.079
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.839
 video that you go through a channel there 

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:49.339
 a playlist with a lot 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.339
 of videos of something like that 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:58.110
 Well, see you in the next video
