00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
 Doug and welcome to a new we-feeling yes and today wanted 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.279
 I'll show you in a short tutorial how he thinks Prof 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.590
 Everyone gets to know me, my dad, because I thought again briefly 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.139
 previously gets her videos 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.200
 years 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.300
 Jetix Index on the page here Medea Plot Felix anyone online video 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.270
 describe it then he was 40 seconds thanks for the stone 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.849
 Ad Traun and select 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.829
 it is a profit driver Trier so he needed 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.690
 of course to unpack the room 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.090
 The Ticino open now adorns my Latin that's how it looks in the chaos 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.740
 would have to wrap up then 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.270
 I have ever done that and when rare 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.600
 call so 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.380
 in this folder is at the Main up here to lean back when 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.690
 Microsoft just came to heat up Roth DAX for a fake Metaxa 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.990
 so if you ever crash it more often of course now has to do it again 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 it only took a moment to be packed 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 just make up to the percentage are 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.430
 so now my strength is fulfilled 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 this the program 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170
 it would still meet 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.430
 there will be moment, too 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.250
 such a chip here means Count TU Darmstadt 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.490
 so the kicker Florian would normally be standing here right across line 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.610
 so 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 would not stand 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.100
 So as I said the cancellation on arise when this version 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.710
 a little older 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 Similarly, at the beginning who state is so if it beat first 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.130
 is that you have me then you have to make something else fire 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.950
 that shows just what the start menu must go here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 I am now here on Windows 7 and Windows XP and Vista is different there 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.450
 and then he comes on 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.660
 and then do it too 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.020
 So she opens a small Penz window 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.370
 yes and in that window you give one percent off there 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.730
 percent 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.730
 she gives that in and puts her on the clover 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.219
 so opens up here 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.420
 again a new window with all the documents on the computer 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.269
 are stored 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.569
 yes and there she is now looking for the Main power place my money is now 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.799
 up here 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.799
 annoyed with her now 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.719
 at the first start he is actually no documents in it because I that it is me 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.959
 have done 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.459
 are now here live commented race 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.569
 to tell Dr as he knows if he is afraid I will not again give advice to Erwin 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.269
 explain the third division on these words 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.739
 underneath you will find this trend sport 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.219
 These three folders know their copying 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.279
 in honor of this percent 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.629
 how to introduce into this partner 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.560
 yes and that's it already when you've inserted these documents then 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.659
 you can be sure thanks to the winners close 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.659
 and you can play the game normally 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.069
 As I said, old ones only commit to open mode 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.669
 More I hope you liked the dress gate in danger percent if you have any questions 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:11.489
 have 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.629
 you would like to write below in the comments 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.029
 8 would not notice that he was watching 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.369
 I would be happy Hanau and professionals
