lights saving these small block engines

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.940 
lights saving these small block engines
are<00:00:41.460> well-known<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.210> run<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> lobe<00:00:43.470> off<00:00:43.770> the

are well-known to run a lobe off the
camshaft<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.820> means<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.420> still<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.899> lobe

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
camshaft which means that still the lobe

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
camshaft which means that still the lobe
being<00:00:46.440> egg<00:00:47.010> shape<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:47.940> goes<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.510> then

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
being egg shape like it goes up and then

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
being egg shape like it goes up and then
comes<00:00:48.660> down<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> wears<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.790> down<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
comes down and wears it down as this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.950 
comes down and wears it down as this
round<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.610> that<00:00:53.610> ain't<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.030> won't<00:00:54.570> ever<00:00:54.719> run
