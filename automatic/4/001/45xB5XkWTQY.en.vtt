chargers<00:04:43.260> they<00:04:43.710> work<00:04:43.920> for<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.280> but

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
chargers they work for it but

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.670 
chargers they work for it but
blackberries<00:04:45.540> have<00:04:45.570> different<00:04:46.290> kind<00:04:46.500> of

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
blackberries have different kind of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.550 
blackberries have different kind of
batteries<00:04:47.520> they<00:04:47.730> have<00:04:47.850> lower<00:04:48.410> range<00:04:49.410> of

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
batteries they have lower range of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.730 
batteries they have lower range of
batteries<00:04:49.980> like<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:51.090> think<00:04:51.570> 1200<00:04:52.320> milliamp

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
batteries like I think 1200 milliamp

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.220 
batteries like I think 1200 milliamp
power<00:04:53.190> batteries<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.660> tried<00:04:54.900> using<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
power batteries so I tried using the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.590 
power batteries so I tried using the
charges<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.950> it<00:04:56.370> took<00:04:56.850> like<00:04:57.060> forever<00:04:57.330> to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
charges and it took like forever to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.930 
charges and it took like forever to
charge<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.530> killed<00:04:58.830> my<00:04:58.980> battery<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.700> make

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
charge and it killed my battery so make

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.580 
charge and it killed my battery so make
sure<00:04:59.970> you're<00:05:00.330> using<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.720> right<00:05:00.810> charger<00:05:01.410> or

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
sure you're using the right charger or

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.070 
sure you're using the right charger or
else<00:05:02.310> range<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.730> going<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.240> making<00:05:03.870> things

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
else range is going to be making things

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.960
