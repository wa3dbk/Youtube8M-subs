00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 hi friends this time we are going to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.640
 make a video of how we prepared 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.830
 the ground 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.090
 the steps that we have taken to plant 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.430
 a fruit rice 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 we'll see 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.720
 as the processes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.360
 we are going to take advantage of this month of January that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 is when we have a little more for the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.079
 area of the garden and we can focus 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.989
 a little in the fruit trees 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.500
 we mark with a rod the area where 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.630
 the tree will go and with a hoe we start 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.850
 take out also grass 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.310
 more or less than about 50 centimeters of 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 diameter 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.280
 with the shovel we are taking the tapping 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.130
 Sometimes he resists and we need to take 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 little help hand 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.790
 with the palote and with a shovel we started 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.920
 make the hole more or less than 50 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 centimeters deep 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 and depending on how hard we have the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 land we can ask someone to us 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 He lent a hand as in this case 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.110
 we cheated on my brother-in-law and the truth that his 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.110
 help came to us great 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.829
 do not 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.210
 today we are going to plant 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.799
 an apple tree 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 to my three as we did the handcuffs the 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.190
 another day 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.620
 the process 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.360
 but to plant an apple tree 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.770
 before 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.860
 start doing nothing what we have to 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.380
 to do is take the tree out of the bag that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.140
 comes to us 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 Now you have to leave it 15 minutes in water 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.100
 there is no habit when the nose 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.100
 always the first thing is to ride 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.069
 we can go doing something in the hole 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.569
 we have noticed that we did 50 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.879
 centimeters of the consumer 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.060
 and we have realized that the tree 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.430
 Of course, it does not have that depth 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 if it's true that we're going to leave about 10 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.180
 centimeters without covering of earth for 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.660
 that when it rains the water is here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.040
 stagnant and do not run 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 but the rest 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.099
 it will not get to that depth 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.980
 so let's cover it with a little bit of 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.799
 earth as loose earth and a mixture 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.560
 of peat and humus so you have something 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.300
 of credit 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.020
 the roots look strong 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.020
 we 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.690
 what we do is take out the fruit 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.600
 and let's put it in the hole 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.830
 let's see if we have calculated 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.830
 good to cover 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.579
 the space and the background 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 the mesh is the lack we appreciate 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.319
 because it is biodegradable 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.319
 the tree grows, it will go away 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.050
 good gradients 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.050
 as we see the pattern is here 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.580
 then everything that can not be left 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.720
 Clear 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.910
 because symbolizing would take root 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.030
 could take king and the pattern would not serve 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.030
 nothing 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.370
 earth again 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.020
 and since when 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.020
 a little bit of turn there's a bit of 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.250
 little bit 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.250
 how 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.430
 we see that it is still here 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 Pattern 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.840
 we will be a little bit more on land 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.690
 putting more should we can finish 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.420
 and now 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.680
 when the water with which we had 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.680
 been playing the ball 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.300
 it does not look 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.820
 before putting the stake 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.720
 we have to see where it shoots at 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.340
 tree 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.169
 is thought mind 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.160
 and position for the wind so that 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.160
 they do not have it in europe 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.780
 in this case 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.800
 so as not to disturb the three streets 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.800
 I will not put here 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.229
 we finish it 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.200
 like the tape 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.540
 the pressure tape at the same 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.600
 that does not abrade the tree but good 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.930
 that hold the rope like it would leave a mark 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.930
 and that 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.700
 we mark a little 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.000
 treat it a bit like that and the approach 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.639
 we cut it 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.639
 and the staple 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.080
 without having much either 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.650
 simply to go placing the piques 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.940
 Right 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.940
 to study Ã³scar 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.460
 now we go to another extreme 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.800
 to the time of listening around 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.370
 we try not to touch the trunk 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.300
 Well, with this, the 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.349
 Apple tree 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.349
 until the next video
