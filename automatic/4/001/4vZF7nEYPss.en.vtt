reddish<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.109> guess<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.769> would<00:04:19.919> say<00:04:19.949> in<00:04:20.370> color<00:04:20.639> but

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
reddish I guess I would say in color but

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.380 
reddish I guess I would say in color but
it<00:04:21.630> gives<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.169> really<00:04:22.469> great<00:04:23.390> shading

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
it gives you really great shading

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390 
it gives you really great shading
results<00:04:25.020> when<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.620> start<00:04:25.919> with<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.099> lighter

this<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.300> think<00:04:27.620> I'm<00:04:28.620> gonna<00:04:28.770> add<00:04:28.950> just<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.310> little
