productions<00:00:19.200> today<00:00:20.200> I<00:00:20.560> just<00:00:20.890> wanted<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.760> show

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
productions today I just wanted to show

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200 
productions today I just wanted to show
you<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:23.320> basic<00:00:23.860> artwork<00:00:24.340> creation<00:00:25.000> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
you some basic artwork creation and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.470 
you some basic artwork creation and
reinforce<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:26.640> method<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.849> working<00:00:28.360> in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
reinforce the method of working in

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.690 
reinforce the method of working in
layers<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.410> really<00:00:29.710> will<00:00:30.189> only<00:00:30.340> work

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
layers and this really will only work

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.060 
layers and this really will only work
when<00:00:30.939> you're<00:00:31.149> doing<00:00:31.630> very<00:00:31.809> simple<00:00:32.230> spot

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
when you're doing very simple spot

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.209 
when you're doing very simple spot
colors<00:00:33.489> where<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:35.020> cover<00:00:35.260> colors<00:00:35.829> do<00:00:36.190> not

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
colors where the cover colors do not

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.060 
colors where the cover colors do not
overlap<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.329> do<00:00:37.480> not<00:00:37.600> have<00:00:37.840> any

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
overlap and you do not have any

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.190 
overlap and you do not have any
gradients<00:00:39.070> or<00:00:39.190> halftone<00:00:39.670> type<00:00:40.180> stuff<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:40.510> this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
gradients or halftone type stuff so this

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.440 
gradients or halftone type stuff so this
is<00:00:41.410> for<00:00:41.649> year<00:00:41.860> when<00:00:42.370> you're<00:00:42.520> first<00:00:42.940> starting

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
is for year when you're first starting

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.510 
is for year when you're first starting
out<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.780> you're<00:00:44.140> creating<00:00:44.649> very<00:00:44.890> basic

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
out and you're creating very basic

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.419 
out and you're creating very basic
artwork<00:00:46.030> okay<00:00:46.929> and<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:47.829> could<00:00:48.070> be<00:00:48.219> using

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
artwork okay and you could be using

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.880 
artwork okay and you could be using
clipart<00:00:49.059> in<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.420> middle<00:00:49.719> or<00:00:50.050> anything<00:00:50.559> like

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
clipart in the middle or anything like

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.739 
clipart in the middle or anything like
that<00:00:50.920> as<00:00:51.370> possible<00:00:51.940> today<00:00:52.149> I'm<00:00:52.390> just<00:00:52.629> gonna

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
that as possible today I'm just gonna

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.200 
that as possible today I'm just gonna
work<00:00:52.989> with<00:00:53.320> shapes<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.190> fonts<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.760> show<00:00:54.969> a

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
work with shapes and fonts to show a

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.009 
work with shapes and fonts to show a
basic<00:00:55.690> idea<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:57.210> deal<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.449> is<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.839> first

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
basic idea and deal is is the first

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.169 
basic idea and deal is is the first
layer<00:00:59.379> that<00:00:59.620> you<00:00:59.769> create<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.190> work<00:01:00.519> on<00:01:00.760> should

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
layer that you create to work on should

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.950 
layer that you create to work on should
be<00:01:01.329> in<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.539> back<00:01:01.749> and<00:01:02.050> as<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.350> layer<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
be in the back and as you layer the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.200 
be in the back and as you layer the
subsequent<00:01:04.960> layers<00:01:05.170> will<00:01:05.440> be<00:01:05.470> on<00:01:05.860> top<00:01:06.490> now

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
subsequent layers will be on top now

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.550 
subsequent layers will be on top now
what<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.659> here<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> layer<00:01:08.320> for

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
what I have here is a layer for

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800 
what I have here is a layer for
registration<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.300> just<00:01:10.479> have<00:01:10.630> my<00:01:10.780> little

registration so I just have my little
Reg<00:01:11.170> marks<00:01:11.530> which<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:11.950> fine

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
Reg marks which is fine

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.120 
Reg marks which is fine
I<00:01:12.400> can<00:01:12.850> leave<00:01:13.000> those<00:01:13.180> on<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:14.650> start

I can leave those on and to start
working<00:01:15.310> creating<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.060> artwork<00:01:16.390> I'll<00:01:16.690> create

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
working creating the artwork I'll create

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.039 
working creating the artwork I'll create
a<00:01:17.229> new<00:01:17.320> layer<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:19.000> can<00:01:19.030> go<00:01:19.329> ahead<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.719> go<00:01:19.899> in

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
a new layer and I can go ahead and go in

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.830 
a new layer and I can go ahead and go in
and<00:01:20.200> call<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.560> color<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:24.780> okay<00:01:25.780> so

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
screen printers we can copy and paste

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.709 
screen printers we can copy and paste
that<00:01:40.409> bring<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.399> down<00:01:41.609> here<00:01:43.700> do<00:01:44.700> whoops

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
that bring it down here do whoops

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:53.840 
that bring it down here do whoops
do<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.899> layers<00:01:50.990> okay<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.429> remember<00:01:53.429> we're

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
do it in layers okay so remember we're

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.459 
do it in layers okay so remember we're
not<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.240> creating<00:01:54.689> art<00:01:54.869> today<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.289> just

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
not really creating art today I'm just

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
okay so see how very basic spot color

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.620 
okay so see how very basic spot color
artwork<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.170> easy<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.579> point<00:02:14.880> we

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
artwork can be easy now at this point we

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.850 
artwork can be easy now at this point we
can<00:02:15.810> create<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.319> new<00:02:16.680> layer<00:02:18.290> okay<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.650> call

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
can create a new layer okay we can call

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.480 
can create a new layer okay we can call
that<00:02:19.890> color<00:02:20.459> too

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.520 

okay<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.390> work<00:02:27.510> make<00:02:27.780> sure<00:02:27.930> your<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
okay and work make sure your on the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.940 
okay and work make sure your on the
layer<00:02:29.060> there's<00:02:30.060> color<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.720> turn<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
layer there's color one turn it on and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.190 
layer there's color one turn it on and
off<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.370> color<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.210> has<00:02:33.420> nothing<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.020> yet

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
off and color two has nothing on it yet

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
off and color two has nothing on it yet
so<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:36.180> know<00:02:36.240> let's<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.760> we're

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
so I don't know let's just if we're

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.730 
so I don't know let's just if we're
gonna<00:02:39.120> create<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.510> basic<00:02:39.990> shape<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:41.090> sorts

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:57.180 

let's<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:46.950> this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.580 

and<00:02:57.610> let's<00:02:58.600> say<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.050> wanted<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> like

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
and let's say you know we wanted to like

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.100 
and let's say you know we wanted to like
this<00:02:59.860> make<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.430> see-through<00:03:00.870> I'm<00:03:01.870> just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
this make that see-through I'm just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.950 
this make that see-through I'm just
fooling<00:03:02.680> around<00:03:02.860> here<00:03:03.400> we'll<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:04.540> make<00:03:04.690> like

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
fooling around here we'll just make like

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.510 
fooling around here we'll just make like
a<00:03:05.230> crosshair<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.100> something

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
a crosshair or something

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.160 
a crosshair or something
okay<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:09.580> here's<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:11.260> right<00:03:13.110> there's<00:03:14.110> one

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
okay so here's all right there's one

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.600 
okay so here's all right there's one
little<00:03:15.000> circle<00:03:16.920> okay<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.100> we're<00:03:18.220> still<00:03:18.460> on

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
little circle okay and we're still on

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.120 
little circle okay and we're still on
layer<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.330> two<00:03:19.660> or<00:03:19.930> color<00:03:20.440> two<00:03:20.770> layer

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
layer the two or color two layer

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.770 
layer the two or color two layer
whatever<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.700> want<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> call<00:03:22.240> it<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.630> can

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
whatever you want to call it so you can

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.610 
whatever you want to call it so you can
see<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:22.990> can<00:03:23.170> toggle<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.710> on<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:23.890> off<00:03:25.560> okay<00:03:26.560> so

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
see I can toggle it on and off okay so

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.890 
see I can toggle it on and off okay so
now<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.190> wanted<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.910> make<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> couple<00:03:28.360> simple

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
now I wanted to make a couple simple

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
now I wanted to make a couple simple
lines<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:30.190> make<00:03:30.310> them<00:03:30.460> quick<00:03:30.730> for<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.320> video

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
lines to make them quick for this video

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.199 
lines to make them quick for this video
we<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.180> do<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.450> something<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:34.840> this

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.179 

and<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:40.109> know<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.290> guys<00:03:40.530> should<00:03:40.829> know<00:03:40.980> how<00:03:41.129> to

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
and you know you guys should know how to

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.979 
and you know you guys should know how to
do<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> lot<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.969> stuff<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.689> is<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
do a lot of the stuff but this is the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.580 
do a lot of the stuff but this is the
idea<00:03:43.019> we're<00:03:43.920> working<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.430> layers<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:46.379> let's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
idea we're working in layers so let's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.970 
idea we're working in layers so let's
see<00:03:46.909> this<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.269> height<00:03:48.480> there<00:03:49.409> we<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.920> can

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
see this is the height there we go I can

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.670 
see this is the height there we go I can
make<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:50.909> longer<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.290> I'll<00:03:52.439> copy

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
make that a little longer so I'll copy

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:01.339 
make that a little longer so I'll copy
that<00:03:53.069> paste<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.969> and<00:03:54.239> we're<00:03:55.140> gonna<00:03:58.189> rotate<00:04:00.349> ok

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
that paste it and we're gonna rotate ok

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.979 
that paste it and we're gonna rotate ok
so<00:04:01.409> here's<00:04:01.889> like<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.129> little<00:04:02.870> crosshair<00:04:03.870> of

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
so here's like a little crosshair of

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.229 
so here's like a little crosshair of
sorts

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
sorts

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:14.059 
sorts
oops<00:04:09.500> okay<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:11.430> easier<00:04:12.859> just<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.980> use

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
oops okay here it's easier just to use

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.920 
oops okay here it's easier just to use
the<00:04:14.310> scale<00:04:14.549> tool

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.300 

and<00:04:19.320> then<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.889> got<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> beef<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.120> little

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and then I got a beef it up a little

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.730 
and then I got a beef it up a little
whoops

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
whoops

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.330 
whoops
something<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.860> that

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.320 

I'll<00:04:29.850> point<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.540> hard<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.870> work<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.290> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
I'll point it's hard to work in this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.750 
I'll point it's hard to work in this
okay

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
okay

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.040 
okay
trying<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.180> straightened<00:04:36.600> out<00:04:36.780> for

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
trying to get this straightened out for

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.560 
trying to get this straightened out for
you<00:04:37.260> okay<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:37.890> really<00:04:38.340> simple<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:39.090> want<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.450> make

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
you okay so really simple I want to make

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.500 
you okay so really simple I want to make
this<00:04:39.690> video<00:04:39.870> too<00:04:40.080> long<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:41.130> there's<00:04:41.450> like<00:04:42.450> a

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
this video too long so there's like a

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.720 
this video too long so there's like a
little<00:04:42.750> crosshair<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:43.950> not<00:04:44.100> perfect<00:04:44.370> of

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
little crosshair and it's not perfect of

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.480 
little crosshair and it's not perfect of
course<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.270> that's<00:04:45.360> color<00:04:45.990> too<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.620> say<00:04:47.310> we

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
course and that's color too so say we

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.870 
course and that's color too so say we
wanted<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> take<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.480> copy<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.010> we

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
wanted to take this copy it and we

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.380 
wanted to take this copy it and we
wanted<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.240> make<00:04:51.420> kind<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.800> two<00:04:53.390> two

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
wanted to make kind of like it's two two

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.700 
wanted to make kind of like it's two two
colors<00:04:54.840> two<00:04:55.530> registration<00:04:56.250> marks<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.500> can

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
colors two registration marks and I can

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.380 
colors two registration marks and I can
paste<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.490> layer<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.850> saw<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.300> just

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
paste it on that layer you saw I just

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.630 
paste it on that layer you saw I just
created<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.350> new<00:05:01.380> layer<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.950> we<00:05:02.070> can<00:05:02.250> call<00:05:02.430> it

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
created a new layer and we can call it

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.910 
created a new layer and we can call it
color<00:05:05.030> three<00:05:06.030> all<00:05:06.900> right<00:05:07.050> all<00:05:07.620> right<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.800> hope

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
color three all right all right I hope

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.500 
color three all right all right I hope
that<00:05:08.100> wasn't<00:05:08.280> too<00:05:08.460> confusing<00:05:08.760> because<00:05:09.270> see

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
that wasn't too confusing because see

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.210 
that wasn't too confusing because see
what<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:09.660> did<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.960> just<00:05:10.110> keep<00:05:10.500> creating<00:05:10.800> new

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
what I did I just keep creating new

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.300 
what I did I just keep creating new
layers<00:05:11.720> all<00:05:12.720> right<00:05:12.870> now<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:13.290> one<00:05:16.040> maybe<00:05:17.040> we

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
layers all right now this one maybe we

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.580 
layers all right now this one maybe we
want<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.670> kind<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.090> as<00:05:19.080> though<00:05:19.380> they<00:05:19.530> were

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
want it kind of like as though they were

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.190 
want it kind of like as though they were
getting<00:05:19.950> lined<00:05:20.220> up<00:05:23.420> okay<00:05:24.420> so<00:05:24.480> you<00:05:24.750> see<00:05:25.020> how

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
getting lined up okay so you see how

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.680 
getting lined up okay so you see how
that<00:05:25.230> is<00:05:25.620> it's<00:05:26.520> really<00:05:26.580> simple<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.420> four

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
that is it's really simple like four

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.890 
that is it's really simple like four
simple<00:05:28.370> colors<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:29.850> where<00:05:30.180> this<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.540> okay

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
simple colors and and where this is okay

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
in a much more layered situation where

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.659 
in a much more layered situation where
you<00:06:20.159> have<00:06:20.629> shapes<00:06:21.629> that<00:06:21.960> are<00:06:22.020> going<00:06:22.379> to<00:06:22.669> you

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.589 
know let me just kind of over lap each
other<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.129> we<00:06:29.310> were<00:06:29.430> working<00:06:29.849> on<00:06:29.969> layers<00:06:30.240> and

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
other and we were working on layers and

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.450 
other and we were working on layers and
you<00:06:30.659> need<00:06:30.840> it<00:06:30.960> to<00:06:31.050> overlap<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:31.919> do<00:06:32.039> stuff<00:06:32.310> like

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
you need it to overlap and do stuff like

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.779 
you need it to overlap and do stuff like
this<00:06:32.819> where<00:06:33.120> maybe<00:06:33.419> this<00:06:34.199> is<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.129> color<00:06:35.430> and

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
this where maybe this is one color and

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.300 
this where maybe this is one color and
this<00:06:36.240> is<00:06:36.389> another<00:06:36.629> color<00:06:37.020> but<00:06:37.830> you<00:06:37.860> don't<00:06:38.099> want

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
this is another color but you don't want

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.070 
this is another color but you don't want
them<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.639> over<00:06:38.909> print<00:06:39.210> now<00:06:39.599> that's<00:06:39.779> a<00:06:39.930> whole

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
them to over print now that's a whole

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.709 
them to over print now that's a whole
different<00:06:40.110> story<00:06:40.759> okay<00:06:41.759> and<00:06:41.939> that<00:06:42.090> that's<00:06:42.419> a

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
different story okay and that that's a

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.899 
different story okay and that that's a
little<00:06:42.930> bit<00:06:43.110> different<00:06:43.560> but<00:06:44.340> I<00:06:44.550> thought<00:06:44.849> I

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
little bit different but I thought I

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.969 
little bit different but I thought I
would<00:06:45.029> just<00:06:45.240> show<00:06:45.419> you<00:06:45.479> this<00:06:45.810> for<00:06:46.469> very<00:06:46.650> basic

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
would just show you this for very basic

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.010 
would just show you this for very basic
spot<00:06:47.580> colors<00:06:48.000> and<00:06:48.240> for<00:06:48.419> when<00:06:48.539> you're<00:06:48.689> starting

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
spot colors and for when you're starting

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.580 
spot colors and for when you're starting
out<00:06:49.349> working<00:06:50.219> in<00:06:50.580> layers<00:06:50.819> can<00:06:51.210> be<00:06:51.270> very<00:06:51.629> good

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
out working in layers can be very good

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.649 
out working in layers can be very good
to<00:06:52.919> do<00:06:53.159> it<00:06:53.430> could<00:06:53.550> be<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.669> good<00:06:53.849> habit<00:06:54.360> to<00:06:54.539> get

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
to do it could be a good habit to get

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.550 
to do it could be a good habit to get
into<00:06:55.250> okay<00:06:56.250> but<00:06:56.490> as<00:06:56.639> you<00:06:57.270> get<00:06:57.509> more<00:06:57.750> complex<00:06:58.289> in

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
into okay but as you get more complex in

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.010 
into okay but as you get more complex in
your<00:06:58.680> artwork<00:06:59.099> you<00:06:59.610> will<00:06:59.819> need<00:07:00.210> to<00:07:00.509> learn<00:07:00.690> how

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
your artwork you will need to learn how

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.480 
your artwork you will need to learn how
to<00:07:01.050> do<00:07:01.379> different<00:07:01.710> things<00:07:02.370> and<00:07:02.969> you<00:07:03.810> know

you'll you'll probably have to learn new

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.619 
you'll you'll probably have to learn new
ways<00:07:07.710> of<00:07:08.250> doing<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.669> same<00:07:08.699> things<00:07:09.240> because

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
it's more complex alright that's it for

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.730 
it's more complex alright that's it for
