alkie<00:00:15.750> were<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> two<00:00:16.350> characters<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.039> do

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
alkie were the two characters that I do

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.920 
alkie were the two characters that I do
not<00:00:17.580> care<00:00:17.910> about<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.240> all<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> thought<00:00:18.720> they

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
not care about at all I thought they

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
not care about at all I thought they
barely<00:00:19.199> got<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.619> development<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.279> they

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
barely got any development and they

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
barely got any development and they
weren't<00:00:20.640> interesting<00:00:21.060> characters<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.990> we

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
weren't interesting characters at all we

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
weren't interesting characters at all we
had<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.250> kiriyama<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.300> hope<00:00:24.720> he

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
had a bit with kiriyama but I hope he

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.089 
had a bit with kiriyama but I hope he
for<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> most<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.070> only

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
for the most part the only

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.419 
for the most part the only
characteristic<00:00:27.000> his<00:00:27.630> character<00:00:28.199> had<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
characteristic his character had was I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.870 
characteristic his character had was I
love<00:00:30.029> Yui<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> he's<00:00:32.520> easygoing

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
love Yui that's it and he's easygoing

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
love Yui that's it and he's easygoing
and<00:00:33.300> whatever<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.899> he<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.620> boring

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and whatever but he was really boring

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.569 
and whatever but he was really boring
and<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:36.000> episode<00:00:36.600> developed<00:00:37.530> both<00:00:37.770> curiata

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and this episode developed both curiata

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
and this episode developed both curiata
and<00:00:38.730> alkies<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.870> why<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.350> liked<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and alkies that's why I really liked it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
and alkies that's why I really liked it
because<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> characters<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.450> kind

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
because now all the characters are kind

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
because now all the characters are kind
of<00:00:43.200> leveling<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.920> terms<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> development<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
of leveling in terms of development and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
of leveling in terms of development and
that's<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.320> because

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that's what I really want to see because

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's what I really want to see because
those<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.280> characters<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.629> felt<00:00:48.840> like

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
those two characters I really felt like

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
those two characters I really felt like
they<00:00:49.079> could<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.770> them<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> finally

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
they could do more with them and finally

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
they could do more with them and finally
they<00:00:51.000> started<00:00:51.390> doing<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.020> them<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.559> I

they started doing more with them what I

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
feels like all that time was wasted when

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.580 
feels like all that time was wasted when
instead<00:01:15.810> he<00:01:15.930> could<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> been<00:01:16.290> having<00:01:16.439> fun

instead he could have been having fun
I'm<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.250> saying<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.700> study<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.299> but

I'm not saying don't study at all but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
I'm not saying don't study at all but
enjoy<00:01:19.290> life<00:01:19.590> while<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
enjoy life while you can because you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
enjoy life while you can because you
never<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.350> might<00:01:22.560> die<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.159> that's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
never know when you might die and that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
never know when you might die and that's

just because he sent that one line it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
just because he sent that one line it
