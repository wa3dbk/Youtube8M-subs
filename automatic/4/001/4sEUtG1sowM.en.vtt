00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.160
 Michael all 10 18 has ins 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 Wishes concert written 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.119
 I can not exercise right now because 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.460
 I do a vacation job then matter 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.810
 in many federal states 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.170
 But I have to carry a lot at work 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.279
 Muscle mass does not lose 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.500
 absolutely if you had to carry a lot 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.570
 you have muscular activity when you are muscular 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 I have a lot of activity then 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 Assume that you and if you have a lot 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 carry 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 mainz then I believe that you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.739
 really carry a lot or if you have a lot 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 I think that you wear a lot 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 usually wear and then I have the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 muscular activity that is one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 already very clear and whether and how 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.579
 you may lose a lot of muscle mass 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.570
 Of course you have to go through that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.160
 control diet if I of course 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 I have to use more fuel again 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.680
 more is not logical 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.960
 More knows where it will be but more 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 carbohydrates more calories 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.619
 so ask reinhold I would know 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.630
 not why the body then muscle mass 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.490
 if you want to break down permanently or if 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.420
 So you have to carry things over and over again 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.729
 I would not worry about that personally 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 as I said that is dependent on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.150
 how long is this vacation? 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.990
 if he is only two weeks one can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.600
 just two weeks that is bullshit yes there 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.939
 You do not have to do that for a while 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 does not do that you do not have to do anything longer 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.630
 to have real muscle breakdown and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 second, it is natural for yours 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.210
 nutrition i have what are you doing for that 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.280
 to get muscles for a purely vacation job 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 yes, if you have to wear four then you do 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.150
 actually a lot and everyone 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.579
 day for the maintenance of muscle mass all over 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 clearly , first of all , there is more analysis 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.740
 completed by someone on 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 Assembly works when the eight hours 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.040
 in the or eight and a half hours in the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.509
 then works is the montage works 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 eight and a half hours in training we 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.290
 had the tape on it with montage 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.540
 and we had the tie with them 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.210
 in training and in training he only has 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 all 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.830
 Low calories consumed more 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 that means working in the assembly 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.250
 if you're wearing a lot here and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.080
 then you are muscular 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 activity and do you have calories 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.880
 consumed and by and by the time 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.580
 for the duration of the vacation job it is 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.640
 of course depending on if and how much 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.280
 muscle mass muscle mass muscle mass you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.170
 but lose I'm assuming none 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.459
 if you are just with the diet 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.459
 take care of that to compensate
