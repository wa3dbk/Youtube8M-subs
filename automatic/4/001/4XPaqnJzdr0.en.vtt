great fighting game they should

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.490 
great fighting game they should
definitely<00:03:07.819> make<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:07.970> sequel<00:03:08.329> but<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.079> just<00:03:09.349> feel

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
definitely make a sequel but I just feel

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.629 
definitely make a sequel but I just feel
like<00:03:09.590> if<00:03:09.859> there<00:03:10.010> will<00:03:10.159> be<00:03:10.220> an<00:03:10.370> injustice<00:03:10.579> to

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
like if there will be an injustice to

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.670 
like if there will be an injustice to
which<00:03:11.209> there<00:03:11.480> probably<00:03:11.510> will<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.290> will

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
which there probably will be it will

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.179 
which there probably will be it will
come<00:03:12.859> out<00:03:13.359> 2015<00:03:14.359> but<00:03:15.109> what<00:03:15.409> I<00:03:15.439> think<00:03:15.859> we<00:03:15.980> could

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
come out 2015 but what I think we could

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.849 
come out 2015 but what I think we could
