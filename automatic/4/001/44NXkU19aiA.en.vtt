in<00:00:15.469> this<00:00:15.679> video<00:00:15.860> we're<00:00:16.160> gonna<00:00:16.219> use<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:16.640> 2002

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
in this video we're gonna use this 2002

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.510 
in this video we're gonna use this 2002
suburban<00:00:18.050> to<00:00:18.289> show<00:00:18.529> you<00:00:18.590> how<00:00:18.949> you<00:00:19.010> can<00:00:19.220> find

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
suburban to show you how you can find

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.710 
suburban to show you how you can find
your<00:00:20.060> final<00:00:20.390> driver<00:00:20.810> or<00:00:21.320> axle<00:00:22.130> gear<00:00:22.369> ratio<00:00:22.820> you

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
your final driver or axle gear ratio you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.440 
your final driver or axle gear ratio you
can<00:00:23.779> see<00:00:24.020> I'm<00:00:24.140> opening<00:00:24.560> up<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.220> cover<00:00:26.119> on<00:00:26.390> the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
can see I'm opening up the cover on the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.929 
can see I'm opening up the cover on the
rear<00:00:26.779> axle<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.439> while<00:00:28.310> I'm<00:00:28.430> doing<00:00:28.460> that<00:00:28.730> I'll

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
rear axle and while I'm doing that I'll

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.950 
rear axle and while I'm doing that I'll
I'll<00:00:29.509> talk<00:00:29.750> a<00:00:29.779> little<00:00:29.900> bit<00:00:30.169> about<00:00:30.199> axle<00:00:30.829> ratio

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
I'll talk a little bit about axle ratio

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.030 
I'll talk a little bit about axle ratio
axle<00:00:32.960> ratio<00:00:33.290> is<00:00:33.790> basically<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.540> number<00:00:36.350> of

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
axle ratio is basically the number of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.639 
axle ratio is basically the number of
turns<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.640> your<00:00:37.730> drive<00:00:37.969> shaft<00:00:38.000> turns<00:00:38.899> to

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
turns that your drive shaft turns to

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.920 
turns that your drive shaft turns to
each<00:00:39.860> turn<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.430> your<00:00:40.550> wheel<00:00:40.790> we<00:00:41.510> know<00:00:41.629> on<00:00:41.809> this

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
each turn of your wheel we know on this

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.290 
each turn of your wheel we know on this
suburban<00:00:42.590> or<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:43.219> find<00:00:43.430> out<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:43.940> axle

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
suburban or we find out that the axle

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.080 
suburban or we find out that the axle
ratio<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.780> three<00:00:45.140> point<00:00:45.379> seven<00:00:45.649> three<00:00:46.100> two<00:00:46.340> one

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
ratio is three point seven three two one

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.150 
ratio is three point seven three two one
so<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.510> means<00:00:47.540> that<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.110> driveshaft

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
so that means that the driveshaft

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.630 
so that means that the driveshaft
turns<00:00:49.760> three<00:00:50.180> point<00:00:50.420> seven<00:00:50.720> three<00:00:50.750> times<00:00:51.640> to

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
turns three point seven three times to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.490 
turns three point seven three times to
each<00:00:52.850> turn<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.510> wheels<00:00:53.690> if<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:54.260> think

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
each turn of the wheels if you think

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.979 
each turn of the wheels if you think
about<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.310> know<00:00:55.370> driving<00:00:55.640> an<00:00:55.850> old<00:00:56.000> writing<00:00:56.900> an

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
about you know driving an old writing an

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.910 
about you know driving an old writing an
old<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.440> bicycle<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:59.870> ratio<00:01:00.290> is<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.649> number

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
old a bicycle your ratio is the number

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.260 
old a bicycle your ratio is the number
of<00:01:00.950> times<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.460> turn<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.760> pedals<00:01:02.060> to<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
of times you turn the pedals to the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.520 
of times you turn the pedals to the
number<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.630> times<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:05.200> that<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.350> wheel

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
number of times that the that the wheel

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.609 
number of times that the that the wheel
goes<00:01:06.740> around<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.130> bike<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.229> lower<00:01:09.229> gear

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
goes around on the bike the lower gear

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.340 
goes around on the bike the lower gear
ratios<00:01:10.600> which<00:01:11.600> are<00:01:11.720> actually<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.079> higher

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ratios which are actually the higher

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.850 
ratios which are actually the higher
number<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:13.750> lower<00:01:14.750> gear<00:01:15.110> first<00:01:15.409> gear<00:01:15.590> you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
number so lower gear first gear you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.280 
number so lower gear first gear you
would<00:01:15.979> say<00:01:16.159> pedal<00:01:16.490> four<00:01:17.000> turns<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.079> turn

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
would say pedal four turns to one turn

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.990 
would say pedal four turns to one turn
in<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.470> wheels<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:18.860> it's<00:01:19.010> easier<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.460> pedal

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
in the wheels so it's easier to pedal

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820 
in the wheels so it's easier to pedal
but<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.810> wheel<00:01:20.960> does<00:01:21.140> not<00:01:21.260> turn<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.590> fast

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
but the wheel does not turn is fast

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.270 
but the wheel does not turn is fast
higher<00:01:22.760> gears<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.990> lower<00:01:24.200> ratios<00:01:24.710> say<00:01:25.220> you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
higher gears the lower ratios say you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.880 
higher gears the lower ratios say you
turn<00:01:25.549> one<00:01:26.420> turn<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:26.930> pedals<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.320> one<00:01:27.650> turn

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
turn one turn of the pedals to one turn

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.300 
turn one turn of the pedals to one turn
of<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.540> wheels<00:01:29.540> you're<00:01:30.409> pedaling<00:01:30.770> harder<00:01:31.130> but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
of the wheels you're pedaling harder but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.270 
of the wheels you're pedaling harder but
you're<00:01:31.430> also<00:01:31.670> going<00:01:31.970> faster<00:01:32.650> okay<00:01:33.650> as<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.250> can

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
you're also going faster okay as you can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.410 
you're also going faster okay as you can
see<00:01:34.490> as<00:01:34.580> we<00:01:34.700> open<00:01:34.970> up<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.680> ring<00:01:36.920> gear<00:01:37.190> is

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
see as we open up on the ring gear is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.370 
see as we open up on the ring gear is
stamped<00:01:38.420> two<00:01:38.750> numbers<00:01:39.140> 41<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.400> 11<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:42.049> we<00:01:42.229> go

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
stamped two numbers 41 and 11 and we go

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.250 
stamped two numbers 41 and 11 and we go
to<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.560> computer<00:01:42.830> put<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.670> calculator<00:01:44.260> 41

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
to the computer put in the calculator 41

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.000 
to the computer put in the calculator 41
divided<00:01:45.860> by<00:01:45.979> 11<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:47.229> three<00:01:48.229> point<00:01:48.470> seven<00:01:48.680> two

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
divided by 11 is three point seven two

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.859 
divided by 11 is three point seven two
seven<00:01:49.220> two<00:01:49.460> seven<00:01:49.640> two<00:01:49.909> which<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.299> three<00:01:50.330> point

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
seven two seven two which is three point

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.250 
seven two seven two which is three point
seven<00:01:51.080> three<00:01:51.820> okay<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:53.659> basically<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
seven three okay so it's basically the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.620 
seven three okay so it's basically the
the<00:01:54.500> 41<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.010> 11<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.490> 41<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.150> number<00:01:56.510> of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the 41 in the 11 the 41 is the number of

teeth that are on that larger ring gear
the<00:01:58.850> 11<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.540> number<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.960> teeth<00:02:00.170> there<00:02:00.439> on

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the 11 is the number of teeth there on

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.100 
the 11 is the number of teeth there on
the<00:02:00.680> smaller<00:02:02.049> pinion<00:02:03.049> gear<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.479> this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the smaller pinion gear and this is this

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.450 
the smaller pinion gear and this is this
can<00:02:06.259> be<00:02:06.350> important<00:02:06.799> if<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.040> do<00:02:07.130> things<00:02:07.340> like

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
can be important if you do things like

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.550 
can be important if you do things like
toing<00:02:07.850> toing<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.450> generally<00:02:08.780> want<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.229> a
