what would be on a sewing machine and
then<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> course<00:01:48.899> rotate<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> rangefinder<00:01:49.890> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
then of course rotate the rangefinder in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
then of course rotate the rangefinder in
gear<00:01:50.610> around<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:53.009> clean<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.939> actual

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
gear around there to clean this actual

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.709 
gear around there to clean this actual
gear<00:01:54.930> itself<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.710> could<00:01:56.390> soak<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> some

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
gear itself you could soak it in some

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.120 
gear itself you could soak it in some
lighter<00:01:58.110> fluid<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.460> bit

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
lighter fluid for a little bit

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.490 
lighter fluid for a little bit
then<00:02:00.520> let<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.820> air<00:02:00.969> dry<00:02:01.000> dry<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:01.750> off<00:02:01.960> before

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
then let it air dry dry it off before

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.170 
then let it air dry dry it off before
you<00:02:02.789> put<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:04.360> back<00:02:04.479> on<00:02:04.719> now<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:06.789> remove<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
you put it back on now to remove the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.449 
you put it back on now to remove the
lens<00:02:07.390> it's<00:02:07.659> fairly<00:02:07.960> simple<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.369> a

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
lens it's fairly simple it's just a

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.680 
lens it's fairly simple it's just a
screw<00:02:09.819> mount<00:02:10.030> lens<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.660> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
screw mount lens there it is now you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.550 
screw mount lens there it is now you
have<00:02:16.870> access<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.620> leaf<00:02:17.830> shutter<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
have access to the leaf shutter and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.030 
have access to the leaf shutter and
everything<00:02:20.560> else<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:23.349> can<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:23.800> take

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
everything else you can actually take

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.229 
everything else you can actually take
the<00:02:24.280> lens<00:02:24.489> apart<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.780> only<00:02:26.880> three<00:02:27.880> screws

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the lens apart there's only three screws

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.990 
the lens apart there's only three screws
on<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.940> believe<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.660> more<00:02:31.900> advanced

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
on here I believe that for more advanced

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.370 
on here I believe that for more advanced
messing<00:02:34.000> around<00:02:34.120> with<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.630> camera<00:02:35.049> I<00:02:35.200> have

not done that myself

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.880 
not done that myself
I'm<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.230> worried<00:02:38.440> about<00:02:38.470> making<00:02:38.860> sure

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
I'm just worried about making sure

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.789 
I'm just worried about making sure
everything<00:02:39.459> works<00:02:39.670> okay<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:41.290> any<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.650> more

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
everything works okay if any of the more

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.500 
everything works okay if any of the more
advanced<00:02:42.069> features<00:02:42.130> are<00:02:42.549> quite<00:02:42.670> beyond<00:02:43.150> me

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
advanced features are quite beyond me

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.320 
advanced features are quite beyond me
now<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.920> can<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> lens<00:02:45.549> off<00:02:45.849> right<00:02:46.180> if

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
now you can get the lens off right if

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.610 
now you can get the lens off right if
you<00:02:46.450> want<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.660> fix

rangefinder readings you're gonna screw

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.440

to<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.420> infinity<00:03:51.959> position<00:03:53.360> now<00:03:54.360> from<00:03:54.930> here

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
to the infinity position now from here

to the infinity position now from here
you're<00:03:55.620> gonna<00:03:55.799> take<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.430> lens<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:59.780> screw<00:04:00.780> it

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
you're gonna take the lens and screw it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.009 
you're gonna take the lens and screw it
from<00:04:01.200> my<00:04:01.350> position<00:04:01.920> what<00:04:02.220> would<00:04:02.340> be

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
from my position what would be

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.490 
from my position what would be
counterclockwise<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.260> teeth

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
counterclockwise just so that the teeth

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.220 
counterclockwise just so that the teeth
of<00:04:07.829> this<00:04:08.400> gear<00:04:08.850> can<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.299> touch<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.840> start<00:04:10.109> of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
of this gear can just touch the start of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.250 
of this gear can just touch the start of
the<00:04:10.350> lens<00:04:10.609> that's<00:04:11.609> so<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.120> when<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.049> set

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
the lens that's so that when this is set

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.080 
the lens that's so that when this is set
to<00:04:13.290> infinity<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.489> lens<00:04:14.670> will<00:04:15.090> be<00:04:15.120> set<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:16.010> its

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
to infinity the lens will be set to its

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.210 
to infinity the lens will be set to its
farthest<00:04:18.090> distance<00:04:18.750> which<00:04:19.079> we<00:04:19.829> assume<00:04:20.100> if

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
farthest distance which we assume if

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.390 
farthest distance which we assume if
it's<00:04:20.400> Callao<00:04:20.669> calibrated<00:04:21.600> correctly<00:04:21.630> is

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
it's Callao calibrated correctly is

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.230 
it's Callao calibrated correctly is
actually<00:04:23.400> infinity<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.550> we're<00:04:26.639> just<00:04:26.669> gonna<00:04:26.850> go

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
actually infinity so we're just gonna go

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.870 
actually infinity so we're just gonna go
ahead<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.690> mess<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.410> where<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.160> lens<00:04:29.430> is

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
ahead and mess with where the lens is

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.930 
ahead and mess with where the lens is
placed<00:04:30.389> with

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
placed with

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.760 
placed with
the<00:04:33.940> gear<00:04:34.210> itself<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:35.229> teeth<00:04:35.470> will

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
the gear itself the teeth will

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.219 
the gear itself the teeth will
definitely<00:04:36.159> match<00:04:36.280> up<00:04:36.460> with<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.669> rangefinder

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
definitely match up with the rangefinder

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.420 
definitely match up with the rangefinder
you<00:04:38.229> might<00:04:38.409> have<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.690> twist<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.979> lens<00:04:42.220> a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
you might have to twist the lens a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.689 
you might have to twist the lens a
little<00:04:42.460> bit<00:04:43.620> until<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.650> get<00:04:44.889> these<00:04:45.159> two<00:04:45.430> to

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
little bit until you get these two to

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.899 
little bit until you get these two to
come<00:04:45.909> in<00:04:46.090> into<00:04:46.870> place<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:48.009> make<00:04:48.039> sure<00:04:48.159> push<00:04:48.729> it

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
come in into place to make sure push it

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.020 
come in into place to make sure push it
all<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.150> way<00:04:49.360> over<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.930> infinity<00:04:50.669> mines<00:04:51.669> close

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
all the way over to infinity mines close

all the way over to infinity mines close
close<00:04:52.509> enough<00:04:53.370> from<00:04:54.370> there<00:04:55.500> that's<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:57.250> lens

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
close enough from there that's this lens

should<00:05:16.720> go<00:05:16.900> on<00:05:17.080> pretty<00:05:17.290> easily<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:17.919> think<00:05:24.270> this

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
should go on pretty easily I think this

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.510 
should go on pretty easily I think this
down<00:05:27.750> actually<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:29.380> think<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.830> not<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.100> problem

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
down actually I think I not the problem

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.180 
down actually I think I not the problem
is<00:05:30.810> turn<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.990> lens<00:05:32.139> first<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.949> three

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
is turn the lens first of the three

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.790 
is turn the lens first of the three
position<00:05:33.729> setting<00:05:34.510> which<00:05:35.229> you<00:05:35.350> gotta<00:05:35.560> line<00:05:35.770> up

pretty<00:05:36.250> much<00:05:36.460> exactly<00:05:37.260> and<00:05:38.260> then<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:38.830> can<00:05:38.979> go

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
pretty much exactly and then you can go

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.719 
pretty much exactly and then you can go
ahead<00:05:41.820> screw<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:43.000> lens<00:05:43.180> cap<00:05:43.540> back<00:05:44.470> on<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.580> now

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
ahead screw the lens cap back on so now

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.390 
ahead screw the lens cap back on so now
you<00:05:45.790> fix<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.870> rangefinder<00:05:47.470> setting<00:05:48.160> it'll

minutes<00:07:10.740> to<00:07:11.740> explain<00:07:12.130> this<00:07:12.400> but<00:07:12.699> I<00:07:12.729> thought

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
minutes to explain this but I thought

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.460 
minutes to explain this but I thought
I'd<00:07:13.060> go<00:07:13.150> through<00:07:13.240> it<00:07:13.539> kind<00:07:13.870> of<00:07:13.960> slowly

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
I'd go through it kind of slowly
