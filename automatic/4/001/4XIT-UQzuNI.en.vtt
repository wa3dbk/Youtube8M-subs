 giraschi the intrigued mone x and y 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.509
 so that's the way it was so you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.080
 show my coach and a dog because 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.090
 I already did the safer event 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.779
 some time it happened but you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 can find it here my regret of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 chimeras and the inmates tell me you in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.239
 shops 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.229
 I think it would be called watch 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.350

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.620
 this forced rest to explain you a 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.360

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.170
