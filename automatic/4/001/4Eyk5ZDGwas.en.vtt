00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.439
 general 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.840
 the victor and leo brothers form one of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.990
 greatest successes in the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.689
 brazil singers since child more 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.760
 it was from 2006 that the double 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.230
 has conquered the hearts of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.230
 in love with the whole country 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.240
 ae 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 also on line 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 i 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.610
 I think you 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.540
 a subtotal 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.039
 We gave ourselves to music. 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.590
 professionally, right? 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.950
 we took it seriously and takes it seriously 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.259
 It 's that, it's independent for us. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 known and we are not we sing 15 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.890
 years in bars and we have done five years of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.899
 singing class 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.859
 we did three years of vocal appreciation with 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.539
 hunger 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.670
 we take seriously we want to learn what 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.799
 we do and do to make the best 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.969
 possible for anyone who has been listening 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.039
 wherever 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.539
 we got tired of the inside of a mine 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.500
 little town called playing good 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.869
 little tiny 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.679
 Let's go to Belo Horizonte. We lived eight years ago. 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.179
 years later they are paulo almost seven years 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.519
 but that was not a fight to do 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.680
 success was a struggle to learn the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.840
 do better every day 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.329
 and I think that whoever does this is from 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.650
 profession exercising 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.769
 if you struggle to do your best 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.769
 you end up coming in places where 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.290
 your footsteps would never dream that you 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.150
 come you do not stop growing 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.700
 and we are like this until today we 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.859
 takes the stage to learn right we 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 today here in maranhão has the privilege 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.290
 to receive a beautiful audience always in 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 shows that sings our songs a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.670
 little educated this kind of thing to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.940
 people is a huge responsibility. 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.560
 so every time I went back to Maranhão 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.690
 or wherever we are we 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.349
 come back with a better and better show than 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.870
 before 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.599
 the idea is to always learn victor example 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.900
 is the most prized sertaneja duo of 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.239
 ten years have been a note 10 in all 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.639
 that is produced in this period have gained 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.609
 virtually all of this has gained nothing yet 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.760
 dude just because a lot of people have one thing 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.019
 interesting then it is expected that the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.459
 people conquered what happened to us 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.680
 It is connected that in what we can 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.359
 to conquer still from now on 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.910
 so that's why we have said 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.310
 very well that rises on stage thinking about 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.739
 learn and take something new 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.480
 learning some lesson knows every 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.419
 show that happens we learn something new 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.780
 we want to improve and evolve 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.239
 every year is well so we're are 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.450
 more trapped what we can 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.390
 conquer next year 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.190
 What happened? But thank you to the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.459
 people that absorbs our work more 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.310
 going forward the story is this rain 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.739
 and this is the duo that already thrilled 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.690

 this crowd is here and no one is 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.470
 disappointed to the extreme event to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.780

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.360
 Two men 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.820
 in this period the robot split the people 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.449
 sang you fell in love 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.650

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.650
 also on top of which 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.250
 tote he called me and then think there like 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.759

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.920
 in pines 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.920

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.360
 I received lost cpmf 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.990

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:20.159
 Come on, more, just wait.

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:26.370
 of your offer is over and ge 10 only 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.979
 because the history of china are doing 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.460
 we are doing as the best band 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.229
 pine with robert and found half of 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.870
 2012 and particularly after evaluating 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.120
 that it was 10 and that it was then 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.310
 let's join the useful to the pleasant to 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.490
 person from the works but while 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.099
 This is not enough, let's revive tonight. 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.099
 and will go down in history as one of the greatest 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.960
 events that is downloaded maranhense has viewed 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.229
 People use their own songs because we 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.780
 we have satisfied our need 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.340
 repertoire at least for now 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.319
 when this is not possible, people 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.750
 will certainly seek from other sources 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.610
 in other composers 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.800
 It's for us, it's a pretty question. 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.349
 but it is obvious that this gives a 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.280
 identity to our work 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:17.009
 if we produce it composes and interprets 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.289
 I touch that work. 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:22.080
 independent of other productions of 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.750
 other people stay, it's no longer the 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.159
 your face always then somehow 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.529
 we have a greater identity for 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.360
 this the first is very happy that 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.039
 You 're the same, thank you so much. 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.520
 pine tree to maranhão 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:36.930

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.409
 people are very honored we wait 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.409

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.410
