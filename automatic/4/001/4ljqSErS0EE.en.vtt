00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.460
 So these processors that we present today in Geneva 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 it is a vehicle of which one is particularly proud 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.739
 because it's a vehicle that we wanted to position from the start 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.509
 tomas vaitkus pregnant 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.860
 a vehicle that we could say is that we discover it in form 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.619
 photography today in form 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.499
 it's a vehicle that belongs to the upper range 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.480
 so how did we achieve that goal 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.909
 so I think it's been really achieved 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.829
 we proceeded as follows 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.920
 we learned there what we were given 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.810
 and we did everything to enrich it 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.930
 it starts with the slender silhouette of origin 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.660
 but we do not have what we have stressed through 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.700
 the treatment of the waist line 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.770
 with these cd-roms that you see here at the glazing level 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.880
 through this ferry but if city 6 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.240
 treat prominently in the lower part of the spar 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.250
 you see for yourself 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.210
 these elements that continues to the rear of the vehicle 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.240
 give this slender character 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.800
 ocean crosses 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 you know the c3m vehicles in this particularity of being always 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.100
 slender 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 in accordance with the citroen tradition of aerodynamic vehicles 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.430
 but this time with a vehicle 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 large size and can accommodate up to 7 people 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.650
 on the front of the vehicle you will find that the farangs 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 we can evolve in order to come 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.230
 inside the bars and promises you see here 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.830
 it's a new way of dealing 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.130
 brand identity 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.900
 we had until now through his 4 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.540
 this expression of the look with fardc fires but render 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.600
 we have a new operation today 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.280
 with this part of his concerts 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.440
 the wipers in general the four dials general finally one side pause 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.010
 next year 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.950
 reassuring is not imposing maybe even sometimes intimidating 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 we wanted to position ourselves on a bath different territories which consists 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.240
 so that's the reason we played the width 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.090
 and we played the sophistication 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.730
 so that is expressed through the chrome bars and things that 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.760
 you speak 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.679
 and it's also expressed through 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.299
 this type of element here 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.399
 who resume 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.949
 on the sides of the police plate the desire to expand the car 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.389
 on the lower part of the vehicle at the level of the lower air intake 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.619
 main 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.069
 we still have this concern to expand the car 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.809
 with this crisis and after 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:25.989
 activate an error 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.209
 very wide so you see our occupation as I told you at 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.609
 starting to position the sacrosanct in the field 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.269
 mid-range high with such a particular treatment drives the man 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.599
 with notes 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.519
 main line of conduct 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.319
 and that's the reason why I think 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.829
 really proud of the work that was done by the style teams
