the electric porsche in the car and what
you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.460> take<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> look<00:00:26.880> at

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
you can do is you can take a look at

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.740 
you can do is you can take a look at
your<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.199> total<00:00:28.529> amount<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.720> battery<00:00:30.720> power

driving<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:44.000> there's<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:46.110> trip<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
driving on there's the first trip you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
driving on there's the first trip you
can<00:00:47.010> answer<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.480> check

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
can answer back out and you can check

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 
can answer back out and you can check
out<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.530> energy<00:00:49.890> settings<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.090> what

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
out the energy settings so here what

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
out the energy settings so here what
we're<00:00:51.930> looking<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:53.039> total<00:00:53.520> energy

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
we're looking at is your total energy

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
we're looking at is your total energy
settings<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> past<00:00:54.600> five<00:00:54.870> minutes<00:00:55.129> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
settings for the past five minutes the

settings for the past five minutes the
more<00:00:56.399> energy<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.780> higher<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
more energy that you use the higher the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
more energy that you use the higher the
bars<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> less<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.449> lower

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bars will go the less you use the lower

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
bars will go the less you use the lower
the<00:01:00.840> bars<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the bars will go and as you can see to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880 
the bars will go and as you can see to
the<00:01:03.030> far<00:01:03.420> left<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the far left right there what that is is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 
the far left right there what that is is
the<00:01:05.070> braking<00:01:05.489> regeneration<00:01:05.939> cup<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.110> what

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the braking regeneration cup and what

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.859 
the braking regeneration cup and what
you<00:01:07.590> want<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.270> stop<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> want

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you want to do is as you stop you want

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
you want to do is as you stop you want
to<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.520> white<00:01:11.790> dot<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> top

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to use get your the white dot at the top

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390 
to use get your the white dot at the top
to<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> lower<00:01:13.680> portion<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> cup

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to be at the lower portion of the cup

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.179 
to be at the lower portion of the cup
and<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> break<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.350> car<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.009> equipped

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and as you break the car is equipped

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
and as you break the car is equipped
with<00:01:17.310> regenerative<00:01:17.700> brakes<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.320> will

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
with regenerative brakes so you will

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
with regenerative brakes so you will
actually<00:01:19.619> recoup<00:01:20.130> power<00:01:20.750> over<00:01:21.750> time<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.350> when

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
actually recoup power over time and when

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
actually recoup power over time and when
you<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.890> break<00:01:23.130> you'll<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> cool<00:01:24.330> little

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you do break you'll get a cool little

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
you do break you'll get a cool little
logo<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.530> shows<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:26.250> you're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
logo that shows you how much you're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
logo that shows you how much you're
actually<00:01:26.670> saving<00:01:27.080> in<00:01:28.080> terms<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.820> gas<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
actually saving in terms of gas and in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.690 
actually saving in terms of gas and in
terms<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> energy<00:01:31.100> these<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> intervals

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
terms of energy these are the intervals

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
terms of energy these are the intervals
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.000> switch<00:01:33.210> between<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.049> six

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you can switch between one to six

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.580 
you can switch between one to six
minutes<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> look

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
