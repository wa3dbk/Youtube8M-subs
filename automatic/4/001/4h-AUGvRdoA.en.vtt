00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.800 
disinfected I don't need to spray it all
around<00:03:32.009> the<00:03:32.430> roots<00:03:32.669> this<00:03:33.090> orchid<00:03:33.419> is<00:03:33.540> pretty

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
around the roots this orchid is pretty

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.009 
around the roots this orchid is pretty
healthy<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.470> didn't<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.949> any<00:03:35.159> pests<00:03:35.790> i

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
healthy it didn't have any pests i

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.949 
healthy it didn't have any pests i
disinfected<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.139> then<00:03:37.439> so<00:03:37.919> she's<00:03:38.489> good<00:03:38.699> now<00:03:38.959> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
disinfected it then so she's good now so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.899 
disinfected it then so she's good now so
hopefully<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:40.530> see<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.489> hydrogen

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
hopefully you can see this the hydrogen

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.539 
hopefully you can see this the hydrogen
peroxide<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.540> fizzing<00:03:42.989> away<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.680> starting<00:03:44.340> to

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
peroxide is fizzing away is starting to

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.330 
peroxide is fizzing away is starting to
oxidate<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.629> tissue<00:03:45.959> here<00:03:46.470> which<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:47.069> good

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
oxidate the tissue here which is good

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.699 
oxidate the tissue here which is good
it's<00:03:47.579> actually<00:03:48.120> pretty<00:03:48.689> much<00:03:48.930> sealing<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.680> up

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
it's actually pretty much sealing it up

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.550 
it's actually pretty much sealing it up
and<00:03:50.129> if<00:03:50.909> I<00:03:51.120> if<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.720> will<00:03:51.930> wait<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.139> little<00:03:52.379> bit

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and if I if I will wait a little bit

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.429 
and if I if I will wait a little bit
longer<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:53.189> will<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.819> reddish<00:03:54.659> color<00:03:54.689> this

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
longer it will get a reddish color this

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.559 
longer it will get a reddish color this
is<00:03:55.590> how<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.859> usually<00:03:56.069> happens<00:03:56.639> with<00:03:57.180> any<00:03:57.299> sort

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
is how it usually happens with any sort

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.420 
is how it usually happens with any sort
of<00:03:57.750> plant<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.439> is<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.859> it's<00:03:59.069> just<00:03:59.159> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
of plant this is good it's just a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.110 
of plant this is good it's just a
process<00:03:59.699> of<00:04:00.060> oxidation<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.979> as<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.790> told<00:04:02.849> you

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
process of oxidation so as I told you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.530 
process of oxidation so as I told you
this<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.389> not<00:04:03.509> the<00:04:03.689> only<00:04:03.900> thing<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.229> will<00:04:04.409> use<00:04:04.680> so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
this is not the only thing I will use so

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.800 
this is not the only thing I will use so
what<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.569> will<00:04:06.780> use<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:07.699> is<00:04:08.699> actually<00:04:09.120> cinnamon

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
what I will use now is actually cinnamon

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.110 
what I will use now is actually cinnamon
powder<00:04:10.549> there<00:04:11.549> we<00:04:11.729> go

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
powder there we go

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.539 
powder there we go
and<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.329> will<00:04:12.569> just<00:04:12.750> dip<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.620> stem<00:04:13.979> not<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
and I will just dip the stem not the

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.520 
and I will just dip the stem not the
roots<00:04:14.759> never<00:04:15.120> put<00:04:15.389> cinnamon<00:04:15.599> on<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.289> roots

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
roots never put cinnamon on the roots

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.270 
roots never put cinnamon on the roots
but<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.489> stem<00:04:17.849> I'm<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.419> gonna<00:04:18.599> dip<00:04:18.989> it

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
but just the stem I'm just gonna dip it

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.250 
but just the stem I'm just gonna dip it
to<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> little<00:04:19.820> bit<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.060> cinnamon<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.660> seal<00:04:20.989> off

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
to a little bit of cinnamon to seal off

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.440 
to a little bit of cinnamon to seal off
this<00:04:22.070> wound<00:04:22.400> even<00:04:22.880> better<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.970> hopefully<00:04:25.970> now

I<00:04:26.840> will<00:04:27.620> limit<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.880> appearance<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.570> molds<00:04:30.200> and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
I will limit the appearance of molds and

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.010 
I will limit the appearance of molds and
fungus<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.889> ruts<00:04:31.250> on<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.730> stem<00:04:32.060> hopefully

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
fungus and ruts on the stem hopefully

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.770 
fungus and ruts on the stem hopefully
this<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.530> first<00:04:33.800> time<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.010> do<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.240> see

most other orchids and this is because

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.279 
most other orchids and this is because
their<00:05:48.800> roots<00:05:49.100> will<00:05:49.880> not<00:05:50.150> develop<00:05:50.419> at<00:05:50.720> all<00:05:50.990> in

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
their roots will not develop at all in

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.340 
their roots will not develop at all in
air<00:05:51.710> they<00:05:52.100> will<00:05:52.160> not<00:05:52.460> rot<00:05:53.060> I've<00:05:53.600> never<00:05:54.050> noticed

orchids<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.520> also<00:05:58.910> you<00:05:59.450> could<00:05:59.630> say<00:05:59.810> that<00:05:59.990> this

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
orchids and also you could say that this

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.590 
orchids and also you could say that this
leaf<00:06:00.470> is<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.680> little<00:06:01.010> too<00:06:01.280> low<00:06:01.520> well<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:02.090> have<00:06:02.570> a

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
leaf is a little too low well I have a

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.500 
leaf is a little too low well I have a
wood<00:06:02.960> coming<00:06:03.289> out<00:06:03.530> right<00:06:04.130> above<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:05.090> that

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
wood coming out right above it and that

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.420 
wood coming out right above it and that
wood<00:06:05.750> will<00:06:05.930> not<00:06:05.990> develop<00:06:06.440> if<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.010> don't<00:06:07.280> have

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
wood will not develop if I don't have

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.730 
wood will not develop if I don't have
media<00:06:07.880> around<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.020> think<00:06:09.140> it's<00:06:09.470> good

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
media around it so I think it's good

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.920 
media around it so I think it's good
anyway<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.400> sphagnum<00:06:10.580> Moss<00:06:10.970> is<00:06:11.240> pretty<00:06:11.600> airy

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
anyway the sphagnum Moss is pretty airy

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.400 
anyway the sphagnum Moss is pretty airy
also<00:06:12.770> my<00:06:12.919> pod<00:06:13.130> has<00:06:13.400> side<00:06:13.729> holes<00:06:14.120> it's<00:06:14.510> not<00:06:14.930> too

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
also my pod has side holes it's not too

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.130 
also my pod has side holes it's not too
big<00:06:15.650> so<00:06:15.710> it<00:06:16.340> will<00:06:16.520> not<00:06:16.700> retain<00:06:17.210> too<00:06:17.600> much<00:06:17.840> water

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
big so it will not retain too much water

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.040 
big so it will not retain too much water
and<00:06:18.470> yeah<00:06:19.340> I<00:06:19.400> hope<00:06:19.669> this

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
and yeah I hope this

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.570 
and yeah I hope this
if<00:06:20.110> your<00:06:20.259> pedaling<00:06:20.650> will<00:06:20.830> now<00:06:21.129> develop

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
if your pedaling will now develop

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.360 
if your pedaling will now develop
