00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.369
 Hello 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 Today I want to show you the four 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.070
 pole I'm using in wide time 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.019
 treatment that is to strengthen the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:36.649
 hair that is to help activate more 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:41.360
 the curls year and because in addition to having the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.360
 is also a process of transition 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.180
 my hair is to strengthen and use 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 these from here get in a good result 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.539
 even more than this summer I have is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 very small so my hair 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.940
 had the time that it was detonated and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.390
 bells and they're great 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.770
 This one from skaf 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 she is more and more than five and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.590
 three in one 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 she returns apple trees and strength 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 regenerating and moisturizing wires 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 so I usually use shampoo here together 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:35.030
 with massage and massage creams 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:41.270
 put the children have this from here that is 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.270
 bi-dose keratin and amino acids 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.610
 it accelerates and it's good to see those 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.930
 without key and it is activator of curls 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.850
 he is just for curly hair 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.610
 she is not only a good talker but also a 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.620
 reconstruction and also then you wash 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.240
 hair after I go there and apply it 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.650
 then put on your combing cream 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.780
 So I like this example of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.970
 treatment because they strengthen the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 even more hair to try on 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.260
 transitional period that neither what you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.780
 hair texture is a natural and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.930
 A relaxed one that this one in my 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:41.739
 account in case have a gradual brush 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:45.910
 guanidine paint powder bleaching 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:50.060
 So this chemistry is all she used to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.610
 broken chemical court break then 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.670
 So this does not happen, the good you. 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.310
 use these companies because they contain 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.370
 these vitamins that penetrate the fiber 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.850
 capillary not letting this 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.860
 breakage of the wires or this chemical 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.110
 House 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.230
 the challenge here too because it is very 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:18.799
 good and one-minute skaf is for the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.519
 chestnut bunch wide boxes perfect that 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.519
 he is like that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.980
 and that here you use as follows 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:38.280
 to wash your hair 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:44.090
 in your children, all of them medicines 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.410
 down and wait a minute rinse 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.500
 here is good for that day that you are 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.760
 in a hurry to make a hydration 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.710
 quickly and leave the curls well 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:08.310
 tidy you can read here is a 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:12.840
 only little minute I used to another that is 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.010
 that she is from abel 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:22.220
 I really like her and I wash my hair 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.220
 before moisturizing wash the hair and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.030
 then I put on top of it there 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.090
 put on the thermal cap and rinse the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.090
 hair 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.440
 I really like the result so the 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.200
 ampoule what she does for her hair she 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.240
 besides strengthening and as in the case of this 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:57.919
 da qda ana mascara skaf ead or dose 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:02.730
 she also curses and also takes care of the 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:05.520
 natural part of your hair growing 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.300
 healthy and also the part is in 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.590
 Chemistry is why do not let it happen 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 as I said my chemical cut and 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.410
 show you that my part of the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.410
 curls are not the natural part of the hair 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:38.539
 they look very well treated well 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.539
 really strong 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.840
 so these friends are curly in transition 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.600
 Did you like my tip too ? 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.610
 I recommend it all at the police station. 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.610
 Are you going to like it so sure, kiss it? 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.610
 neighborhood 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.500
 I tried to write but I did not find 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.500
 speak
