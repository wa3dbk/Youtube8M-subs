00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:27.750
 that there is lele I believe well you know how you can 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.780
 easily find your things by holding 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 your clean and tidy room 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.679
 you know that Jehovah keeps everything to his 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.960
 place 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:39.719
 think of the planets are always in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.309
 movement but geova keeps them in the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.870
 their orbits so they never collide 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.929
 also think about how geova did the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.269
 people outside are all different but 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.050
 inside we have the same organs and all 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.050
 in the same position 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.129
 imagine if you had eyes under 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:05.550
 geova feet also keeps the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 animals look at these little fish they are 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.510
 cleaning the hippopotamus also the birds 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510
 lend a hand 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.149
 I would like animals too 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.210
 okay my stuff 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.460
 sometimes I would like it too, but here it is 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.759
 because geova gave you these for 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 take things if you keep it in order 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.920
 geova bedroom will be happy and when 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 you will have put everything in place 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 maybe you'll even find your airplane 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.970
 I could give a good blend let's go outside 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.970
 to play
