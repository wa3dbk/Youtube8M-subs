00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.380
 the hello hello people or if the wing and visa 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 a little more pocket and today I'll talk 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.189
 of cinema giving you kit led and mouth what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 these people had in common all 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 these young actors died 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.420
 tragedy that is a huge commotion in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 people who ran to consume their 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 recent works that preceded 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 their deaths giving her son 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.710
 legend of chile was killed in 1993 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 while recording the movie The Raven 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 the incident occurred during a scene 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 where he would take a shot at the gun that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 should is discharged threw a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 project on your abdomen taking life out of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 actor at the time at age 28 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.590
 the fact made people run 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.840
 to watch the movie 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.840
 some touched by tragedy and others 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 by the death of curiosity and perhaps 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.250
 identify the scene where the actor dies in the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.890
 long scene that was taken from the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.320
 movie that Ledger also had 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 28 years old when on January 22, 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 2008 was found dead in his 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 apartment because of death was 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 prescription drug intoxication 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.790
 had just finished filming a movie 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 dark knight that was released after its 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.840
 death and attracted the attention of many 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.070
 who wished to see their last 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 completed work 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 Walker died on November 30 , 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 2013 at age 40 in a car accident 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.780
 in southern california 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.909
 at the time he was filming the movie fast and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.579
 furious 7 producers were forced to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.710
 completing your scenes using blue 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.900
 the death of olga has generated a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.060
 curiosity so great that the film 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.799
 has recently become the fourth largest 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 box office of all time 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.570
 Now I ask the question why we are 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 so drawn to death because death 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
 of a celebrity we've never seen 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 personally in life generates so much 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 curiosity this kind of curiosity 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.469
 morbid can be seen here in Brazil 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.439
 recently with the singer's death 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.299
 cristiano araujo the press sucked 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.119
 death of the boy until he could no longer 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.670
 turned the pain into a posthumous show but 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.890
 guilt of good tvs if people do not 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.890
 the coverage of their 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 death would not be so extensive they 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 just signed our curiosity 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 curiosity that reached levels 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.800
 extreme to the point of disclosing 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 images of the singer agonizing or very 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.569
 being prepared for the burial 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.940
 This was a lack of respect for a 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.830
 lack of immense character, but not only 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.630
 people who filmed but also those who 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.670
 to publicize the photos on the networks 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.920
 social but back to the question I asked 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.989
 because we have this curiosity 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.120
 I remember when the hit ledger died. 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.709
 I felt a certain identification not only 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.660
 because he played the character of the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.310
 which I liked in the case the joker 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.250
 but because he was the same age as 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.440
 me and him are 79 in the nick of time 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.720
 That thought of ours could have been 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 I think in some cases 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.040
 we end up creating some kind of 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.750
 identification either by age or by 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.790
 form of death for example 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.560
 walker died in a car accident 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.630
 many people have lost relatives and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.150
 friends so that ends up generating a 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.930
 identification they end up living that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.160
 pain and this generates curiosity and empathy 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 I also believe that in the case of 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.840
 celebrities in just consuming their 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.209
 last work in a rampant fashion 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.610
 as a sort of farewell since it does not 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.750
 we will have a next job which is not 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.390
 explain here why some 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.370
 people to go to law and want to see 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.049
 body of someone disfigured thing that the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.420
 internet has to spare if you look 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.610
 I once read that people stop to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.160
 to look at a car accident because they 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.570
 place themselves in the place of the accident 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.820
 that the other person is there and not 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.690
 you give a certain kind of pleasure and 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.910
 conscious 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.680
 Are you there healthy while the other 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.049
 person is there dying 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.959
 or it stops to see for the simple 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.400
 fact that will give repetitive routine of the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.140
 monotonous life in hers 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.360
 I do not particularly like to see 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.880
 accidents in this kind of thing I feel 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.040
 compassion for the suffering of others I think 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.250
 that give in to this kind of curiosity 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.750
 morbid is to cede to the national institute 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.590
 connected to our ancestors who lived 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.450
 in caves 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.640
 I think we've evolved enough to 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.470
 not transform someone's pain 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.930
 show, this is my opinion 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.739
 leaves you comments on your 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.900
 opinion 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.479
 but the explanation of you for this 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.880
 behavior because death attracts so much 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.860
 up until 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.540
 then you already have available notes in the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.320
 social networks we have an account in 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.090
 Facebook 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.130
 You can also get on twitter the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.140
 instagram and to close we have a group 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.030
 open will not see the links of our 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.270
 social networks with is in the description is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.860
 also a www.globo.com site to follow. 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.870
 the cinema comics etc 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.060
 remembering that it is done all the time 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.140
 All right, every moment, at any rate, do not worry. 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.500
 I hope you liked it here. 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.500
 A big hug and see you next Friday.
