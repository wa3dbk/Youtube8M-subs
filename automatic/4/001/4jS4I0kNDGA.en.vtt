the<00:00:36.850> only<00:00:36.969> real<00:00:37.240> trick<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.720> you<00:00:37.810> need<00:00:37.990> to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
the only real trick that you need to

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.110 
the only real trick that you need to
learn<00:00:38.290> before<00:00:38.350> learning<00:00:38.800> an<00:00:39.160> ollie<00:00:39.340> north<00:00:39.460> is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
learn before learning an ollie north is

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.620 
learn before learning an ollie north is
just<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.450> regular<00:00:40.810> ollie<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.910> you<00:00:43.270> should<00:00:43.450> make

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
just a regular ollie but you should make

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.780 
just a regular ollie but you should make
sure<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.380> can<00:00:44.560> suck<00:00:44.890> up<00:00:44.920> your<00:00:45.310> back<00:00:45.460> foot

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
sure that you can suck up your back foot

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.640 
sure that you can suck up your back foot
with<00:00:45.970> your<00:00:46.000> Ollie's<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.600> kind<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.079> bone<00:00:47.440> them

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
with your Ollie's and kind of bone them

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.220 
with your Ollie's and kind of bone them
out<00:00:47.800> almost<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.660> have<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.020> type<00:00:50.200> of

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
out almost if you have the type of

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.229 
out almost if you have the type of
Ollie's<00:00:50.739> where<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.130> can<00:00:51.280> pop<00:00:51.550> off<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.970> ground

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
Ollie's where you can pop off the ground

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.360 
Ollie's where you can pop off the ground
but<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.989> back<00:00:53.200> doesn't<00:00:53.650> necessarily<00:00:54.190> get

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
but the back doesn't necessarily get

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.250 
but the back doesn't necessarily get
sucked<00:00:54.700> up<00:00:54.910> that's<00:00:55.180> a<00:00:55.360> little<00:00:55.540> bit<00:00:55.720> rocketed

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
sucked up that's a little bit rocketed

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.560 
sucked up that's a little bit rocketed
then<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:57.160> may<00:00:57.310> need<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.700> learn<00:00:57.940> how<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.270> push

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
then you may need to learn how to push

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.660 
then you may need to learn how to push
your<00:00:58.600> front<00:00:58.989> foot<00:00:59.230> forward<00:00:59.649> to<00:01:00.100> level<00:01:00.399> up<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
your front foot forward to level up the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.840 
your front foot forward to level up the
board<00:01:00.910> first<00:01:01.120> before<00:01:01.510> learning<00:01:02.050> this<00:01:02.140> trick

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
board first before learning this trick

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.730 
board first before learning this trick
you<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.360> by<00:01:04.570> practicing<00:01:05.199> sliding

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
you can do this by practicing sliding

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.800 
you can do this by practicing sliding
your<00:01:05.860> front<00:01:06.009> foot<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.670> nose<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.149> actually

your front foot to the nose and actually

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.510 
your front foot to the nose and actually
pushing<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.320> forward<00:01:08.649> in<00:01:08.829> front<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.249> a<00:01:09.280> few

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
pushing it forward in front of you a few

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.779 
pushing it forward in front of you a few
times<00:01:10.469> for<00:01:11.469> help<00:01:11.649> with<00:01:11.829> that<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.189> can<00:01:12.429> go<00:01:12.609> back

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
times for help with that you can go back

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.569 
times for help with that you can go back
and<00:01:12.939> watch<00:01:13.119> my<00:01:13.359> how<00:01:13.539> to<00:01:13.600> ollie<00:01:13.960> video<00:01:14.579> another

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
and watch my how to ollie video another

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.129 
and watch my how to ollie video another
trick<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:15.999> could<00:01:16.329> help<00:01:16.479> with<00:01:16.630> learning<00:01:17.049> in

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
trick that could help with learning in

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.039 
trick that could help with learning in
all<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.380> north<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.859> a<00:01:18.249> kickflip<00:01:18.939> just<00:01:19.749> because

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
all the north is a kickflip just because

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.169 
all the north is a kickflip just because
that<00:01:20.259> motion<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.859> your<00:01:20.920> foot<00:01:21.280> coming<00:01:21.700> up<00:01:21.909> and

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
that motion of your foot coming up and

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.539 
that motion of your foot coming up and
off<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.450> board<00:01:22.929> is<00:01:23.409> similar<00:01:23.859> to<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> kickflip

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
off the board is similar to a kickflip

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.620 
off the board is similar to a kickflip
they're<00:01:24.909> just<00:01:25.149> going<00:01:25.329> in<00:01:25.539> different

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
they're just going in different

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.870 
they're just going in different
directions

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.789 

so<00:01:31.479> there<00:01:31.659> are<00:01:31.780> three<00:01:32.020> main<00:01:32.170> parts<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.710> an

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
so there are three main parts to an

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.929 
so there are three main parts to an
ollie<00:01:32.979> north<00:01:33.990> there's<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.229> pop<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.520> sliding

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
ollie north there's the pop the sliding

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.420 
ollie north there's the pop the sliding
your<00:01:37.060> foot<00:01:37.240> up<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.780> off<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.110> nose<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.680> the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
your foot up and off the nose and the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.760 
your foot up and off the nose and the
landing<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.780> foot<00:01:43.990> positioning<00:01:44.440> for<00:01:44.619> this

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
landing the foot positioning for this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.639 
landing the foot positioning for this
trick<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.250> exactly<00:01:45.880> like<00:01:46.090> an<00:01:46.240> ollie<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.840> want

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
trick is exactly like an ollie you want

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.139 
trick is exactly like an ollie you want
to<00:01:47.710> make<00:01:47.830> sure<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.159> your<00:01:48.280> front<00:01:48.580> foot<00:01:48.790> isn't

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
to make sure that your front foot isn't

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.420 
to make sure that your front foot isn't
too<00:01:49.509> far<00:01:49.750> off<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> heel<00:01:50.500> or<00:01:50.710> toe<00:01:50.740> side<00:01:51.190> and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
too far off to the heel or toe side and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.840 
too far off to the heel or toe side and
put<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.000> basically<00:01:52.509> directly<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> middle

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
put it basically directly in the middle

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.249 
put it basically directly in the middle
you<00:01:54.850> also<00:01:55.030> may<00:01:55.299> want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.539> try<00:01:55.750> moving<00:01:56.049> your

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
you also may want to try moving your

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.080 
you also may want to try moving your
front<00:01:56.530> foot<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.190> closer<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> nose

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
front foot a little closer to the nose

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.149 
front foot a little closer to the nose
of<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.390> board<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:59.560> way<00:01:59.710> when<00:01:59.860> you<00:01:59.950> go<00:02:00.100> to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
of the board that way when you go to

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.889 
of the board that way when you go to
slide<00:02:00.549> your<00:02:00.789> foot<00:02:00.940> up<00:02:01.149> there<00:02:01.539> won't<00:02:01.690> be<00:02:01.780> as

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
slide your foot up there won't be as

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.719 
slide your foot up there won't be as
much<00:02:02.080> distance<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.830> clear<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.280> order<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.550> get

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
much distance to clear in order to get

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.899 
much distance to clear in order to get
off<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.240> nose<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.720> board<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:06.310> goal<00:02:06.520> here

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
off the nose of the board your goal here

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.370 
off the nose of the board your goal here
is<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.270> make<00:02:07.450> sure<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.659> your<00:02:07.929> foot<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
is to make sure that your foot is

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.380 
is to make sure that your foot is
basically<00:02:08.890> completely<00:02:09.489> perpendicular<00:02:10.360> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
basically completely perpendicular to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.690 
basically completely perpendicular to
the<00:02:10.630> board<00:02:10.869> once<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.739> slide<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.130> off<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.310> note

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the board once you slide it off the note

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.090 
the board once you slide it off the note
if<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.810> too<00:02:14.019> far<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> heel<00:02:14.739> or<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:14.980> toe

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
if it's too far to the heel or the toe

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.830 
if it's too far to the heel or the toe
side<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.239> end<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.780> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
side you're just going to end up with a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.430 
side you're just going to end up with a
kickflip<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:17.650> heel<00:02:17.920> flip<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.780> yes<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.230> foot

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
kickflip or heel flip so yes your foot

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.350 
kickflip or heel flip so yes your foot
is<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.800> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.160> up<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.670> off<00:02:21.850> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
is just going to go up and off and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.900 
is just going to go up and off and
forward<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.080> front<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> board<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
forward in front of the board so to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.509 
forward in front of the board so to
begin<00:02:28.120> practicing<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:29.709> do<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.830> few<00:02:30.100> Ollie's

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
begin practicing just do a few Ollie's

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.449 
begin practicing just do a few Ollie's
and<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:31.360> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.780> warmed<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.280> said

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
and get kind of warmed up like I said

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.610 
and get kind of warmed up like I said
before<00:02:33.640> make<00:02:34.420> sure<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.110> slide<00:02:35.590> your

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
before make sure that you can slide your

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.380 
before make sure that you can slide your
foot<00:02:36.010> forward<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.519> bring<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.970> back<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.329> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
foot forward to bring up the back of the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.990 
foot forward to bring up the back of the
board

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.309 

also<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> might<00:02:42.360> want<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.569> try<00:02:42.720> doing<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.140> few

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
also you might want to try doing a few

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.170 
also you might want to try doing a few
Ali's<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.129> weight<00:02:44.310> landing<00:02:44.939> a<00:02:44.970> little

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
Ali's with your weight landing a little

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.089 
Ali's with your weight landing a little
bit<00:02:45.420> towards<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> nose<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.709> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> do

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
bit towards the nose what you want to do

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.369 
bit towards the nose what you want to do
is<00:02:50.370> basically<00:02:50.549> little<00:02:51.510> by<00:02:51.689> little<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.290> want

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
is basically little by little you want

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.229 
is basically little by little you want
to<00:02:52.530> push<00:02:52.769> your<00:02:52.950> front<00:02:53.250> foot<00:02:53.489> further<00:02:53.939> and

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
to push your front foot further and

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.759 
to push your front foot further and
further<00:02:54.480> towards<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.230> nose<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> board

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
further towards the nose of the board

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.030 
further towards the nose of the board
until<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:56.579> actually<00:02:56.760> getting<00:02:57.239> off<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.689> edge

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
until it's actually getting off the edge

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
until it's actually getting off the edge
don't<00:02:59.040> try<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.700> full<00:02:59.909> leg<00:03:00.239> extension<00:03:00.269> at

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
don't try for the full leg extension at

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.599 
don't try for the full leg extension at
first<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.859> just<00:03:02.010> want<00:03:02.189> to<00:03:02.280> start<00:03:02.489> getting

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
first you just want to start getting

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.369 
first you just want to start getting
comfortable<00:03:03.120> pushing<00:03:03.540> your<00:03:03.810> foot<00:03:04.049> towards

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
comfortable pushing your foot towards

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.710 
comfortable pushing your foot towards
the<00:03:04.650> nose<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.069> board<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:06.269> may<00:03:06.420> end<00:03:06.599> up

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the nose of the board you may end up

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
the nose of the board you may end up
with<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:07.140> weird-looking<00:03:07.500> always<00:03:08.189> kind<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
with some weird-looking always kind of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.009 
with some weird-looking always kind of
like<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.299> one<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:15.629> tricks

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
like this this is one of those tricks

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.170 
like this this is one of those tricks
that<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.319> think<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.769> easier<00:03:17.129> moving<00:03:17.609> because

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
that I think is easier moving because

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.210 
that I think is easier moving because
the<00:03:18.480> board<00:03:18.720> kind<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.079> goes<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.889> you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the board kind of goes with you as you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.629 
the board kind of goes with you as you
have<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> momentum<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.260> would<00:03:22.500> say<00:03:22.769> try

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
have the momentum so I would say try

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.449 
have the momentum so I would say try
this<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.879> few<00:03:24.000> times<00:03:24.180> roll<00:03:25.099> try<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.250> do<00:03:26.340> an

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
this a few times roll try and do an

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:26.929 
this a few times roll try and do an
ollie

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
ollie

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.670 
ollie
but<00:03:27.269> kick<00:03:27.599> your<00:03:27.750> front<00:03:27.989> foot<00:03:28.170> off<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.500> board

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
but kick your front foot off the board

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.559 
but kick your front foot off the board
and<00:03:29.010> don't<00:03:29.579> even<00:03:29.670> worry<00:03:29.819> about<00:03:30.030> landing<00:03:30.329> you

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
and don't even worry about landing you

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.110 
and don't even worry about landing you
just<00:03:31.530> push<00:03:31.739> your<00:03:31.889> front<00:03:32.099> foot<00:03:32.310> off<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.819> let

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
just push your front foot off and let

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.809 
just push your front foot off and let
your<00:03:33.269> back<00:03:33.450> foot<00:03:33.780> land<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.230> board<00:03:34.819> this

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
your back foot land on the board this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.520 
your back foot land on the board this
should<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.389> more<00:03:36.599> used<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.139> awkward

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
should get you more used to the awkward

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.199 
should get you more used to the awkward
feeling<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.099> pushing<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:38.670> foot<00:03:38.909> off<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
feeling of pushing your foot off the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.819 
feeling of pushing your foot off the
board<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.750> midair<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.290> also<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.799> of

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
board in midair this is also one of

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.650 
board in midair this is also one of
those<00:03:43.980> tricks<00:03:44.340> where<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.669> highly<00:03:45.180> recommend

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
those tricks where I highly recommend

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.059 
those tricks where I highly recommend
that<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> hold<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.590> something<00:03:46.799> while

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that you hold on to something while

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.099 
that you hold on to something while
learning<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:48.359> will<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.660> make<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.989> lot

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
learning it it will just make it a lot

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.720 
learning it it will just make it a lot
easier<00:03:49.319> if<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.799> can<00:03:49.949> hold<00:03:50.220> your<00:03:50.370> weight<00:03:50.549> up

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
easier if you can hold your weight up

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.409 
easier if you can hold your weight up
off<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.090> board<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:55.909> also<00:03:56.909> just<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.209> case

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
off the board and also just in case

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.979 
off the board and also just in case
anything<00:03:57.720> goes<00:03:58.049> wrong<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.560> won't<00:03:58.680> fall<00:03:59.099> down

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
anything goes wrong you won't fall down

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.020 
anything goes wrong you won't fall down
so<00:04:00.989> basically<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> goal<00:04:01.739> here<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.760> when

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
so basically the goal here is that when

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.939 
so basically the goal here is that when
you<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.269> an<00:04:03.389> ollie<00:04:03.629> your<00:04:04.260> front<00:04:04.530> foot<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.739> going

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
you do an ollie your front foot is going

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.309 
you do an ollie your front foot is going
to<00:04:05.010> slide<00:04:05.370> up<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.669> nose<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.569> once<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.900> pushes

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
to slide up the nose but once it pushes

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.259 
to slide up the nose but once it pushes
off<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.650> edge<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:08.280> going<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.489> push<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.090> nose

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
off the edge it's going to push the nose

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.180 
off the edge it's going to push the nose
of<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.629> board<00:04:09.810> downward<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.949> got<00:04:11.099> to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
of the board downward and you got to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.770 
of the board downward and you got to
make<00:04:11.310> sure<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.549> can<00:04:11.699> suck<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.120> your<00:04:12.150> back<00:04:12.419> foot

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
make sure you can suck up your back foot

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.319 
make sure you can suck up your back foot
and<00:04:13.250> instead<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.519> an<00:04:14.639> ollie<00:04:14.879> where<00:04:15.239> you

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
and instead of like an ollie where you

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.149 
and instead of like an ollie where you
keep<00:04:15.569> your<00:04:15.599> front<00:04:15.930> foot<00:04:16.169> pushed<00:04:16.560> down<00:04:16.799> onto

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
keep your front foot pushed down onto

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.949 
keep your front foot pushed down onto
the<00:04:17.250> board<00:04:17.430> I'm<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.269> kick<00:04:18.449> it<00:04:18.570> straight

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the board I'm going to kick it straight

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.719 
the board I'm going to kick it straight
forward<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:19.349> front<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.250> nose<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.669> the

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
forward in front of all the nose of the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.960 
forward in front of all the nose of the
board<00:04:20.880> dips<00:04:21.180> down<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:23.010> may<00:04:23.220> end<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.550> with<00:04:23.760> some

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
board dips down you may end up with some

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.610 
board dips down you may end up with some
funny<00:04:24.210> looking<00:04:24.449> ones<00:04:24.750> where<00:04:25.020> your<00:04:25.139> front<00:04:25.440> foot

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
funny looking ones where your front foot

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.950 
funny looking ones where your front foot
doesn't<00:04:25.860> come<00:04:26.130> too<00:04:26.370> far<00:04:26.610> off<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.909> board<00:04:27.150> but

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
doesn't come too far off the board but

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.779 
doesn't come too far off the board but
like<00:04:28.199> I<00:04:28.320> said<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.860> work<00:04:29.039> on<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> extension

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
like I said you work on the extension

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.550 
like I said you work on the extension
later<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.300> won't<00:04:30.479> get<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> main<00:04:30.930> feeling<00:04:31.289> of

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
later you won't get the main feeling of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.230 
later you won't get the main feeling of
it<00:04:31.680> down

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.590 

as<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:37.310> get<00:04:37.490> more<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:37.700> more<00:04:37.820> comfortable<00:04:38.180> you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
as you get more and more comfortable you

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.090 
as you get more and more comfortable you
can<00:04:38.630> start<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.170> try<00:04:39.380> pushing<00:04:39.680> your<00:04:39.920> foot

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
can start to try pushing your foot

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:54.130 
can start to try pushing your foot
further<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.730> further<00:04:40.910> out<00:04:52.450> also<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:53.960> don't

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
further and further out also you don't

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.660 
further and further out also you don't
necessarily<00:04:54.260> have<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:54.950> be<00:04:55.220> able<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.430> ollie

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
necessarily have to be able to ollie

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.120 
necessarily have to be able to ollie
very<00:04:56.120> high<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.450> do<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:56.810> trick<00:04:57.170> just<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.950> nice

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
very high to do this trick just a nice

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640 
very high to do this trick just a nice
mid-sized<00:04:58.820> ollie<00:04:59.180> as<00:04:59.900> long<00:05:00.050> as<00:05:00.170> your<00:05:00.290> feet<00:05:00.500> are

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
mid-sized ollie as long as your feet are

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.590 
mid-sized ollie as long as your feet are
fast<00:05:00.920> enough<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.460> kick<00:05:01.700> forward<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.270> get<00:05:02.390> back

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
fast enough to kick forward and get back

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.230 
fast enough to kick forward and get back
to<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> board<00:05:03.080> then<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.410> should<00:05:03.650> be<00:05:03.770> fine

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
to the board then you should be fine

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.670 
to the board then you should be fine
this<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.420> one<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.600> those<00:05:05.720> tricks<00:05:06.050> where<00:05:06.320> there

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
this is one of those tricks where there

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.930 
this is one of those tricks where there
will<00:05:06.830> be<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:07.010> lot<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.220> trial<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.790> error

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
will be a lot of trial and error

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.060 
will be a lot of trial and error
especially<00:05:08.720> accidentally<00:05:09.590> flipping<00:05:09.980> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
especially accidentally flipping the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.890 
especially accidentally flipping the
board<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.580> you're<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.940> other<00:05:10.970> we're<00:05:11.780> not

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
board and you're the other we're not

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.510 
board and you're the other we're not
getting<00:05:12.200> your<00:05:12.290> foot<00:05:12.560> right<00:05:12.860> off<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.310> end<00:05:13.430> of

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
getting your foot right off the end of

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.790 
getting your foot right off the end of
the<00:05:13.580> nose<00:05:13.760> but<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:15.080> once<00:05:15.290> you<00:05:15.440> kick<00:05:15.680> your

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
the nose but I think once you kick your

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.220 
the nose but I think once you kick your
foot<00:05:16.040> off<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.190> nose<00:05:16.520> just<00:05:16.880> once<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.720> feel

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
foot off the nose just once and you feel

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.080 
foot off the nose just once and you feel
what's<00:05:18.530> supposed<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.890> actually<00:05:19.070> happen<00:05:19.430> it

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
what's supposed to actually happen it

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.730 
what's supposed to actually happen it
kind<00:05:20.300> of<00:05:20.360> clicks<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.110> should<00:05:21.350> be<00:05:21.470> able<00:05:21.560> to

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
kind of clicks and you should be able to

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.010 
kind of clicks and you should be able to
start<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.220> hone<00:05:22.430> it<00:05:22.610> better<00:05:22.790> so<00:05:23.420> you<00:05:23.510> can<00:05:23.810> get

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
start to hone it better so you can get

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.860 
start to hone it better so you can get
the<00:05:24.140> full<00:05:24.350> extension<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.160> proper<00:05:25.760> ollie<00:05:26.000> so

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
the full extension and proper ollie so

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.200 
the full extension and proper ollie so
here<00:05:27.230> are<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.350> few<00:05:27.410> Holley<00:05:27.770> North's<00:05:28.220> just

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
here are a few Holley North's just

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.420 
here are a few Holley North's just
mainly<00:05:29.420> focus<00:05:29.930> on<00:05:30.050> my<00:05:30.200> front<00:05:30.470> foot<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.070> notice

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
mainly focus on my front foot and notice

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.340 
mainly focus on my front foot and notice
how<00:05:31.610> when<00:05:31.970> it's<00:05:32.090> coming<00:05:32.450> up<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.840> off<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:32.960> end

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
how when it's coming up and off the end

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.140 
how when it's coming up and off the end
of<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.470> board<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:34.370> pushing<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.970> nose

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
of the board it's pushing the nose

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.120 
of the board it's pushing the nose
downward<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:35.870> that's<00:05:36.260> making<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.740> back<00:05:36.950> of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
downward and that's making the back of

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.340 
downward and that's making the back of
the<00:05:37.220> board<00:05:37.370> lift<00:05:37.670> up<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.120> my<00:05:38.840> foot<00:05:39.170> goes

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
the board lift up and my foot goes

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.380 
the board lift up and my foot goes
