I<00:00:13.120> wanted<00:00:14.120> to<00:00:14.210> talk<00:00:14.480> about<00:00:14.510> a<00:00:15.730> cure<00:00:16.730> for

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.220 
I wanted to talk about a cure for
disease<00:00:17.510> I<00:00:17.869> received<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:19.270> answer<00:00:20.270> by<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.510> dream

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.740 

this<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:24.470> prophetic<00:00:24.920> dream<00:00:26.770> if<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:28.789> only

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
this is a prophetic dream if I only

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.770 
this is a prophetic dream if I only
managed<00:00:30.200> it<00:00:30.350> -<00:00:31.239> so<00:00:32.239> you<00:00:32.300> understand<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:35.600> this

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
managed it - so you understand that this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.920 
managed it - so you understand that this
is<00:00:35.840> not<00:00:36.230> really<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:36.949> in<00:00:37.879> left<00:00:38.239> field<00:00:38.480> as<00:00:38.809> you

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
is not really so in left field as you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.729 
is not really so in left field as you
might<00:00:39.140> think

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
might think

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.320 
might think
I<00:00:41.680> think<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:43.190> lupus<00:00:43.640> is<00:00:43.820> caused<00:00:44.589> by<00:00:45.589> your

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
I think that lupus is caused by your

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.020 
I think that lupus is caused by your
intestinal<00:00:47.330> tract<00:00:47.629> being<00:00:48.379> impacted<00:00:49.220> with

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
intestinal tract being impacted with

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.310 
intestinal tract being impacted with
feces<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.870> will<00:00:52.000> put<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.360> link<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:53.870> have<00:00:53.900> put

things<00:01:02.150> here<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:03.280> talked<00:01:04.280> about<00:01:04.309> how<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:04.940> fast

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
things here I talked about how to fast

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.960 
things here I talked about how to fast
and<00:01:06.370> as<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.490> clean-out<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.590> -<00:01:09.790> for<00:01:10.790> other

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
and as a clean-out and - for other

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
and as a clean-out and - for other
different<00:01:11.420> things<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:14.240> will<00:01:14.450> work<00:01:14.479> I

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
different things and that will work I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.790 
different things and that will work I
think<00:01:15.049> over<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.040> long<00:01:16.370> period<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:16.970> time<00:01:17.620> if<00:01:18.620> you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
think over a long period of time if you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.880 
think over a long period of time if you
read<00:01:18.980> some<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> books<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:19.880> fasting<00:01:20.890> bus

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
read some of the books on fasting bus

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.620 
read some of the books on fasting bus
guy<00:01:22.160> named<00:01:22.460> Earhart<00:01:24.190> who<00:01:25.190> was<00:01:25.940> really<00:01:26.180> into

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
guy named Earhart who was really into

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.910 
guy named Earhart who was really into
fasting<00:01:28.360> after<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.390> long<00:01:29.720> period<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.320> fasting

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
fasting after a long period of fasting

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.080 
fasting after a long period of fasting
he<00:01:31.340> actually<00:01:32.060> extruded<00:01:32.900> some<00:01:33.170> mercury<00:01:34.090> his

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
he actually extruded some mercury his

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.390 
he actually extruded some mercury his
mother<00:01:35.390> had<00:01:35.570> given<00:01:35.750> him<00:01:36.050> into<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.410> potion<00:01:36.980> when

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
mother had given him into a potion when

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.240 
mother had given him into a potion when
he<00:01:37.490> was<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> young<00:01:37.970> child<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.680> takes<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.070> while

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
he was a young child so it takes a while

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.750 
he was a young child so it takes a while
for<00:01:40.310> fasting<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.180> work<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:42.370> think<00:01:43.370> that<00:01:43.580> it's

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
for fasting to work I think that it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.440 
for fasting to work I think that it's
easier<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> see<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:47.590> major<00:01:48.590> improvement<00:01:49.580> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
easier to see a major improvement and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.130 
easier to see a major improvement and
your<00:01:51.080> condition<00:01:51.560> from<00:01:51.710> lupus<00:01:52.070> if<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.430> go<00:01:52.640> get

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
your condition from lupus if you go get

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.020 
your condition from lupus if you go get
a<00:01:58.480> colon<00:01:59.480> clean<00:01:59.780> out<00:02:00.020> did<00:02:00.710> they<00:02:00.860> do

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
a colon clean out did they do

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.100 
a colon clean out did they do
mechanically<00:02:02.030> with<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.270> water<00:02:02.750> irrigation

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
mechanically with a water irrigation

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.050 
mechanically with a water irrigation
there<00:02:03.800> are<00:02:03.920> some<00:02:04.190> people<00:02:04.580> there's<00:02:04.760> even

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
there are some people there's even

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.320 
there are some people there's even
people<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:05.570> certified<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:07.040> this<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
people that are certified to do this and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.430 
people that are certified to do this and
it's<00:02:09.289> not<00:02:09.739> expensive<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:11.269> go<00:02:11.720> one<00:02:12.080> or<00:02:12.260> two

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
it's not expensive to go one or two

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's not expensive to go one or two
times<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:13.459> see<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:14.000> has<00:02:14.180> an<00:02:14.420> effect<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.430> this

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
times to see if it has an effect so this

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.090 
times to see if it has an effect so this
is<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> science<00:02:17.959> experiment

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
