00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.990
 good meeting with daniela that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.080
 we come to search because he is already in charge 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.850
 raise and take care of a lot of animals 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.410
 but that are not so easy to find 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.300
 it's not something that everyone has in their 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.490
 house then we come to look for 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.830
 tell us a little bit more when 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.840
 daniela from business, good, I've 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.370
 seen that I was saying be present 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.129
 that you have a lot of animals to your 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.379
 good charge we want to know what are 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.980
 those little animals good of animals 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.510
 we are talking about eight pythons wings 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.790
 now you already imagine a duck said 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.510
 animal that were eight painters them 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.780
 they are exotic animals I say I do not believe 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.309
 I sell simply they are our 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.949
 because they are half with my godfather 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.550
 I explain for we have eight pythons where 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.920
 the tenés are in a room that is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 specially prepared for them each 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.340
 which in your terrarium because it is not 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.010
 will grow or anything like that is called 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 terrarium the place where the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.590
 Pythons are animals are builders 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 they are called the hunt by difference of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.000
 temperature and smell are animals that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.550
 hardly hear and not 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.620
 in the infrared why of some 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.590
 way they capture the heat actually 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.590
 when they put out the language is that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.720
 they are feeling the smell and the skin more 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.350
 or less touch also to see that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.420
 here to what kind of animal 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.070
 or non-animal person because in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.170
 reality is the people for not to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.760
 they are like a tree, you are like a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.550
 tree for them they are 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.950
 used to moving on top of you like 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.450
 if nothing is there a care that we 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.030
 We were seeing when when we entered 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.880
 the room where you have the Viper 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.790
 snakes that there is like a temperature 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.990
 high destiny 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.050
 microclimate and inside that yourselves 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.229
 they are given exactly life 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.369
 because they are not animals that are 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.230
 originating from america but they are from 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.510
 South Africa 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.599
 and are used to not heat 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.670
 extreme but neither to the extreme cold 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.190
 it has to have a temperature on 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.459
 animal has to be careful 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.370
 always supervised by veterinarians or 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.860
 either by a veterinarian who comes yes or yes 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.220
 minimum once a month to control them to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220
 everyone 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.400
 now that we also see as an aquarium 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.090
 and some fish 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.319
 a few tender that there is this 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.000
 idea of ​​eating a particular way 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.680
 tell us a little bit about this too is 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.050
 well these that are here back are 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.900
 carps coi are the original fish of 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.480
 Japan that is fed with 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.080
 mamadera you really know the bottles there 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.940
 floating there are there 30 tents with more or 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.709
 least I see turtles here too 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.630
 we are seeing some cakes and some 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.430
 pretty big to have counted and also 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.230
 that is the subject of torture in that 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.540
 there you have two land turtles that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.360
 they are much more than 10 years old 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 I do not know how many are always more than 10 without 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.340
 safe 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.920
 manuela and clot there clota in the name 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.130
 what they put are the two that you have there 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.380
 what I love about them is how fast 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.610
 that walk when you put them on the floor 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.890
 not on earth but it is believed that the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.730
 Turtle is so cute but it's not a myth 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.060
 it is this 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.190
 put them a shoe and you will see how 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.319
 run for the shoe include and then 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.579
 also here we are seeing a turkey 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.829
 It is a beauty with a violet blue tone 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.889
 spectacular also how it came 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.189
 here we bought them in a good 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.019
 hatchery also brings them jump if 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.269
 I'm not wrong, they already have a few 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.180
 years should also have as four 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.709
 or five years that is the house you have app 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.469
 already looked the pp someone is tied and good and 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.870
 there they are looking is with their daddy who 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.349
 he had a stick and is away from pepe 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.120
 in this part it is re baby and pity that 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:24.380
 they came just when his tail fell 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.380

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.470
