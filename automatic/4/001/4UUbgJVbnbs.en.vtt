about four inches off yeah so let's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.479 
about four inches off yeah so let's
measure<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:47.969> long<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.860 

I'm<00:00:53.489> putting<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> measuring<00:00:54.300> tape<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.780> at

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I'm putting the measuring tape here at

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'm putting the measuring tape here at
the<00:00:54.930> top<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.410> crown<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> good

the top on my crown you get a good

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
the top on my crown you get a good
measure<00:00:58.129> it's<00:00:59.129> been<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> minute<00:00:59.609> since<00:00:59.640> I've

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
measure it's been a minute since I've

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:17.690 
measure it's been a minute since I've
measured<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.300> hair<00:01:01.520> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080 

so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.630> he's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:20.090> 24

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
year so I'm trying to minimize the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
year so I'm trying to minimize the
amount<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.580> heat<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.060> put<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.539> hair<00:01:58.130> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
amount of heat that I put on my hair and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.820 
amount of heat that I put on my hair and
when<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> shaved<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.759> hair<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.319> spirals

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
when I shaved my hair I put the spirals

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.570 
when I shaved my hair I put the spirals
in<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.280> hair<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.819> bantu<00:02:03.209> knot<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.580> because

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
in my hair from a bantu knot and because

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.130 
in my hair from a bantu knot and because
it's<00:02:05.729> easy<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> maintain

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it's easy to maintain

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's easy to maintain
then<00:02:07.350> having<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:07.950> hair<00:02:08.160> completely<00:02:08.810> straight

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
then having my hair completely straight

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
then having my hair completely straight
straight<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.190> love<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.549> hair

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
straight because if I love my hair

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.910 
straight because if I love my hair
straight<00:02:12.030> straight<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.690> would<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.709> to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
straight straight I would have to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
straight straight I would have to
constantly<00:02:14.549> put<00:02:14.730> heat<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.209> every<00:02:15.510> day<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
constantly put heat on it every day to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.490 
constantly put heat on it every day to
actually<00:02:16.260> maintain<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:17.459> straightness<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually maintain the straightness so I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.530 
actually maintain the straightness so I
started<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.609> spirals<00:02:24.120> because

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
started I like to do the spirals because

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.069 
started I like to do the spirals because
it's<00:02:24.690> easy<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.049> maintain<00:02:26.420> if<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.690> humid

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
it's easy to maintain if it's humid

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.530 
it's easy to maintain if it's humid
outside<00:02:28.260> all<00:02:28.859> I<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.940> try<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.209> keep<00:02:30.480> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
outside all I do is to try to keep it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.890 
outside all I do is to try to keep it
from<00:02:30.750> being<00:02:30.989> really<00:02:31.530> frizzy<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.900> actually

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
from being really frizzy I actually

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590 
from being really frizzy I actually
twist<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:35.040> take<00:02:35.549> my<00:02:35.730> fingers<00:02:36.359> in<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
twist it up I take my fingers in that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.620 
twist it up I take my fingers in that
kind<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.900> toilet<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.359> I<00:02:39.359> do<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
kind of toilet just like so and I do it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.720 
kind of toilet just like so and I do it
to<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.470> ends<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> hair<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.700> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to all the the ends of the hair so it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.420 
to all the the ends of the hair so it
prevents<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.840> hair<00:02:43.019> from<00:02:43.109> being<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.680> poofy

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
prevents my hair from being really poofy

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.590 
prevents my hair from being really poofy
if<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.299> really<00:02:45.720> humid<00:02:46.620> outside<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.459> then<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
if it's really humid outside and then of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.599 
if it's really humid outside and then of
course<00:02:48.840> when<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.500> home<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.920> get
