00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
blisters hurt really bad and you know of

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
blisters hurt really bad and you know of
course<00:02:00.760> like<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.090> said<00:02:01.240> if<00:02:01.330> anything<00:02:01.570> what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
course like I said if anything what

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.360 
course like I said if anything what
touched<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.200> was<00:02:02.320> just<00:02:02.440> terrible<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:02.830> I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
touched it it was just terrible so I

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.100 
touched it it was just terrible so I
think<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> worst<00:02:04.240> part<00:02:04.420> was<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.540> blisters<00:02:04.930> I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
think the worst part was the blisters I

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.690 
think the worst part was the blisters I
didn't<00:02:05.320> think<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> would<00:02:06.190> be<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.370> didn't

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
didn't think that it would be I didn't

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.770 
didn't think that it would be I didn't
think<00:02:06.760> their<00:02:06.910> program<00:02:07.180> would<00:02:07.300> be<00:02:07.330> as<00:02:07.540> bad

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
think their program would be as bad

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.600 
think their program would be as bad
because<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.229> was<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> sunburn<00:02:09.040> but<00:02:09.340> my

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
because it was like a sunburn but my

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.690 
because it was like a sunburn but my
skin<00:02:09.820> blistered<00:02:10.180> up<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.360> lot<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
skin blistered up a lot and all the the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.150 
skin blistered up a lot and all the the
blisters<00:02:13.060> started<00:02:13.450> succeeding<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.440> quite

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
far like I said the the actual recovery

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.370 
far like I said the the actual recovery
process<00:04:52.180> was<00:04:52.210> difficult<00:04:52.539> for<00:04:52.900> me<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.320> I'm

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
process was difficult for me and I'm

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.080 
process was difficult for me and I'm
hoping<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.889> maybe<00:04:54.400> obviously<00:04:54.729> get<00:04:54.820> used<00:04:54.970> to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
hoping that maybe obviously get used to

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.980 
hoping that maybe obviously get used to
it<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.210> second<00:04:55.450> time<00:04:55.570> around<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.840> maybe

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
it the second time around and maybe

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.480 
it the second time around and maybe
won't<00:04:56.080> be<00:04:56.169> as<00:04:56.380> bad<00:04:56.620> a<00:04:56.680> second<00:04:56.950> time<00:04:57.070> around<00:04:57.220> but

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
won't be as bad a second time around but

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.170 
won't be as bad a second time around but
the<00:04:58.270> recovery<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.200> took<00:04:59.410> me<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.590> good<00:05:00.030> six<00:05:01.030> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
the recovery it took me a good six to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.580 
the recovery it took me a good six to
seven<00:05:01.450> days<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.630> feel<00:05:02.020> like<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.289> could<00:05:02.470> like

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
seven days to feel like that could like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.719 
seven days to feel like that could like

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.820 
but my procedure is September the 5th so
that<00:05:18.700> will<00:05:18.820> be<00:05:18.940> what<00:05:19.870> exactly<00:05:20.289> a<00:05:20.320> month<00:05:20.530> from

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830

that will be what exactly a month from
the<00:05:20.979> first<00:05:21.190> one<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:21.639> I<00:05:22.479> don't<00:05:23.169> know<00:05:23.410> if<00:05:23.560> that's

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
the first one so I don't know if that's

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.260 
the first one so I don't know if that's
standard<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.700> don't<00:05:24.849> know<00:05:24.910> maybe<00:05:25.090> they're

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
standard I don't know maybe they're

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.120 
standard I don't know maybe they're
thinking<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.960> they<00:05:26.200> told<00:05:26.590> me<00:05:26.680> too<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:26.950> if<00:05:27.039> it

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
thinking the next time there cuz I've

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.129 
thinking the next time there cuz I've
seen<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.940> few<00:05:31.060> of<00:05:31.120> these<00:05:31.240> on<00:05:31.419> YouTube<00:05:31.840> there's

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
seen a few of these on YouTube there's

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.150 
seen a few of these on YouTube there's
not<00:05:32.229> really<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.410> lot<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.560> tension<00:05:32.800> removal

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
not really a lot of tension removal

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.890 
not really a lot of tension removal
things<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.580> I've<00:05:33.760> seen<00:05:33.940> where<00:05:34.120> my<00:05:34.570> approves

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
things but I've seen where my approves

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.300 
things but I've seen where my approves
the<00:05:35.050> first<00:05:35.229> time<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.500> I've<00:05:35.590> got<00:05:35.740> as<00:05:35.919> deep<00:05:36.190> as

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
the first time that I've got as deep as

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.980 
the first time that I've got as deep as
it<00:05:36.400> could<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:36.880> maybe<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:37.300> heal<00:05:37.450> faster<00:05:37.810> and

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
it could so maybe it can heal faster and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.659 
it could so maybe it can heal faster and
the<00:05:38.440> second<00:05:38.740> time<00:05:38.919> is<00:05:39.099> when<00:05:39.190> they<00:05:39.280> really<00:05:39.580> you

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
the second time is when they really you

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.610 
the second time is when they really you
know<00:05:39.700> get<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.419> work<00:05:40.570> so<00:05:40.870> I'm<00:05:41.260> thinking<00:05:41.560> that's

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
know get to work so I'm thinking that's

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.960 
know get to work so I'm thinking that's
why<00:05:41.740> they're<00:05:41.889> having<00:05:42.010> me<00:05:42.160> come<00:05:42.340> in<00:05:42.490> sooner
