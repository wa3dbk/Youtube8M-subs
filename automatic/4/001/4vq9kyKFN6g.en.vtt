dragons yes first video has just got
extremely<00:00:13.200> popular<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> last<00:00:14.400> few<00:00:14.610> days

extremely popular in the last few days
so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> thought<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.039> video<00:00:17.310> was

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
so I thought that that video was

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
so I thought that that video was
actually<00:00:17.580> made<00:00:18.000> when<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.690> eight<00:00:19.560> gigs<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
actually made when I had eight gigs of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.570 
actually made when I had eight gigs of
ram<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.640> I'll<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.939> 16<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.250> I'll<00:00:23.250> try<00:00:23.490> to
