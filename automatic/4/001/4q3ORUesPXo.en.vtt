job of accommodating that by designing
this<00:00:35.100> tire<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.700> absorb<00:00:36.120> impacts<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:37.110> very

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this tire to absorb impacts very very

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
this tire to absorb impacts very very
well<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.829> that's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> big<00:00:38.489> feature<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> big

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
well so that's a big feature or a big

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
well so that's a big feature or a big
highlight<00:00:40.110> point<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:40.920> were

and<00:01:00.870> grab<00:01:01.379> onto<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.829> terrain<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.340> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and grab onto that terrain because it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.050 
and grab onto that terrain because it's
already<00:01:02.820> hard<00:01:03.059> enough<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.850> block

already hard enough now in the block
design<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.750> thing<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> notice<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.380> away

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
design one thing you notice right away

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
design one thing you notice right away
there<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.010> no<00:01:08.159> tie<00:01:08.430> bars<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.030> any<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.510> these

blocks<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.140> been<00:01:10.350> eliminated<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.250> you're

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
blocks that's been eliminated so you're

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.620 
blocks that's been eliminated so you're
not<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> find<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.150> tying<00:01:12.479> these

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
not going to find those tying these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
not going to find those tying these
things<00:01:12.900> together<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.500> part<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
things together that's part of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
things together that's part of the
reason<00:01:14.220> how<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.520> increase<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> flexibility

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
reason how they increase the flexibility

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
reason how they increase the flexibility
of<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.960> tire<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> help<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> work<00:01:16.920> better<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of this tire to help it work better in

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580 
of this tire to help it work better in
those<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.090> muddy<00:01:18.299> conditions<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
those really muddy conditions now in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
those really muddy conditions now in
addition<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.450> there's<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.869> less

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
addition to that there's actually less

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
addition to that there's actually less
knobs<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.799> tire<00:01:23.009> than<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> previous

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
knobs on this tire than on the previous

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
knobs on this tire than on the previous
version<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> MX<00:01:24.600> 31<00:01:25.110> tire<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
version which was the MX 31 tire so the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
version which was the MX 31 tire so the
MX<00:01:26.340> 32<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.420> less<00:01:27.840> tire<00:01:28.110> blocks<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
MX 32 here has less tire blocks and they

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
MX 32 here has less tire blocks and they
do<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.570> provides<00:01:30.990> better

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
do this because it provides better

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
do this because it provides better
traction<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> sense<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
traction in the sense that it's going to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
traction in the sense that it's going to
dig<00:01:33.360> better<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.680> are

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
dig better these are a lot of these are

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
dig better these are a lot of these are
able<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.030> soft<00:01:36.509> soil<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
able to get into this the soft soil the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
able to get into this the soft soil the
mud<00:01:37.170> loam<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.400> deeply<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
mud loam really well very deeply and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.819 
mud loam really well very deeply and
these<00:01:39.990> middle<00:01:40.380> knobs

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
these middle knobs

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
these middle knobs
these<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.220> been<00:01:41.340> staggered<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.630> they

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
these have been staggered so what they

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.999 
these have been staggered so what they
do<00:01:42.810> basically<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> turn<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:43.979> different

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
do basically is turn these at different

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.670 
do basically is turn these at different
angles<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.600> different<00:01:46.079> angles

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
angles so what you get different angles

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
angles so what you get different angles
different<00:01:46.950> edges<00:01:47.490> different<00:01:47.970> pitches<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
different edges different pitches this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
different edges different pitches this
is<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> help<00:01:49.290> dig<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.040> terrain

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
is going to help dig into that terrain

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
is going to help dig into that terrain
much<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:50.939> efficiently<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:52.049> you'll<00:01:52.380> notice

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
much more efficiently also you'll notice

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
much more efficiently also you'll notice
the<00:01:52.740> side<00:01:52.979> blocks<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:53.970> similar

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the side blocks these are very similar

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
the side blocks these are very similar
to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> previous<00:01:54.689> version<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.350> very

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to the previous version these are very

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
to the previous version these are very
chiseled<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> ways<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
chiseled that's one of the ways that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.039 
chiseled that's one of the ways that
it's<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> dig<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it's actually going to dig when the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
it's actually going to dig when the
tires<00:01:58.259> leaned<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.100> way<00:01:59.159> over<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
tires leaned all the way over and that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.050 
tires leaned all the way over and that
maximum<00:02:00.030> attorney<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> capacity<00:02:01.140> now

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
maximum attorney and capacity now

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.130 
maximum attorney and capacity now
another<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.600> important<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
another things that that's important to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.469 
another things that that's important to
remember<00:02:04.229> about<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> tire<00:02:04.920> its<00:02:05.670> directional

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
remember about this tire its directional

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
remember about this tire its directional
now<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.320> meant<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> spin<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.369> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
now so it's meant to spin actually in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
now so it's meant to spin actually in
this<00:02:08.819> configuration<00:02:09.200> when<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.319> mounting

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440

this configuration when you're mounting
it<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> pay<00:02:11.400> attention<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
it you really have to pay attention to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.340 
it you really have to pay attention to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that now it's designed to work going one

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
that now it's designed to work going one
erections<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> new<00:02:14.430> feature<00:02:14.610> as
