00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
take which can be pretty funny but

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.640 
take which can be pretty funny but
probably<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> most<00:02:20.599> apparent<00:02:21.140> bad<00:02:21.349> thing

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
probably the most apparent bad thing

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.559 
probably the most apparent bad thing
about<00:02:21.739> this<00:02:21.980> movie<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.700> animation<00:02:23.239> at

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
about this movie is the animation at

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.260 
about this movie is the animation at
first<00:02:23.870> glance<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.590> doesn't<00:02:25.069> look<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.340> bad

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
first glance it doesn't look that bad

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.970 
first glance it doesn't look that bad
some<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.660> animation<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.349> actually<00:02:27.530> pretty

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
some of the animation is actually pretty

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.180 
some of the animation is actually pretty
smooth<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.660> very<00:02:30.020> inconsistent<00:02:30.800> at

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
smooth but it's a very inconsistent at

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.130 
smooth but it's a very inconsistent at
one<00:02:31.640> moment<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.030> will<00:02:32.090> be<00:02:32.150> frame<00:02:32.480> by<00:02:32.599> frame<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
one moment it will be frame by frame and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.050 
one moment it will be frame by frame and
then<00:02:33.319> it'll<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:33.950> weird<00:02:34.250> puppet<00:02:34.819> tool

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
then it'll be this weird puppet tool

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.990 
then it'll be this weird puppet tool
which<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.930> very<00:02:36.019> jarring<00:02:36.980> oh<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> not<00:02:37.849> to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
which is just very jarring oh and not to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.970 
which is just very jarring oh and not to
mention<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.599> no<00:02:38.840> shading<00:02:39.260> whatsoever

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980

it's just all flat colors and what's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.350 
it's just all flat colors and what's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
on Who Framed Roger Rabbit which are

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.340 
on Who Framed Roger Rabbit which are
great<00:03:18.709> animated<00:03:19.340> films<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.359> 2000s<00:03:21.049> he

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
great animated films but in the 2000s he

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.979 
great animated films but in the 2000s he
made<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.549> what<00:03:23.180> really<00:03:23.480> surprised

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
made this and what really surprised

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.569 
made this and what really surprised
me<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.859> was<00:03:25.100> theatrically

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
me is that this was theatrically

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.880 
me is that this was theatrically
released<00:03:25.730> not<00:03:26.450> nationwide<00:03:27.019> but<00:03:27.320> in<00:03:27.530> select

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
released not nationwide but in select

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.890 
released not nationwide but in select
theaters<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.519> did<00:03:28.790> get<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> wider<00:03:29.359> release<00:03:29.540> in

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
theaters it did get a wider release in

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.840 
theaters it did get a wider release in
European<00:03:30.380> countries<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.190> guess<00:03:31.459> South

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
European countries and I guess South

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.640 
European countries and I guess South
American<00:03:32.239> countries<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.049> was<00:03:33.230> critically

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
American countries and it was critically

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.220 
American countries and it was critically
panned<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.190> for<00:03:34.700> good<00:03:34.850> reason<00:03:35.150> it's<00:03:35.480> bad<00:03:35.720> it's

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
panned and for good reason it's bad it's

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.370 
panned and for good reason it's bad it's
really<00:03:36.470> bad<00:03:37.190> like<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.120> said<00:03:38.390> it's<00:03:38.720> available<00:03:39.019> to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380
