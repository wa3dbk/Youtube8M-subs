on my guitar off my guitar chains and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.280 
on my guitar off my guitar chains and
strings<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.000> just<00:01:01.690> about<00:01:01.870> as<00:01:02.019> good<00:01:02.080> as

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
strings and it is just about as good as

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.299 
strings and it is just about as good as
day<00:01:02.470> one

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
bit this is the small size but they also

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.150 
bit this is the small size but they also
make<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> medium<00:01:31.060> size<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:32.140> large<00:01:32.380> size<00:01:32.740> four

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
looking for years for the right dampener

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.400 
looking for years for the right dampener
and<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:51.010> is<00:01:51.280> definitely<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.150> one<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.300> me<00:01:52.660> so
