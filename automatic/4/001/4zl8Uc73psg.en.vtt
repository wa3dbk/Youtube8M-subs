 hi friends from youtube I'm mega 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.379
 quÃ¡sar 1 and I come to show you how 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.090
 put music in gta san andreas rick 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.090
 Well the truth is that it is very simple 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.940
 good to begin with they have to have the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.040
 folder gta san andreas user files la 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.040
 can locate in my documents 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.300
 good once in the folder we opened 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.940
 where it says user tracks as they see me already 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.830
 I have some music x of good what 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.470
 first is that they have the music that 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.230
 they are going to put in their gta san andreas copian 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.790
 the archives and then paste them into the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.790
 user tracks folder xd 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.160
 and he already has his music in his gta san 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.160
 andreas 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.290
 now I will show you how it works 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.240
 well they give it to main menu and they give it to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.579
 the option to configure sound after 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.039
 they go to user song options and 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.259
 they put it as I have it and then I 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.460
 they give to scan songs of the user and 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.830
 they will have the songs 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 now to test it they only put the radio 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.930
 of the user and will start sounding 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.729
 songs that you put forgives 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.229
 for not showing it but it is that the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.229
 volume was at 0 xd 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.240
 well that was all for today friends 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.240
