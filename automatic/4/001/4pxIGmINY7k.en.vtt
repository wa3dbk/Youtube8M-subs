00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
gas so that's where you pour in the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.320 
gas so that's where you pour in the
grease<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.799> 18<00:01:11.159> millimeter<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
grease and that's an 18 millimeter and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.280 
grease and that's an 18 millimeter and
here<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.900> which<00:01:13.020> I've<00:01:13.140> already

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
here on the side which I've already

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
here on the side which I've already
loosened<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.840> area<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> check<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
loosened is the area where you check the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
loosened is the area where you check the
oil<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.479> you're<00:01:18.630> filling<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.650> one

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
oil when you're filling it up this one

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.429 
oil when you're filling it up this one
is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> 10<00:01:20.490> millimeter<00:01:23.689> as<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.049> nothing's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
is a 10 millimeter as you see nothing's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.730 
is a 10 millimeter as you see nothing's
coming<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> means<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> low<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.549> oil<00:01:27.740> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
coming out that means it's low on oil so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.480 
coming out that means it's low on oil so
on<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.939> bottom<00:01:31.790> there's<00:01:32.790> another<00:01:33.240> bolt
