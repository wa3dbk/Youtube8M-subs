00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
medium island which my guy has finally

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.800 
medium island which my guy has finally
done<00:02:42.360> for<00:02:42.600> me<00:02:43.280> Arlo<00:02:44.280> okay<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
done for me Arlo okay so it's going to

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.140 
done for me Arlo okay so it's going to
take<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.410> couple<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.920> tries<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.550> couple<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.090> know

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
take a couple of tries a couple you know

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
take a couple of tries a couple you know
and<00:02:48.330> each<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.690> two<00:02:48.960> hours<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> clip<00:02:49.560> so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and each one is two hours at a clip so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.640 
and each one is two hours at a clip so
as<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.360> why<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.170> kind<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
as you can see that's why it's kind of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.260 
as you can see that's why it's kind of
taking<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.190> long<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.520> do<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.790> next<00:02:53.940> video

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
taking me so long to do this next video

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.210 
taking me so long to do this next video
because<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.740> took<00:02:55.890> me<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.160> long

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
because you know it took me that long

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.670 
because you know it took me that long
just<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.640> find<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> medium<00:02:57.030> eye<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.330> them<00:02:57.680> but

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
just to find a medium eye on them but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.130 
just to find a medium eye on them but
once<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.250> then<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.150> ready<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.660> okay

in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> last<00:03:17.040> patch<00:03:17.489> about<00:03:17.820> two<00:03:18.060> weeks<00:03:18.300> ago

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
question you being you probably are

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.390

asking is where do I find the sailors

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.949 
asking is where do I find the sailors
because<00:03:26.700> they've<00:03:26.850> changed<00:03:27.120> everything<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
because they've changed everything it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.810

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
used to be under naval engineer one of

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.390 
used to be under naval engineer one of
these<00:03:29.970> tabs<00:03:30.270> was<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:30.900> sailors<00:03:31.140> okay<00:03:31.830> which

made perfect sense okay you would have

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800 
made perfect sense okay you would have
to<00:03:35.100> hunt<00:03:35.400> down<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.580> sailor<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.330> would<00:03:36.630> click

to hunt down a sailor so you would click

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
to hunt down a sailor so you would click
on<00:03:36.989> his<00:03:37.140> little<00:03:37.290> icon<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.400> we'll<00:03:38.610> take<00:03:38.640> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
on his little icon and then we'll take a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.860 
on his little icon and then we'll take a
certain<00:03:39.030> amount<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.239> time<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.420> produce<00:03:39.630> a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
certain amount of time to produce a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.030 
certain amount of time to produce a
sailor<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.950> no<00:03:41.070> more<00:03:41.600> after<00:03:42.800> weeks<00:03:43.800> of

sailor that is no more after weeks of
trying<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:45.090> figure<00:03:45.360> out<00:03:45.540> how<00:03:45.959> why<00:03:46.260> they<00:03:46.530> broke

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
trying to figure out how why they broke

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.410 
trying to figure out how why they broke
the<00:03:46.950> system<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.459> finally<00:03:47.820> figured<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.360> that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
the system I finally figured out that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.509 
the system I finally figured out that
they<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:48.900> stuffed<00:03:49.290> all<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.800> sailors<00:03:50.070> down

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
theoretically I'm assuming that that's a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.590 
theoretically I'm assuming that that's a
throwback<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.340> time<00:04:14.640> where<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.120> business

throwback to a time where all business

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.630 
throwback to a time where all business
was<00:04:15.780> conducted<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.320> taverns<00:04:16.830> which<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.519> an

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
actual thing historically if you go back

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.340 
actual thing historically if you go back
to<00:04:19.560> like<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> 1300s<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.609> prior<00:04:21.239> people<00:04:22.169> would

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
to like the 1300s and prior people would

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.320 
to like the 1300s and prior people would
concrete<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.250> taverns<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.850> conduct
