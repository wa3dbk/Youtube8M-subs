00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
take some space on the shelves and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.480 
take some space on the shelves and
almost<00:01:08.490> everyone<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:10.070> every-every<00:01:11.070> really

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
almost everyone is every-every really

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000
