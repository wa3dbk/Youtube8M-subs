long<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:23.009> i<00:01:23.040> did<00:01:23.220> find<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> mount

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
long and what i did find with this mount

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.990 
long and what i did find with this mount
was<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> arm<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.220> short<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
was that this arm is a little short so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
was that this arm is a little short so
on<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> dash<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.869> car<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.439> needs<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
on a dash like my car it needs a little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
on a dash like my car it needs a little
bit<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.400> longer<00:01:29.579> arm<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.060> i'm<00:01:30.180> using<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
bit of a longer arm so i'm using is the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
bit of a longer arm so i'm using is the
actual<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:31.259> grabbed<00:01:31.470> playbook<00:01:31.890> arm<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
actual i grabbed playbook arm and you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
just attach your clip there but if you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.590 
just attach your clip there but if you
don't<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.670> playbook<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> buy

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
don't have playbook and you want to buy

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.160 
don't have playbook and you want to buy
two<00:01:37.350> pieces<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.430> use<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.240> adhere<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
two pieces you can use this adhere it to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.850 
two pieces you can use this adhere it to
your<00:01:40.350> dash<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.899> adhere<00:01:44.119> like<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
your dash and then they adhere like that

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.580 
your dash and then they adhere like that
only<00:01:46.860> downside<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> yes<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
only downside is yes you do have to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.950 
only downside is yes you do have to
place<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> sticky<00:01:49.979> pad<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.880> car<00:01:51.060> dash<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.310 

now<00:01:54.960> let's<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> look<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.189> actual<00:01:57.320> core

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
now let's take a look at the actual core

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.770 
now let's take a look at the actual core
this<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.979> car<00:02:01.979> holster<00:02:02.430> charger

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
this so this is your car holster charger

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
this so this is your car holster charger
right<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.460> clip<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> clip<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
right there and clip so the clip is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.980 
right there and clip so the clip is
pretty<00:02:06.360> simple<00:02:06.540> pull<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.530> out

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
pretty simple pull it out

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.880 
pretty simple pull it out
now<00:02:09.590> allows<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.010> to<00:02:10.160> extend<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.820> retract

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
now allows you to extend and retract

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.440 
now allows you to extend and retract
what<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.920> didn't<00:02:13.640> like<00:02:13.670> about<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
what I didn't like about this is that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.930 
what I didn't like about this is that
it's<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:15.080> easy<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.820> continually<00:02:16.820> change

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's not that easy to continually change

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.020 
it's not that easy to continually change
so<00:02:17.660> when<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.410> throw<00:02:18.770> your<00:02:18.890> phone<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.130> you're

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
so when you throw your phone in you're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.400 
so when you throw your phone in you're
not<00:02:20.150> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.330> want<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.510> continually<00:02:20.930> pull

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
not going to want to continually pull

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.660 
not going to want to continually pull
that<00:02:21.530> out<00:02:21.560> change<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.040> pulled<00:02:22.250> out<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.490> change

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
that out change it pulled out and change

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.250 
that out change it pulled out and change
it<00:02:22.850> especially<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.720> your<00:02:23.810> internet<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.170> your

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
it especially if your internet of your
