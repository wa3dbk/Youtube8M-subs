that<00:00:39.100> is<00:00:39.250> unavoidable<00:00:39.879> as<00:00:40.210> far<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.719> know

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
that is unavoidable as far as I know

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.189 
that is unavoidable as far as I know
there's<00:00:41.620> any<00:00:41.710> way<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:41.860> can<00:00:42.070> avoid<00:00:42.340> them

there's any way you can avoid them

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.970 
there's any way you can avoid them
bringing<00:00:44.199> out<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.440> ghosts

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.479 

now<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.760> easily<00:00:48.000> avoidable<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:50.070> going

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
now they are easily avoidable I'm going

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.380 
now they are easily avoidable I'm going
to<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:53.340> long<00:00:53.400> as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> keep<00:00:53.879> switching

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to do it as long as you keep switching

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
to do it as long as you keep switching
on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.720> lights<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.940> they're<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
on the lights then they're not really a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.170 
on the lights then they're not really a
big<00:00:57.750> deal

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.689 

doesn't<00:01:00.870> stuff<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.170> being<00:01:01.290> annoying

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.170 

now<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.539> a<00:01:05.950> looped<00:01:06.950> area<00:01:07.399> of<00:01:07.670> course<00:01:07.939> if

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
now that is a looped area of course if

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.690 
now that is a looped area of course if
you<00:01:08.270> don't<00:01:08.439> pick<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.619> right<00:01:09.740> half<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:10.460> will

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
you don't pick the right half you will

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.300 
you don't pick the right half you will
keep<00:01:11.360> going<00:01:11.600> back<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.810> forth<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:15.310> there's

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
keep going back and forth for there's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.679 
keep going back and forth for there's
another<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.579> later<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:17.030> in<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.240> act<00:01:17.329> as<00:01:17.509> well

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
another one later on in the act as well

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.240 
another one later on in the act as well
but<00:01:17.869> they're<00:01:18.020> both<00:01:18.170> easy<00:01:18.530> enough<00:01:19.039> for<00:01:19.310> early

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
but they're both easy enough for early

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.800 
but they're both easy enough for early
now<00:01:22.250> we're<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.490> keep<00:01:22.670> hanging<00:01:23.539> on<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.720> those

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
now we're to keep hanging on to those

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.770 
now we're to keep hanging on to those
lights<00:01:24.729> need<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.819> keep<00:01:25.970> ten<00:01:26.149> of<00:01:26.240> lights<00:01:26.479> on<00:01:26.659> in

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
lights need to keep ten of lights on in

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.200 
lights need to keep ten of lights on in
this<00:01:26.840> place<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:28.130> keep<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.759> ghosts<00:01:29.149> from

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
this place to keep the ghosts from

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.779 
this place to keep the ghosts from
coming<00:01:29.569> out<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.590> lights<00:01:30.799> dim<00:01:31.039> over<00:01:31.280> time<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
coming out the lights dim over time and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.639 
coming out the lights dim over time and
as<00:01:32.329> if<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.509> like<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.810> them<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.229> ghosts<00:01:33.500> get

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
as if I like to them the ghosts get

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.350 
as if I like to them the ghosts get
bigger<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.759> once<00:01:34.939> they<00:01:35.090> reach<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.329> certain

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
bigger and once they reach a certain

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.919 
bigger and once they reach a certain
size<00:01:35.929> I<00:01:36.289> want<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.920> high<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.069> completely<00:01:37.549> all

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
size I want the high to completely all

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.410 
size I want the high to completely all
they<00:01:38.929> start<00:01:39.500> actually<00:01:39.619> attacking<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:40.420> when

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
they start actually attacking you when

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.850 
they start actually attacking you when
there's<00:01:41.599> small<00:01:41.840> way<00:01:42.080> they<00:01:42.560> are<00:01:42.709> actually

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
there's small way they are actually

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.130 
there's small way they are actually
avoiding<00:01:43.459> they<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:44.659> spare<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
avoiding they just spare in the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.999 
avoiding they just spare in the
background<00:01:46.659> know<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:48.409> happens<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.770> me<00:01:48.799> every

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
background know that happens to me every

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.380 
background know that happens to me every
time

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.060 

see<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:54.260> they're<00:01:54.409> just<00:01:54.560> sort<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.800> floating

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
see here they're just sort of floating

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.070 
see here they're just sort of floating
around<00:01:55.280> in<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> background<00:01:55.790> not<00:01:56.659> really

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
around in the background not really

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.440 
around in the background not really
hurts<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.440> sonic<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.210> they're<00:01:59.330> big

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
hurts and sonic but when they're big

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.800 
hurts and sonic but when they're big
enough<00:01:59.510> they<00:01:59.840> will<00:01:59.960> attack<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:02.420> should<00:02:02.690> be

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
enough they will attack you we should be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.580 
enough they will attack you we should be
able<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.020> avoid<00:02:03.260> about<00:02:03.470> them

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.169
