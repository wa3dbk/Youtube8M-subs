00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.740 
okay I got fitting that off and I'm just
gonna<00:00:13.740> move

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.640 

that<00:00:17.560> motor<00:00:17.800> over

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.640 

pull<00:00:22.190> it<00:00:22.340> all<00:00:22.550> coupling<00:00:23.510> off<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:25.150> can<00:00:26.150> see

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
pull it all coupling off I can see

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:35.320 
pull it all coupling off I can see
already<00:00:27.650> that<00:00:28.010> that's<00:00:28.369> what's<00:00:28.640> broken<00:00:34.330> and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
already that that's what's broken and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.360 
already that that's what's broken and
this<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:35.840> pretty<00:00:36.020> common<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.040> breaks<00:00:37.160> on

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
this is pretty common that it breaks on

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.170 
this is pretty common that it breaks on
one<00:00:37.550> side<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:40.370> can<00:00:40.520> see<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.879> makes

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
one side of it and you can see it makes

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.290 
one side of it and you can see it makes
a<00:00:41.300> triangle<00:00:42.520> and<00:00:43.520> there's<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.820> cutout<00:00:44.000> for<00:00:44.239> the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
a triangle and there's a cutout for the

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.760 
a triangle and there's a cutout for the
shaft<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.780> motor<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.230> there<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
shaft of the motor right there and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.260 
shaft of the motor right there and
that's<00:00:46.220> what<00:00:46.400> happens<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:46.879> they<00:00:47.030> break<00:00:47.410> now

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
that's what happens is they break now

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.960 
that's what happens is they break now
this<00:00:50.270> part<00:00:50.600> costs<00:00:51.019> about<00:00:51.170> $20<00:00:53.739> new<00:00:54.970> I'm

it's not costing me anything to fix this

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.510 
it's not costing me anything to fix this
machine<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:03.440> want<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.829> do<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.100> flip<00:01:04.280> that

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
machine and we want to do is flip that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.590 
machine and we want to do is flip that
on<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:06.710> motor<00:01:06.890> shaft<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:11.149> other<00:01:11.330> one
