that these intimate portraits even as

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.569 
that these intimate portraits even as

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
vulnerable as they made me feel and

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.449 
vulnerable as they made me feel and
taking<00:01:52.909> them<00:01:53.090> were<00:01:53.959> a<00:01:54.319> representation<00:01:54.859> of<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
taking them were a representation of the

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.580 
taking them were a representation of the
vulnerability<00:01:56.179> that<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.390> felt<00:01:56.750> 15<00:01:57.140> years<00:01:57.409> ago

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
when my late husband and myself and my

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.440 
when my late husband and myself and my
daughter<00:02:02.119> my<00:02:02.659> entire<00:02:02.959> family<00:02:03.590> were<00:02:04.549> what

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
was pretty much a decision that we

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.309 
was pretty much a decision that we
should<00:02:16.129> have<00:02:16.370> made<00:02:16.549> as<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> family<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.569> not<00:02:17.930> be

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
should have made as a family and not be

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.160 
should have made as a family and not be
forced<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:20.030> from<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.590> press<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:23.170> my

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
forced to do from the press so my

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.099 
forced to do from the press so my
decision<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.799> do<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.549> really<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.359> decision

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
decision to do this is really a decision

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.720 
decision to do this is really a decision
stemming<00:02:27.829> from<00:02:27.859> the<00:02:28.310> feeling<00:02:28.639> of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
stemming from the feeling of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.470 
stemming from the feeling of
vulnerability<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.049> was<00:02:30.170> my<00:02:30.380> way<00:02:30.620> of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
vulnerability and it was my way of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:41.150 
vulnerability and it was my way of
confronting<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.630> myself

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.220
