room and neat in the hiney pot I have a
hole<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.069> top<00:03:11.329> /<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.840> took<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.040> rivet<00:03:14.370> out

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
hole in the top / I took the rivet out

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.720 
hole in the top / I took the rivet out
and<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.909> key<00:03:15.379> so<00:03:16.379> I<00:03:16.409> can<00:03:16.530> use<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.099> for<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.430> pro

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
and the key so I can use that for a pro

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.319 
and the key so I can use that for a pro
but<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.120> also<00:03:18.299> handy<00:03:18.689> for<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.560> steam<00:03:19.889> hole

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
but it's also handy for a steam hole

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.550 
but it's also handy for a steam hole
this<00:03:21.329> was<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.629> of<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:21.810> old<00:03:21.959> ones<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.379> has<00:03:22.530> a

this was one of the old ones it has a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.670 
this was one of the old ones it has a
magnet<00:03:23.099> on<00:03:23.189> the<00:03:23.250> top<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:26.389> you<00:03:27.389> could<00:03:27.599> use

too<00:03:50.040> much<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.840> fluid<00:03:51.840> gets<00:03:52.199> away

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.420 

I<00:03:59.159> guess<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.909> can<00:04:00.060> see<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.329> there

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
setting it with 60 degrees now put that

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.699 
setting it with 60 degrees now put that
on<00:04:10.909> the<00:04:11.150> pot<00:04:11.480> stand<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:14.290> let's<00:04:15.290> see<00:04:15.500> where

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
on the pot stand and let's see where

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:30.800 
on the pot stand and let's see where
this<00:04:15.739> goes

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.770 

okay<00:04:31.410> there<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.680> have<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.980> ten<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:35.190> eleven<00:04:35.780> to

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
okay there we have to ten to eleven to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.659 
okay there we have to ten to eleven to
twelve<00:04:37.169> at<00:04:37.470> six<00:04:38.130> thirty<00:04:38.280> one<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.970> looked<00:04:39.180> like

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
twelve at six thirty one it looked like

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.340 
twelve at six thirty one it looked like
we<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.760> boiling<00:04:41.970> water<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.510> six<00:04:42.750> minutes<00:04:42.960> 31

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
we have boiling water in six minutes 31

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.190 
we have boiling water in six minutes 31
seconds<00:04:44.450> let's<00:04:45.450> see<00:04:45.600> how<00:04:45.720> long<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.050> will

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
seconds let's see how long this will

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:55.250 
seconds let's see how long this will
burn<00:04:46.470> out<00:04:46.680> till<00:04:47.010> burnout<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.840> there<00:04:55.110> we<00:04:55.230> have

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
burn out till burnout and there we have

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.650 
burn out till burnout and there we have
run<00:04:55.680> out<00:04:55.710> look<00:04:56.190> like<00:04:56.370> get<00:04:56.610> 737<00:04:59.450> it's<00:05:00.450> actually

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
run out look like get 737 it's actually

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.570 
run out look like get 737 it's actually
still<00:05:01.169> burning<00:05:01.650> but<00:05:02.540> temperatures<00:05:03.540> dropping

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
still burning but temperatures dropping

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.860 
still burning but temperatures dropping
so<00:05:05.580> even<00:05:05.850> oh<00:05:05.940> there's<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.240> flame<00:05:06.479> it's<00:05:06.720> not

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
so even oh there's a flame it's not

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.900 
so even oh there's a flame it's not
adding<00:05:07.229> on<00:05:07.380> heat<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:13.110> not<00:05:13.260> too<00:05:13.500> bad<00:05:13.770> two<00:05:14.639> cups

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
adding on heat so not too bad two cups

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.510 
adding on heat so not too bad two cups
of<00:05:15.060> water<00:05:16.490> starting<00:05:17.490> at<00:05:18.560> 60<00:05:19.560> degrees<00:05:19.590> came<00:05:20.370> to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
of water starting at 60 degrees came to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.990 
of water starting at 60 degrees came to
a<00:05:20.550> boil<00:05:20.850> in<00:05:21.060> six<00:05:21.360> minutes<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.900> 31<00:05:22.169> seconds<00:05:22.770> and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
a boil in six minutes and 31 seconds and

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.770 
a boil in six minutes and 31 seconds and
ran<00:05:24.000> out<00:05:24.210> at<00:05:24.540> seven<00:05:24.990> minutes<00:05:25.260> 37<00:05:25.950> seconds

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
ran out at seven minutes 37 seconds

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.879 
ran out at seven minutes 37 seconds
using<00:05:28.070> about<00:05:29.070> two<00:05:30.000> tablespoons<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.889> denatured

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889

alcohol<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:33.060> what<00:05:33.389> has<00:05:33.540> got<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.840> be<00:05:33.870> one<00:05:34.169> of

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
alcohol and what has got to be one of

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.460 
alcohol and what has got to be one of
the<00:05:34.350> easiest<00:05:35.150> if<00:05:36.150> not<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.630> cheapest<00:05:37.110> as<00:05:37.289> long

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
the easiest if not the cheapest as long

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.340 
the easiest if not the cheapest as long
as<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:37.710> already<00:05:38.039> have<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.750> exhaust<00:05:39.750> wrap<00:05:40.080> and

as you already have the exhaust wrap and
a<00:05:40.560> little<00:05:41.460> bit<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:41.760> goes<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.060> long<00:05:42.390> way

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
a little bit of this goes a long way

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.180 
a little bit of this goes a long way
I've<00:05:42.810> used<00:05:43.020> this<00:05:43.200> on<00:05:43.410> a<00:05:43.440> lot<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.770> stuff<00:05:44.360> and
