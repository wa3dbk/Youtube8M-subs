00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
diagnosis of what marks are left on a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.570 
diagnosis of what marks are left on a
window<00:00:11.360> after<00:00:12.230> using<00:00:12.410> pure<00:00:12.769> water<00:00:13.009> and<00:00:13.249> what

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
window after using pure water and what

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.279 
window after using pure water and what
those<00:00:13.820> marks<00:00:14.150> might<00:00:14.330> mean<00:00:14.769> first<00:00:16.210> if<00:00:17.289> the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
those marks might mean first if the

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.990 
those marks might mean first if the
windows<00:00:19.330> is<00:00:20.330> clean<00:00:20.810> everywhere<00:00:21.730> but<00:00:22.730> you've

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
windows is clean everywhere but you've

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.720 
windows is clean everywhere but you've
got<00:00:23.150> marks<00:00:23.510> here<00:00:24.130> this<00:00:25.130> means<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.610> the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
got marks here this means that the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.460 
got marks here this means that the
person<00:00:26.240> who<00:00:26.390> was<00:00:26.510> cleaning<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:27.020> window<00:00:27.290> I'm

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
person who was cleaning the window I'm

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.320 
person who was cleaning the window I'm
going<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:27.650> hold<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:27.980> water<00:00:28.070> off<00:00:28.340> but<00:00:29.150> when

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
going to hold the water off but when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.139 
going to hold the water off but when
they<00:00:29.450> did<00:00:29.660> their<00:00:29.810> little<00:00:29.920> jets<00:00:30.920> they<00:00:31.820> didn't

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
they did their little jets they didn't

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.840 
they did their little jets they didn't
come<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.530> corner<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.399> they've<00:00:34.579> cleaned

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
come to the corner so they've cleaned

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.849 
come to the corner so they've cleaned
the<00:00:35.030> edge<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.420> they've<00:00:35.929> actually<00:00:36.260> left<00:00:36.469> dirty

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
the edge and they've actually left dirty

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.110 
the edge and they've actually left dirty
water<00:00:37.039> on<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.339> corner<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:39.019> second<00:00:39.530> is<00:00:40.120> if

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
water on the corner the second is if

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.860 
water on the corner the second is if
you've<00:00:41.449> got<00:00:41.480> marks<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.859> dirt<00:00:43.539> all<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:44.749> way

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
you've got marks of dirt all the way

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.110 
you've got marks of dirt all the way
along<00:00:45.109> there<00:00:45.469> but<00:00:46.249> the<00:00:46.339> whole<00:00:46.370> window<00:00:46.969> is

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
along there but the whole window is

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.119 
along there but the whole window is
clean<00:00:47.449> I<00:00:47.690> can<00:00:48.170> tell<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:48.769> they've<00:00:48.920> done

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
clean I can tell you what they've done

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.579 
clean I can tell you what they've done
the<00:00:49.609> window<00:00:49.940> cleaner<00:00:50.149> operator<00:00:50.719> run<00:00:51.469> the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
the window cleaner operator run the

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.910 
the window cleaner operator run the
water<00:00:52.600> like<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.140> he's<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:54.469> run<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.829> at

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
water like this and he's just run it at

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.119 
water like this and he's just run it at
the<00:00:55.039> top<00:00:55.249> yeah<00:00:56.089> and<00:00:56.929> he<00:00:57.019> hasn't<00:00:57.409> he<00:00:58.100> hasn't

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
the top yeah and he hasn't he hasn't

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
the top yeah and he hasn't he hasn't
chased<00:00:58.729> like<00:00:58.940> will<00:00:59.089> show<00:00:59.269> here<00:00:59.600> he<00:00:59.690> hasn't

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
chased like will show here he hasn't

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.139 
chased like will show here he hasn't
chased<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.469> water<00:01:00.649> down<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.190> what<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:01.940> means

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
chased the water down so what that means

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.360 
chased the water down so what that means
he's<00:01:02.329> cleaned<00:01:02.659> it<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.050> basically<00:01:03.889> the<00:01:04.190> dirt

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
he's cleaned it and basically the dirt

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.030 
he's cleaned it and basically the dirt
has<00:01:04.580> run<00:01:04.790> down<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.350> diluted<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.440> diluted<00:01:06.560> but

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
has run down and diluted and diluted but

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.590 
has run down and diluted and diluted but
now<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.490> starting<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.969> become<00:01:08.060> concentrated

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
now it's starting to become concentrated

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.480 
now it's starting to become concentrated
because<00:01:09.170> he<00:01:09.290> hasn't<00:01:09.409> chased<00:01:09.860> all<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.130> dirty

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
because he hasn't chased all the dirty

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.190 
because he hasn't chased all the dirty
water<00:01:10.610> off<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.090> start<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.600> see<00:01:11.780> marks

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
water off so you start to see marks

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.550 
water off so you start to see marks
along<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.100> bottom<00:01:13.219> edge<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:14.509> third<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.200> that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
along the bottom edge the third is that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.510 
along the bottom edge the third is that
you<00:01:15.860> see<00:01:16.070> dirt<00:01:16.810> down<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.990> edges<00:01:18.350> now<00:01:19.219> quite

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
you see dirt down the edges now quite

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.100 
you see dirt down the edges now quite
often<00:01:19.729> when<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.299> windows<00:01:20.600> fitted<00:01:20.990> is

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
often when the windows fitted is

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.319 
often when the windows fitted is
actually<00:01:21.439> silicon<00:01:21.890> as<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.430> little<00:01:22.759> smear<00:01:23.090> down

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
actually silicon as a little smear down

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.580 
actually silicon as a little smear down
the<00:01:23.479> edge<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:23.930> becomes<00:01:24.200> hydrophobic

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
the edge of so it becomes hydrophobic

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.980 
the edge of so it becomes hydrophobic
and<00:01:25.189> quite<00:01:25.909> often<00:01:26.090> you'll<00:01:26.329> see<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and quite often you'll see that the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.889 
and quite often you'll see that the
window<00:01:27.619> cleaner<00:01:27.890> he'll<00:01:28.549> go<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.090> but<00:01:29.780> if

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
window cleaner he'll go like this but if

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.679 
window cleaner he'll go like this but if
you<00:01:30.020> look<00:01:30.229> at<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.469> that<00:01:31.130> he<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.880> his<00:01:31.909> mind<00:01:32.119> he's

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
you look at it that he in his mind he's

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.319 
you look at it that he in his mind he's
seen<00:01:32.960> with<00:01:33.590> his<00:01:33.710> eyes<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.189> come<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:34.820> but

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
seen with his eyes that come to here but

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.590 
seen with his eyes that come to here but
the<00:01:35.450> jet<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:36.710> coming<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.189> there<00:01:37.399> so<00:01:37.640> he's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
the jet is coming to there so he's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.959 
the jet is coming to there so he's
imagining<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.740> he's<00:01:39.920> rinsed<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.369> there<00:01:40.579> but

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
imagining that he's rinsed to there but

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.609 
imagining that he's rinsed to there but
actually<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.659> only<00:01:41.810> rinsed<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.170> here<00:01:42.439> so

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
actually is only rinsed to here so

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.349 
actually is only rinsed to here so
you'll<00:01:42.770> get<00:01:42.920> dirty<00:01:43.280> water<00:01:43.460> sitting<00:01:43.789> down<00:01:44.030> here

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
you'll get dirty water sitting down here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.749 
you'll get dirty water sitting down here
the<00:01:45.259> fourth<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:45.859> is<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.820> really<00:01:47.299> unusual<00:01:47.420> one

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
the fourth one is a really unusual one

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.190 
the fourth one is a really unusual one
what<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.149> usually<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.570> first<00:01:50.810> time<00:01:51.020> use

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
what it is is usually the first time use

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.830 
what it is is usually the first time use
pure<00:01:51.469> water<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.250> put<00:01:52.729> way<00:01:53.090> too<00:01:53.119> much<00:01:53.539> pressure

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
pure water you put way too much pressure

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.169 
pure water you put way too much pressure
onto<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.950> onto<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:55.460> brush<00:01:55.609> so<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:55.939> watch

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
onto the onto the brush so you watch

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.209 
onto the onto the brush so you watch
this<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.289> full<00:01:57.530> pressure<00:01:57.799> from<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
this this is full pressure from the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.999 
this this is full pressure from the
brush<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:59.210> you've<00:01:59.390> got<00:01:59.539> maybe<00:02:00.200> two<00:02:00.859> meters

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
brush and you've got maybe two meters

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.139 
brush and you've got maybe two meters
when<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.090> come<00:02:02.390> at<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.320> window<00:02:03.729> what<00:02:04.729> happens

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
when you come at the window what happens

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.989 
when you come at the window what happens
is<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:06.350> splashing<00:02:07.070> against<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.460> window<00:02:07.759> so

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
is it's splashing against the window so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.090 
is it's splashing against the window so
the<00:02:08.119> dirty<00:02:08.479> water<00:02:08.660> let's<00:02:09.470> say<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:09.740> all<00:02:09.860> dirty

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
the dirty water let's say it's all dirty

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.339 
the dirty water let's say it's all dirty
right<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.390> dirty<00:02:11.720> water<00:02:11.870> when<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.200> watch

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
right and the dirty water when you watch

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.250 
right and the dirty water when you watch
them<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.950> jet<00:02:13.239> yeah<00:02:14.239> it's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
them the jet yeah it's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.679 
them the jet yeah it's
washing<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.890> dirty<00:02:16.129> water<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.819> as<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.510> come

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
washing the dirty water up as you come

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.960 
washing the dirty water up as you come
around<00:02:18.159> inevitably<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.340> spots<00:02:19.610> are<00:02:19.790> quite

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
around inevitably the spots are quite

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.990 
around inevitably the spots are quite
small<00:02:20.329> but<00:02:20.930> they're<00:02:21.110> actually<00:02:21.230> spotty<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
small but they're actually spotty the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.550 
small but they're actually spotty the
only<00:02:23.299> reason<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.629> can<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.840> spots<00:02:24.200> left<00:02:24.379> on

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
only reason you can have spots left on

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.080 
only reason you can have spots left on
