00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.670
 I want to show you a procedure. 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:16.910
 What do you do when your bag goes up? 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.910
 and my head and my teeth 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:31.019
 the person often cleans the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:38.670
 head and does not go out is because some 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.210
 times that her purse history one 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 welding machine 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 we make a filling with a barrel 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:14.479
 silicone filling the space for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.479
 let her stay 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:30.299
 we have to also test a device 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:32.549
 sound and we played with paint on top 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.670
 If it is leaking, we have to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.210
 refill the quality filling 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 You can spend there for five 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.930
 done here will not affect the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.530
 transition from the cartridge to the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.530
 head 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.329
 another thing that can not be has to be 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:03.439
 take care is with the level ie not 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.439
 It can get very high 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:13.950
 this investment because at a time when 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:17.890
 that part of the expenditure was 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.230
 she's going to have to stay at the right level 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 because when the cartridge fits 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:32.740
 and will not recognize the room 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.990
 else also happens that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 ribbon 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.700
 sometimes the person is wrong in the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 cartridge in the cartridge and you think the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.590
 cartridge problem in reality 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 sometimes it happens here 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:57.040
 with the contact is broken and then it does not 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 interprets the cartridge presence will 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.390
 one more call to you
