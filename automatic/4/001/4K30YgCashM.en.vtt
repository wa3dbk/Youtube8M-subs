they're<00:04:19.410> doing<00:04:19.620> backflips<00:04:20.280> off<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.640> top<00:04:20.850> rope

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
they're doing backflips off the top rope

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.880 
they're doing backflips off the top rope
I<00:04:21.180> mean<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.420> had<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.780> wouldn't<00:04:22.170> even<00:04:22.230> do<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
I mean I had I wouldn't even do the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.830 
I mean I had I wouldn't even do the
things<00:04:23.130> they're<00:04:23.370> doing<00:04:23.660> because<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
things they're doing because of the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.600 
things they're doing because of the
danger<00:04:25.230> just<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.530> themselves<00:04:25.950> if<00:04:26.130> nobody<00:04:26.460> else

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
danger just to themselves if nobody else

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.990 
danger just to themselves if nobody else
was<00:04:26.760> there<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.860> guess<00:04:29.340> they<00:04:29.490> felt<00:04:29.730> under

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
was there but I guess they felt under

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.210 
was there but I guess they felt under
deal<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.660> challenge<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.320> him<00:04:31.500> and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
deal that's the challenge to him and

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.800 
deal that's the challenge to him and
coming<00:04:32.670> off<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> top<00:04:33.060> most<00:04:33.240> most<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
coming off the top most most of the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.270 
coming off the top most most of the
states<00:04:34.080> would<00:04:34.290> not<00:04:34.470> allow<00:04:34.710> anybody<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.130> come

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
states would not allow anybody to come

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.700 
states would not allow anybody to come
off<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.550> top<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.110> was<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.620> was

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
off the top and so it was it was

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.330 
off the top and so it was it was
actually<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:39.330> know<00:04:39.450> where<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.900> could<00:04:40.110> get

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
actually you know where you could get

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.320 
actually you know where you could get
disqualified<00:04:41.340> if<00:04:41.520> there<00:04:41.640> were<00:04:41.700> free<00:04:41.940> culture
