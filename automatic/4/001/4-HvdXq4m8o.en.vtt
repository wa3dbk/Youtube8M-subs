which<00:01:28.710> i<00:01:28.890> figured<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.700> switch

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
which i figured just to get some switch

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
which i figured just to get some switch
initiative<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> switch<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
initiative if you want to switch out I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.050 
initiative if you want to switch out I
could<00:01:31.920> switch<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.250> something<00:01:32.549> appropriate<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
could switch in something appropriate to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
could switch in something appropriate to
that<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> stay<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.380> his<00:01:34.590> rc's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that if you want to stay with his rc's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.380 
that if you want to stay with his rc's
grass<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.430> switch<00:01:35.670> into<00:01:35.850> something<00:01:36.180> there

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
grass i can switch into something there

i<00:01:47.159> am<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> predict<00:01:48.509> him<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.110> switch<00:01:49.560> out

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
i am going to predict him to switch out

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.649 
i am going to predict him to switch out
during<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.310> earthquake<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.299> he's<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
during my earthquake but he's going to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
during my earthquake but he's going to
predict<00:01:52.049> me<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.500> predict<00:01:52.890> him<00:01:53.100> switching<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
predict me to predict him switching and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
predict me to predict him switching and
he's<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> Draco<00:01:55.049> while<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
he's going to go for the Draco while I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.010

go<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.890> rock<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.610> an

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
go from my rock so that was an

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.010 
go from my rock so that was an
some<00:01:57.200> play<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.710> Rich's<00:01:58.070> part<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:59.600> now<00:01:59.750> kind

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
some play on Rich's part and it now kind

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.599 
some play on Rich's part and it now kind
of<00:02:00.049> forces<00:02:00.409> me<00:02:00.560> into<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.799> quarter<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.189> little<00:02:01.460> bit

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
of forces me into a quarter a little bit

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.279 
of forces me into a quarter a little bit

because my crowd on is at a very low

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.679 
because my crowd on is at a very low
amount<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.619> HP<00:02:03.770> very<00:02:04.250> early<00:02:04.579> in<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:04.700> battle<00:02:04.880> so

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
amount of HP very early in the battle so

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
as well as much as I would like to come

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.759 
as well as much as I would like to come
anyways<00:02:10.519> like<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.150> said<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:12.260> because<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.500> am<00:02:12.680> at

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
anyways like I said just because I am at

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.229 
anyways like I said just because I am at
a<00:02:12.830> low<00:02:12.950> amount<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.220> HP<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.760> am<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.180> switch

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
a low amount of HP I am going to switch

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.759 
a low amount of HP I am going to switch
out<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.720> am<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:14.959> going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.260> into<00:02:15.470> my

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
out and I am now going to go into my

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.500 
out and I am now going to go into my
Blaziken<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.489> he's<00:02:16.700> going<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> predict<00:02:17.360> my

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
Blaziken as he's going to predict my

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.030 
Blaziken as he's going to predict my
switch<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> go<00:02:17.989> for<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.200> stealth<00:02:18.530> rocks<00:02:18.769> in

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
switch and go for the stealth rocks in

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.430 
switch and go for the stealth rocks in
here<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.879> figured<00:02:20.599> because<00:02:20.840> he's<00:02:21.049> kind<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.319> been

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
here I figured because he's kind of been

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.259 
here I figured because he's kind of been
over<00:02:21.709> predicting<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.280> little<00:02:22.549> bit<00:02:22.670> he's<00:02:23.090> going

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
over predicting a little bit he's going

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.059 
over predicting a little bit he's going
to<00:02:23.330> continue<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:24.049> that<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.739> that's<00:02:24.920> why<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
to continue to do that so that's why I

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.320 
to continue to do that so that's why I
went<00:02:25.340> straight<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.910> high<00:02:26.000> jump<00:02:26.030> kick

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
went straight for the high jump kick

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
went straight for the high jump kick
here<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.989> really<00:02:27.230> wanting<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> play<00:02:27.950> around

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
here not really wanting to play around

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.190 
here not really wanting to play around
with<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.450> actually<00:02:29.630> did<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> damaged

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
with it and I actually did a damaged

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.990 
with it and I actually did a damaged
calc<00:02:30.349> after<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.160> i<00:02:31.190> am<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> leftovers

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
calc after this because i am a leftovers

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.960 
calc after this because i am a leftovers
Blaziken<00:02:32.590> um<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:34.160> about<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.370> 50-50<00:02:34.790> chance

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
Blaziken um I had about a 50-50 chance

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.479 
Blaziken um I had about a 50-50 chance
of<00:02:35.329> killing<00:02:35.540> him<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.230> damage<00:02:37.010> rolls<00:02:37.190> were<00:02:37.400> in

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
of killing him so damage rolls were in

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.420 
of killing him so damage rolls were in
my<00:02:37.610> favorite<00:02:38.000> there<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.260> anyways<00:02:39.650> he's<00:02:40.280> going

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
to just predict him too much to go for

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.970 
to just predict him too much to go for
the<00:02:44.540> whirlwind<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.530> phase<00:02:45.709> me<00:02:45.890> out

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the whirlwind here just to phase me out

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.069 
the whirlwind here just to phase me out
which<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.220> why<00:02:46.489> i<00:02:46.519> did<00:02:46.760> not<00:02:46.790> set<00:02:47.660> up<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.810> swords

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
which is why i did not set up a swords

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.009 
which is why i did not set up a swords
dance<00:02:48.260> or<00:02:48.440> anything<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:50.299> go

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
dance or anything like that here so go

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.110 
dance or anything like that here so go
for<00:02:51.170> flare<00:02:51.440> blitz<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.890> unfortunately<00:02:52.790> get<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
for flare blitz I unfortunately get the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.699 
for flare blitz I unfortunately get the
burn<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:54.049> don't<00:02:54.260> think<00:02:54.319> it<00:02:54.560> made

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
burn but I really don't think it made

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.740 
burn but I really don't think it made
that<00:02:55.010> big<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.430> deal<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:55.819> after<00:02:56.629> this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
that big of a deal because after this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.720 
that big of a deal because after this

parallax<00:04:20.410> here<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.949> don't<00:04:21.579> really<00:04:21.699> think<00:04:21.880> it

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
parallax here I don't really think it

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.089 
parallax here I don't really think it
mattered<00:04:22.389> um<00:04:22.660> doesn't<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:23.800> not<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:24.039> he

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
mattered um doesn't it's not like he

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.890 
mattered um doesn't it's not like he
gets<00:04:24.250> paralyzed<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.669> anything<00:04:25.030> but<00:04:25.270> he<00:04:25.690> drops

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
gets paralyzed or anything but he drops

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.020 
gets paralyzed or anything but he drops
a<00:04:25.990> thunder<00:04:26.259> on<00:04:26.349> me<00:04:26.530> from<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.490> damage<00:04:27.820> he's

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
a thunder on me from that damage he's

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.390 
a thunder on me from that damage he's
clearly<00:04:28.419> specs<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.680> don't<00:04:30.009> want<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.280> miss

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
clearly specs and I don't want to miss

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.860 
clearly specs and I don't want to miss
like<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.610> spatial<00:04:31.000> render<00:04:31.270> anything<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.750> was

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
like a spatial render anything I was

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.270 
like a spatial render anything I was
really<00:04:32.050> paranoid<00:04:32.349> about<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:33.130> whole

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
really paranoid about that this whole

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.860 
really paranoid about that this whole
battle<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.669> don't<00:04:33.940> know<00:04:34.090> why<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.690> I'm<00:04:34.750> just

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
battle I don't know why so I'm just

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.510 
battle I don't know why so I'm just
gonna<00:04:34.960> go<00:04:35.199> ahead<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.410> drop<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.680> second<00:04:36.250> thunder

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
gonna go ahead and drop a second thunder

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.219 
gonna go ahead and drop a second thunder
as<00:04:36.699> he's<00:04:37.150> going<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.570> switch<00:04:37.750> into<00:04:37.900> his<00:04:38.080> art

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
as he's going to switch into his art

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.640 
as he's going to switch into his art
sees<00:04:38.410> grass<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.830> take<00:04:39.039> that<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:40.270> here<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.840> don't

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
sees grass to take that in here I don't

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.770 
sees grass to take that in here I don't
really<00:04:41.830> know<00:04:42.099> what<00:04:42.250> he<00:04:42.400> was<00:04:42.520> predicting<00:04:43.150> um<00:04:43.389> I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
really know what he was predicting um I

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.210 
really know what he was predicting um I
think<00:04:44.050> if<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.169> switched<00:04:44.440> out<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> would<00:04:44.979> die<00:04:45.190> to

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
think if I switched out I would die to

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.370 
think if I switched out I would die to
rock<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:45.669> that's<00:04:45.789> why<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> stayed<00:04:46.330> in<00:04:46.479> here<00:04:46.750> but

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
rock so that's why I stayed in here but

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.170 
rock so that's why I stayed in here but
I'm<00:04:47.620> gonna<00:04:47.770> go<00:04:47.949> for<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.130> spacial<00:04:48.490> rend<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:48.880> i

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
I'm gonna go for a spacial rend and i

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.589 
I'm gonna go for a spacial rend and i
miss<00:04:49.990> which<00:04:50.349> is<00:04:50.470> kind<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.740> unfortunate<00:04:51.599> but

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
miss which is kind of unfortunate but

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.629 
miss which is kind of unfortunate but
anyways<00:04:52.960> he<00:04:53.349> keeps<00:04:53.560> switching<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:54.159> here<00:04:54.460> and

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
anyways he keeps switching in here and

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.820 
anyways he keeps switching in here and
it's<00:04:55.300> kind<00:04:55.570> of<00:04:55.659> bad<00:04:55.780> for<00:04:55.840> him<00:04:56.199> just<00:04:56.380> because<00:04:56.590> he

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
it's kind of bad for him just because he

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.379 
it's kind of bad for him just because he
keeps<00:04:57.009> racking<00:04:57.280> up<00:04:57.490> stealth<00:04:57.789> rocks<00:04:57.970> damage

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
keeps racking up stealth rocks damage

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.779 
keeps racking up stealth rocks damage
and<00:04:58.650> again<00:04:59.650> i'm<00:04:59.800> just<00:04:59.979> gonna<00:05:00.099> drop<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.430> thunder

and again i'm just gonna drop a thunder

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.610 
and again i'm just gonna drop a thunder

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
here because well spacial rend just

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.140 
here because well spacial rend just
missed<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.009> that<00:05:03.099> just<00:05:03.280> goes<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.520> show<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.759> my

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150

gonna<00:05:06.849> go<00:05:07.000> for<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> spacial<00:05:07.599> rend<00:05:07.750> here<00:05:07.960> knowing

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
gonna go for a spacial rend here knowing

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.960 
gonna go for a spacial rend here knowing
that<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:09.159> definitely<00:05:09.460> going<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.610> be<00:05:09.669> enough

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
that it's definitely going to be enough

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.879 
that it's definitely going to be enough
to<00:05:10.150> KO<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.599> RCS<00:05:10.990> grass<00:05:11.139> from<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.470> range<00:05:11.650> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
to KO the RCS grass from that range and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.770 
to KO the RCS grass from that range and
his<00:05:12.400> Kyogre<00:05:12.789> if<00:05:12.849> he<00:05:12.940> wants<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.330> bring<00:05:13.449> that<00:05:13.630> in

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
his Kyogre if he wants to bring that in

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.659 
his Kyogre if he wants to bring that in
for<00:05:13.930> some<00:05:14.110> weird<00:05:14.320> reason<00:05:14.490> that'll<00:05:15.490> definitely

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
for some weird reason that'll definitely

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.969 
for some weird reason that'll definitely
be<00:05:15.849> gone<00:05:16.090> but<00:05:16.720> anyways<00:05:17.050> inhale<00:05:17.440> comes<00:05:17.740> his

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
be gone but anyways inhale comes his

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.100 
be gone but anyways inhale comes his
Kabutops<00:05:18.520> now<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:19.000> because<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.509> brain<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.840> up

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
Kabutops now and because the brain is up

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.990 
Kabutops now and because the brain is up
he's<00:05:20.949> gotta<00:05:21.130> be<00:05:21.220> faster<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.610> i<00:05:21.669> didn't<00:05:21.909> feel

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
he's gotta be faster and i didn't feel

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.370 
he's gotta be faster and i didn't feel
like<00:05:22.060> switching<00:05:22.479> in<00:05:22.570> anything<00:05:22.810> really<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.289> I'm

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
like switching in anything really so I'm

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.230 
like switching in anything really so I'm
just<00:05:23.500> gonna<00:05:23.590> fight<00:05:23.919> her<00:05:24.009> out<00:05:24.130> my<00:05:24.340> Palkia<00:05:24.940> here

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
just gonna fight her out my Palkia here

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.760 
just gonna fight her out my Palkia here
so<00:05:25.659> I<00:05:25.719> can<00:05:25.780> get<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.930> safe<00:05:26.169> switch<00:05:26.409> into<00:05:26.650> my

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
so I can get a safe switch into my

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.399 
so I can get a safe switch into my
ground<00:05:27.009> on<00:05:27.099> and<00:05:28.030> get<00:05:28.240> up<00:05:28.270> my<00:05:28.449> son<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.020> not<00:05:29.320> only

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
ground on and get up my son and not only

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.980 
ground on and get up my son and not only
that<00:05:29.530> but<00:05:29.979> I'm<00:05:30.550> actually<00:05:30.849> coaxing<00:05:31.539> him<00:05:31.690> sort

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
that but I'm actually coaxing him sort

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.830 
that but I'm actually coaxing him sort
of<00:05:32.139> 2a<00:05:32.650> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.520> for<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.210> low<00:05:34.360> kick<00:05:34.599> because

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
of 2a going to for the low kick because

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.209 
of 2a going to for the low kick because
his<00:05:35.080> waterfall<00:05:35.440> won't<00:05:35.650> be<00:05:35.740> doing<00:05:35.860> anything

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
his waterfall won't be doing anything

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.249 
his waterfall won't be doing anything
under<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.699> Sun<00:05:36.940> stone<00:05:37.750> edge<00:05:37.930> won't<00:05:38.169> be

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
under the Sun stone edge won't be

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.080 
under the Sun stone edge won't be
hitting<00:05:38.409> me<00:05:38.620> very<00:05:38.800> hard<00:05:39.039> so<00:05:39.580> this<00:05:39.759> gives<00:05:39.880> me<00:05:40.000> a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
hitting me very hard so this gives me a

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.670 
hitting me very hard so this gives me a
pretty<00:05:40.389> good<00:05:40.539> opportunity<00:05:41.259> to<00:05:41.349> switch<00:05:41.530> into

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
pretty good opportunity to switch into

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.249 
pretty good opportunity to switch into
my<00:05:42.070> are<00:05:42.250> sees<00:05:42.460> ghosts<00:05:42.759> to<00:05:43.090> take<00:05:43.719> the<00:05:43.840> predicted

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
my are sees ghosts to take the predicted

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.740 
my are sees ghosts to take the predicted
low<00:05:44.440> kick<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.580> should<00:05:45.639> be<00:05:45.909> able<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.389> get<00:05:46.659> up

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
low kick and I should be able to get up
