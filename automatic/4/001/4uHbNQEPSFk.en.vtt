um this is Tinga well this is kind of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
um this is Tinga well this is kind of
expensive<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.860> small<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
expensive just to be like this small on

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
expensive just to be like this small on
the<00:00:47.789> side<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> tank<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.690> look<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the side of the tank like look at the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.950 
the side of the tank like look at the
tank<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> looking<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.879> small<00:00:51.120> but

tank it looking like it's that small but
that's<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:52.469> that's<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.250> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that's I guess that's good because for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
that's I guess that's good because for
likely<00:00:54.719> OSes<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.170> whatever<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.280> anyway<00:00:57.379> um

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
likely OSes or whatever but anyway um

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.779 
likely OSes or whatever but anyway um
