00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
meatball so the whole this whole thing

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.520 
meatball so the whole this whole thing
started<00:03:28.730> with<00:03:28.879> peasant<00:03:29.299> food<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.750> using

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
started with peasant food and using

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.390 
started with peasant food and using
leftovers<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.849> know<00:03:31.939> what<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:33.129> if<00:03:34.129> you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
leftovers so you know what like if you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.710 
leftovers so you know what like if you
don't<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.879> parsley<00:03:35.299> but<00:03:35.629> you<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:40.720> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
don't have parsley but you have you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720 
don't have parsley but you have you
basically<00:03:42.109> can't<00:03:42.409> screw<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.709> up<00:03:42.859> unless<00:03:43.159> you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
basically can't screw it up unless you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420 
basically can't screw it up unless you
don't<00:03:44.150> follow<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:45.290> magic<00:03:45.470> ratio<00:03:46.129> because

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
don't follow the magic ratio because

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.309 
don't follow the magic ratio because
it's<00:03:46.879> so<00:03:47.120> long<00:03:47.239> as<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:47.480> meatball<00:03:47.900> sticks

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
not from how its mixed and then the next

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.960 
not from how its mixed and then the next
step<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:20.949> just<00:05:21.100> gonna<00:05:21.190> be<00:05:21.340> rolling<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.699> in<00:05:21.820> rows
