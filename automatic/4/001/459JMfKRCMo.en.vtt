00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.300
 60 to 70% 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 because this huge among the products so

 it's still there when we know that we can not treat almost 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.549
 not diverse it is still a treatment per week on his lap 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.879
 on the rest of the year it's not trivial treatments 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.739
