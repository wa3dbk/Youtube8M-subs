00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.250
 warm welcome in front of the door 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 welcome 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 that just explained later 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.730
 and now we come to one 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 small presentation and that with before 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.330
 sent a mouse a few months ago 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.539
 say it again and say something about it 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.340
 the whole thing is called roccat kone optical 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 she should pack and find that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:43.829
 I'm pretty cool and the mouse looks like that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 wait a minute the cable hangs pretty 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 ding well made, let us 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.460
 to sum up keys that is the 1 2 3 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.410
 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 and when the high- 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 and down the wiiw still with 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.430
 counts and sees at first sight 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.109
 The thing is a bit small, too 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 is also a bit smaller 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 Great thoughts on my part because of me 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 big hands but I joined the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.360
 time used to it like me the mouse 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.850
 Overall, I'll tell you at the end of the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.369
 videos now I'll tell you first 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 a little something to the software and there 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.700
 we also get to the point that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.750
 this thing goes on lit up 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.770
 and maybe some of you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 not and you asked yourself why go 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.229
 that's how the software looks pretty 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.360
 As I think you can 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.950
 unbelievable ship there 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 Personally, I do not use it all 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 but at least I'll show you the one 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.530
 things I find it pretty cool 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 which I actually use more often 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 is the setting of the number and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.790
 that's what you do here with plus and minus 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.330
 you probably already know that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.400
 dpa and here you can even the steps 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 the individual dpi settings themselves 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.120
 adjust that means if I want that 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.070
 the next step is not going to 1200 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.770
 but also directly on 3000 then do 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.760
 I hit it here and go for 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 me pretty useful 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 on the second page you want me 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.530
 a bit interesting and you can 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.670
 because the buttons set 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.500
 you probably already can from 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.060
 other software magic at rocket 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.010
 There's the so-called the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.750
 shift-button you can see here 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.250
 the four that's the normal one 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.440
 it probably asks the browser 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.120
 Ace with you and if you pressed the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 holds then you can feel all the others 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.780
 new evidence that means for me is the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 browser forward button in which I 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 again press the shift key and easy 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 then the right mouse button again 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.930
 you can also recognize the eleven here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.850
 with me then suddenly ahv pretty well 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.560
 horny one can press the shift key 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.420
 hold and then with the mouse wheel up and up 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 can shut down and use the systems 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.989
 sound just louder and quieter 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.580
 so pretty cool 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.260
 You can cut quite a bit here 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.090
 There are presets for games 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.440
 and programs and so on, you can 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.550
 over romping for the buck 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.350
 have and we go to the others 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.670
 Options continue to work either way with the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.920
 Department now at the beginning 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.410
 seen my mouse glows blue and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.880
 all the time you can change everything 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.269
 For example, I can say that I like 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.549
 that my mouse is breathing and that in red 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.190
 I press on lead and we have already 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.190
 the salad the thing glows red round 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.690
 and breathes that i have changed because 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.340
 that annoyed me at night and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.680
 set up because my other hardware 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.160
 and the tower and all the lights are blue 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.930
 that fits so well and this is the one 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.550
 statistics page of roccat which draws 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.200
 me exactly how many times you left and 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.209
 press right mouse button or how many times 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.340
 mausrad be moved and so on and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.500
 he gives trophies for and come here 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.140
 We also already at the beginning of the story 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.970
 of the video and that's just it 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.520
 that's why I surfed the internet 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.170
 totally silent suddenly the guy asks me 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.519
 and I thought my right became 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.620
 hacked so I did not know where that 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.850
 and that was just the one 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.470
 point that I won a trophy 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.620
 I have my mouse for that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.640
 have moved a bit 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.780
 luckily you can hear the volume of the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.560
 sprechers but up here too 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.690
 drive down a bit 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.330
 you can also make out but that 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.560
 i find myself a bit sad i am 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.970
 honestly I think the mouse is easy 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.010
 pretty horny she is very very good 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.810
 processed and very very directly 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.640
 just shooters like cod or something 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.380
 that very very useful and I believe 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.299
 that this optical sensor or some 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.709
 to do 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.060
 Maybe she likes some of you 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.410
 be a bit small when you go 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.579
 short the mouse and my hand accept 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.500
 the hero sees it a bit 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.430
 strange but after 12 weeks I have 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.600
 get used to it and it works wonderfully 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.270
 the whole thing can be influenced a bit 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.100
 be through the roccat hero mouse pad 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.600
 I've also got to have the 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.690
 his blue areas had surface with it 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.020
 slip around and ask for one 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.970
 Organized mouse pad area is quasi 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.200
 a mix of a soft mousepad 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.700
 and a hard plastic mouse pad 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.500
 pretty cool, I'm amazing 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.360
 Loved it I never thought 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.490
 that I'm excited about the mouse pad 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.340
 the whole is a bit more expensive 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.650
 I think 39 99 on the rocket side 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.140
 But fucking is worth every cent so 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.850
 me is a much mustard on it like 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.040
 could not just wash off like that and 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.140
 the mouse works wonderfully 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.310
 Conclusion moderately, I can recommend 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.630
 if you have a closer look 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.670
 want to throw in the description 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.020
 is on the left enquete side and still wants 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.600
 want to see more here are a few 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.550
 videos from gamescom 2014 were allowed 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.990
 I test a few prototypes of what 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.370
 but they already share 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.420
 Thank you very much 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.980
 watch if you liked it 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.450
 let's still like thumbs up there and 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.590
 see you next time the 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.590
 it was then and
