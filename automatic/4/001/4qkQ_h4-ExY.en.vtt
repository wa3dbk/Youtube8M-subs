00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
watched my videos before I had a couple
of<00:01:45.479> 90s<00:01:45.960> been<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.330> ended<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:50.130> doing

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of 90s been up and I ended up just doing

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.169 
of 90s been up and I ended up just doing
her<00:01:50.610> myself

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
her myself

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.609 
her myself
I<00:01:52.640> used<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.819> original<00:01:54.030> flange<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.990> had<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.440> make

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I used the original flange I had to make

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
I used the original flange I had to make
a<00:01:56.810> couple<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.049> small<00:01:58.200> cuts<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a couple of small cuts in here so that I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.279 
a couple of small cuts in here so that I
could<00:02:00.420> give<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.500> angle<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
could give this a little more angle and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.270 
could give this a little more angle and
then<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.410> attached<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.099> one<00:02:05.459> of<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.119> new<00:02:06.270> 90s

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
then I attached on one of my new 90s

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.240 
then I attached on one of my new 90s
added<00:02:08.280> bracket<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.440> reason<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
added bracket and the reason I had to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
added bracket and the reason I had to
add<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.209> extra<00:02:12.420> angel'<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.349> as<00:02:13.680> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
add little extra angel' to it as I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
add little extra angel' to it as I
decided<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:15.030> through<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.330> hood<00:02:15.599> at

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780

isn't determined yet my guess is

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.839 
isn't determined yet my guess is
probably<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.079> get<00:04:09.170> cut<00:04:09.379> off<00:04:09.530> about<00:04:10.489> here

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
probably going to get cut off about here

probably going to get cut off about here
