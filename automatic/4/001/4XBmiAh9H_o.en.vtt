00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 Here I bring you a video in which we are going 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 to combine the base with very sequences 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 little phrases of bulerías that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.420
 they will last either half a measure or 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 an entire compass and at most two this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.130
 it is very practical to understand the compass 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.200
 in tiny sections and practice what 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.780
 is the combination and change the order and 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.730
 a little improvisation in the 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.730
 bulerías I will play what I got 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.520
 now I'm going to play the phrases that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.660
 they go half a measure, that is, I mean 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.660
 base of the bulería that I proposed 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 here 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 I can not count 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.170
 a setback there before doing the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 phrase well that to do is medium 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.400
 compass I have to remove an index of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.210
 the rise of the base instead of doing 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.210
 here three times 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.590
 OK 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.150
 then we can do half of the base 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.150
 and the fan 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.540
 the setback 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.930
 that also of compass 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.190
 now I'm going to touch the phrase that lasts a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.640
 whole compass I make a base and then the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.640
 whole sentence 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 Y 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.900
 a phrase with a boost that lasts two 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.900
 we make a whole base 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.750
 two 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.570
 Now I'm going to play everything often for 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.920
 that you see the possibilities of changing 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.510
 the order and combine these small 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.860
 phrases that you can be playing only with 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.860
 this for at least 20 minutes 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.459
 Y
