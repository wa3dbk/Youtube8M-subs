show you some of the some of the
features<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.470> that<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.190> before<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
features of that but before I do I just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.920 
features of that but before I do I just
wanted<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> reiterate<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.040> importance<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
wanted to reiterate the importance of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
wanted to reiterate the importance of
dressing<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.500> elements<00:00:55.979> and<00:00:56.159> in<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
dressing for the elements and in this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.600 
dressing for the elements and in this
case<00:00:56.729> we<00:00:57.540> try<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> promote<00:00:58.080> dressing<00:00:58.769> for<00:00:59.519> the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
case we try and promote dressing for the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.180 
case we try and promote dressing for the
water<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> air<00:01:00.780> temperature<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.619> the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.680 
water and not the air temperature in the
summertime<00:01:02.729> we<00:01:03.089> could<00:01:03.269> have<00:01:03.390> an<00:01:03.510> air

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
summertime we could have an air

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.609 
summertime we could have an air
temperature<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> land<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.750> 80<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.260> 100

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
degrees Fahrenheit the water temperature

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
degrees Fahrenheit the water temperature
is<00:01:11.820> significantly<00:01:12.030> colder<00:01:12.840> than<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is significantly colder than that so in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.690 
is significantly colder than that so in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
centigrade that's actually quite cold

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.560 
centigrade that's actually quite cold
considering<00:01:26.429> your<00:01:26.579> body<00:01:26.969> temperature

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
considering your body temperature

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
considering your body temperature

depending on what book you read is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.179 
depending on what book you read is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
between thirty six point one degrees

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.830 
between thirty six point one degrees
sended<00:01:33.149> centigrade<00:01:33.539> or<00:01:33.719> Celsius<00:01:33.899> up<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
thirty seven point eight degrees

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.639 
thirty seven point eight degrees
centigrade<00:01:38.969> or<00:01:39.149> Celsius<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:40.109> the<00:01:40.229> average

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
centigrade or Celsius with the average

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.160 
centigrade or Celsius with the average
or<00:01:41.039> mean<00:01:41.280> body<00:01:41.969> temperature<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.719> normal

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
or mean body temperature for a normal

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.370 
or mean body temperature for a normal
healthy<00:01:43.679> person<00:01:44.369> being<00:01:44.969> right<00:01:45.570> around<00:01:45.780> 37

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
healthy person being right around 37

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.919 
healthy person being right around 37
degrees<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:47.429> there's<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.179> differential

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
degrees so there's quite a differential

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.109 
degrees so there's quite a differential
between<00:01:49.109> your<00:01:49.499> body<00:01:49.740> temperature<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
between your body temperature and the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.429 
between your body temperature and the
temperature<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.719> water<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.289> Bay<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
temperature of the water and the Bay of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
temperature of the water and the Bay of
Fundy<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.819> put<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> barrier

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Fundy so if you don't put a barrier

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.620 
Fundy so if you don't put a barrier
between<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.499> body's<00:01:55.950> core<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> water

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
between your body's core and that water

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
between your body's core and that water
temperature<00:01:58.009> you're<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.249> to<00:01:59.429> slip<00:01:59.670> into

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
temperature you're going to slip into

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
temperature you're going to slip into
hypothermia<00:02:00.450> rather<00:02:00.960> quickly<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.740> your

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
hypothermia rather quickly when your

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
hypothermia rather quickly when your

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
body drops below that thirty-six point

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.279 
body drops below that thirty-six point
one<00:02:04.799> degrees<00:02:05.159> centigrade<00:02:05.999> or<00:02:06.119> Celsius<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
one degrees centigrade or Celsius you

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.590 
one degrees centigrade or Celsius you
start<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.799> into<00:02:07.950> hypothermia<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.240> starts

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
start to go into hypothermia it starts

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.840 
start to go into hypothermia it starts
with<00:02:09.690> shivering<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.100> shivering<00:02:11.460> stops

with shivering when the shivering stops

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.570 
with shivering when the shivering stops
you're<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.720> even<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.500> trouble<00:02:13.560> you've<00:02:14.340> gone

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
you're in even more trouble you've gone

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.430 
you're in even more trouble you've gone
into<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.330> second<00:02:15.690> stage<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.900> hypothermia

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
into in the second stage of hypothermia

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.040 
into in the second stage of hypothermia
things<00:02:17.280> starting<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.730> serious<00:02:18.180> where<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
things starting to get serious where you

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.740 
things starting to get serious where you
start<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.950> lose<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.310> ability<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.750> think

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
start to lose the ability to think

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.300 
start to lose the ability to think

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.309 
properly and make rational logical
judgment<00:02:26.790> calls

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
judgment calls

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.819
