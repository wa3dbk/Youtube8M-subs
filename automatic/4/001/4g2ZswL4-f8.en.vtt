it is it I guarantee you're 99% of the

it is it I guarantee you're 99% of the
places<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> flank<00:00:48.570> steak<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.260> words<00:00:49.469> that

come<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.190> hotel<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.420> from<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.840> flank

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
come to my hotel it comes from our flank

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.830 
come to my hotel it comes from our flank
it's<00:00:52.530> underneath<00:00:53.130> the<00:00:53.309> belly<00:00:53.550> over<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.210> okay

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it's underneath the belly over here okay

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
it's underneath the belly over here okay
okay<00:00:55.379> where<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.980> guess<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
okay where it's I guess the reason that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
okay where it's I guess the reason that
it<00:01:00.149> has<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.110> elasticity<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it has a lot of elasticity is because it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.090 
it has a lot of elasticity is because it
needs<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.949> somewhat<00:01:04.949> give<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.969> know

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
needs to somewhat give you know

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.810 
needs to somewhat give you know
supporting<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> weight<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
supporting a lot of weight on that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.660 
supporting a lot of weight on that
correct<00:01:09.510> direct<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:11.190> why<00:01:11.369> you've<00:01:11.520> got

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
correct direct that's why you've got

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
correct direct that's why you've got
those<00:01:11.820> long<00:01:12.090> fibers<00:01:12.690> fight<00:01:13.049> running<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
those long fibers fight running for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.789 
those long fibers fight running for
Southern<00:01:14.369> again<00:01:14.700> stretch<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.619> one

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
Southern again stretch yeah and then one

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
Southern again stretch yeah and then one
get<00:01:16.979> slicing<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> want<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> cut<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> cross

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
get slicing that you want to cut a cross

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.850 
get slicing that you want to cut a cross
goes<00:01:19.619> fiber<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.460> recognize<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.480 

once<00:01:24.550> you<00:01:24.700> really<00:01:25.150> okay<00:01:26.260> once<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.190> grill<00:01:27.460> it

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
once you really okay once you grill it

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.790 
once you really okay once you grill it
then<00:01:27.970> you're<00:01:28.120> ready<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.540> slice<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.590> is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
then you're ready to slice it this is

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.870 
then you're ready to slice it this is
how<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:29.950> slice<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.370> across<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.000> grain<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
how you slice it across the grain and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.150 
how you slice it across the grain and
it'll<00:01:34.150> make<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.450> much<00:01:34.870> easier<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.590> correct

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
it'll make it much easier to correct

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.100 
it'll make it much easier to correct
break<00:01:36.610> apart<00:01:36.940> in<00:01:37.060> your<00:01:37.150> mouth<00:01:37.210> cut<00:01:38.020> around

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
break apart in your mouth cut around

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.230 
break apart in your mouth cut around
root<00:01:38.410> slices<00:01:38.940> exactly

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
root slices exactly

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.510 
root slices exactly
yeah<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.930> see<00:01:41.080> how<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.380> breaks<00:01:41.620> up<00:01:42.400> a

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
yeah you can see how it breaks up a

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.350 
yeah you can see how it breaks up a
spider's<00:01:43.150> very<00:01:44.020> timber<00:01:44.850> roll<00:01:45.850> away<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.090> what

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
even well done what will it still be a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880 
even well done what will it still be a
