kill streak and in games after that when

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.390 
kill streak and in games after that when
I<00:03:17.209> continued<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.780> use<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:18.470> strategy<00:03:18.860> I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
I continued to use this strategy I

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.340 
I continued to use this strategy I
continued<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.390> well<00:03:20.570> like<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.840> had<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.990> twenty
