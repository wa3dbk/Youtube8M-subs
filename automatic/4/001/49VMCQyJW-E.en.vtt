00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.270
 The Chamber decided to do that on its own 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.700
 she stayed in it alone sitting around the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.950
 effortlessly daughter and knew about her 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.540
 Do not live a council that you understood 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 none of this how to straw to gold 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 could spiders and their fear became 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.729
 getting bigger that they finally cry 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.710
 when the door started to open 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.259
 and a little male entered and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.080
 Good evening young mediator spoke 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.299

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 said the girl 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.409
 The male at the collar sat down 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.680
 in front of the wheel and purr whiskers 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 The coil was pulled three times 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 full 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.369
 then another person put it on and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.880
 away until the morning 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.810
 there was everything stanza cocking and all 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.820
 Traces were full of gold at sunrise 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 came the king and when he got the gold 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.090
 looked surprised but was happy 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.800
 his heart was only greedy for money 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.140
 He let the miller's daughter into one 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.930
 other chamber full straw bring the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.890
 life would be nice 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.160
 The girl did not have to help 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.470
 and cried the door opened again 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.840
 and the little male appeared and 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.879
 Finger answered the girl that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.549
 male took the ring started again 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.860
 purr with the wheel and had to 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.579
 Tomorrow everything straw to shiny gold 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.459
 spun 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.440
 The king was over the measure at 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.110
 a sight was still not 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.209
 the gold tired but let the müllers 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.940
 dipped into an even bigger chamber 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.379
 bring straw and still spoke the pattern 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.959
 spiders in this night 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.540
 but if that succeeds you should 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.030
 my are ground 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.700
 because he thought a richer woman can 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.099
 in the world do not have as the girl 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.109
 Alone was that came to the third 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.359
 once again addressed what do you give me 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.329
 If I straw you this time 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.510
 spider I have nothing left to eat 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.340
 could give the girl answered so 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.220
 your first child who knows how else 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.139
 thought the miller's daughter and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.889
 also knew nothing else in the emergency 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.139
 to help 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.569
 So she promised the male what he did 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.720
 demanded and the male cocked for it 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.880
 once again the straw to gold 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.250
 and when in the morning the king came and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.260
 Everything took place as he had wished 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.370
 held the wedding with her and the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.989
 beautiful miller's daughter was a queen 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.359
 over a year she brought a beautiful 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.730
 child to the world and did not think anymore 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.130
 to the male the wheel of the sudden 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.919
 their chambers and spoke now give me something 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.709
 you promised the queen was frightened 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.410
 All dimensions and boats people all 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.049
 wealth of the kingdom if it 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.750
 but every child wanted to do that 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.289
 male did not speak live something that is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.630
 I rather than anything appreciate the world 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.500
 then the queen began to moan and so 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.870
 to cry 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.510
 that the male felt sorry for her 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.190
 and I said three days I want you time 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.420
 if you have until then my name 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.400
 So you should keep your child 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.980
 Now the queen thought all night 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.770
 about all the names she ever heard 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.140
 had and sent a messenger over land 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.080
 he should inquire far and wide 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.510
 wide for new names than at the other 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.230
 day the male came she started with 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.270
 casper melchior balzer and said all 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.300
 Names she knew after the series 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.260
 but in every one of man's words 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.590
 I'm not hot 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.900
 The second day she asked around 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.350
 with all the people and told the men 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.720
 the most unusual and bizarre ago 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.040
 you are sniffing merchandise 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.720
 but it does not stay that hot 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.260
 the third day the boat came back 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.000
 back and told new names I have 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.070

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.860

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.970

 so I saw a small house and before 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.500
 A fire was burning around the house and around it 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.130
 fire jumped and even too ridiculous 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.960
 Munich hopped on one leg and screamed

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.510
 The day after tomorrow I will bring your child to the queen 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.530

 very glad that she knew the name as 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.560
 Soon after the little man came in asked 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.280

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.470
 right foot with anger so deep in the earth 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.240
 that it went in until a loaf 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.610

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.030

 in half in half
