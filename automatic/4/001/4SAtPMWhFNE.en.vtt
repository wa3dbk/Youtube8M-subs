that the bass sound is pretty crippled

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.560 
that the bass sound is pretty crippled
so<00:01:16.260> what<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> did<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.550> record<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.690> I

so what I did to record this is I
recorded<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> top<00:01:22.320> main<00:01:22.710> bass<00:01:22.980> track

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
recorded to this top main bass track

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.980 
recorded to this top main bass track
here<00:01:23.760> which<00:01:23.910> I'll<00:01:24.060> show<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.270> what's<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.870> on

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
here which I'll show you what's going on

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
here which I'll show you what's going on
there<00:01:25.260> I've<00:01:25.440> just<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.830> compression<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.730> bass

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
there I've just got compression a bass

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.150 
there I've just got compression a bass
amp<00:01:27.120> model<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.720> distortion<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.979> what

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
amp model and some distortion then what

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.920 
amp model and some distortion then what
I<00:01:29.190> did<00:01:29.370> once<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.880> done<00:01:30.120> recording<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I did once I was done recording is I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
I did once I was done recording is I
copied<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.190> other<00:01:32.400> track<00:01:32.820> where

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
copied it over to this other track where

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.020 
copied it over to this other track where
I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.680> crusher<00:01:35.100> effect<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
I have this bit crusher effect now the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.790 
I have this bit crusher effect now the
reason<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.479> did<00:01:36.660> it<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.870> two<00:01:37.080> tracks<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
reason I did it with two tracks here is

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320 
reason I did it with two tracks here is
I<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.100> trying<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:38.880> track

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
I was trying to do it all in one track

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.690 
I was trying to do it all in one track
and<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.660> bit<00:01:39.840> crusher<00:01:40.200> effect<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and the bit crusher effect was just like

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
and the bit crusher effect was just like
too<00:01:41.970> overbearing<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:42.960> still<00:01:43.260> wanted<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
too overbearing but I still wanted that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.290 
too overbearing but I still wanted that
buzzy<00:01:44.070> sound<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> background<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.180> on

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
buzzy sound in the background that's on

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.980 
buzzy sound in the background that's on
the<00:01:45.390> original<00:01:45.720> track<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.840> doubled<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the original track so I just doubled the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
the original track so I just doubled the
track<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.650> then<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.580> at<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> lower<00:01:50.970> volume

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
track and then put it at a lower volume

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.410 
track and then put it at a lower volume
you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.750> I've<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.610> 9.8<00:01:53.610> DB<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you can see I've got it it 9.8 DB as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
you can see I've got it it 9.8 DB as

negative<00:01:56.460> six<00:01:57.119> point<00:01:57.300> seven<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.350> let's<00:01:58.770> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
negative six point seven so let's just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
negative six point seven so let's just
look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> effects<00:01:59.940> here<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.890> main

now<00:03:55.560> here's<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.549> really<00:03:56.870> important<00:03:57.870> part<00:03:58.079> is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
now here's the really important part is

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.530 
now here's the really important part is
this<00:03:58.349> bit<00:03:58.590> crusher<00:03:59.040> effect<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.790> only<00:04:00.120> setting

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
this bit crusher effect the only setting

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.390 
this bit crusher effect the only setting
I<00:04:00.599> could<00:04:00.780> find<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.379> actually<00:04:01.829> sounded<00:04:02.190> good

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
I could find that actually sounded good

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.670 
I could find that actually sounded good
was<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.450> resolution<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:04.200> eight<00:04:04.409> bit

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
was to have the resolution at eight bit

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.949 
was to have the resolution at eight bit
and<00:04:04.920> have<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.819> sample<00:04:06.209> rate<00:04:06.299> reduction<00:04:06.810> all

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
and have the sample rate reduction all

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.470 
and have the sample rate reduction all
the<00:04:07.049> way<00:04:07.139> down<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.560> 1x<00:04:08.090> anything<00:04:09.090> more<00:04:09.299> than

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
the way down to 1x anything more than

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.879 
the way down to 1x anything more than
that<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.629> it<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.049> started<00:04:10.290> sounding<00:04:10.709> like

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
that and it just started sounding like

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.949 
that and it just started sounding like
too<00:04:11.159> much<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> broken<00:04:11.970> Nintendo<00:04:12.450> game<00:04:12.689> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
too much like a broken Nintendo game and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720 
too much like a broken Nintendo game and
what<00:04:13.560> not<00:04:13.829> enough<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.459> organic

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
what not enough like an organic

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.629 
what not enough like an organic
distortion<00:04:15.480> sound<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.350> then<00:04:16.739> even<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.489> the

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
distortion sound so then even at the

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.449 
distortion sound so then even at the
bottom<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.150> chain<00:04:18.389> I've<00:04:18.630> got<00:04:19.459> another

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
bottom of the chain I've got another

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.390 
bottom of the chain I've got another
distortion<00:04:21.180> effect<00:04:21.539> with<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.199> drive<00:04:22.500> at<00:04:22.830> 34

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
distortion effect with the drive at 34

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.990 
distortion effect with the drive at 34
and<00:04:23.430> 1/2<00:04:23.639> DB<00:04:24.139> tone<00:04:25.139> is<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.380> 2600<00:04:26.190> Hertz<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.759> the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and 1/2 DB tone is a 2600 Hertz and the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.050 
and 1/2 DB tone is a 2600 Hertz and the
output<00:04:27.330> level<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.750> at<00:04:27.990> 9<00:04:28.349> point<00:04:29.039> negative<00:04:29.400> 9.5

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
output level is at 9 point negative 9.5

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.370 
output level is at 9 point negative 9.5
DB<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.860> then<00:04:32.010> I've<00:04:32.130> got<00:04:32.340> some<00:04:33.060> EQ<00:04:33.780> on<00:04:33.810> here<00:04:34.169> I

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
DB and then I've got some EQ on here I

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.050 
DB and then I've got some EQ on here I
don't<00:04:34.470> even<00:04:34.620> think<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:35.039> put<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.520> on<00:04:35.669> purpose

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
don't even think I put this on purpose

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.420 
don't even think I put this on purpose
it<00:04:36.210> just<00:04:36.360> kind<00:04:36.539> of<00:04:36.570> ended<00:04:36.840> up<00:04:36.960> there<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:38.070> that

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
it just kind of ended up there so that

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.890 
it just kind of ended up there so that
doesn't<00:04:38.729> even<00:04:38.820> matter<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:39.660> I've<00:04:39.750> got<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
doesn't even matter and then I've got a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.140 
doesn't even matter and then I've got a
little<00:04:39.990> bit<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.410> reverb<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.889> this<00:04:41.039> track<00:04:41.370> at<00:04:41.699> 10

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
little bit of reverb on this track at 10

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.300 
little bit of reverb on this track at 10
percent<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.750> other<00:04:42.780> track<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.440> think<00:04:43.470> has<00:04:44.010> no

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
percent the other track I think has no

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.870 
percent the other track I think has no
reverb<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.849> anything<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:46.310> let's<00:04:47.310> listen<00:04:47.820> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
reverb or anything so let's listen a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.899 
reverb or anything so let's listen a
little<00:04:48.000> bit<00:04:48.150> here's<00:04:48.539> what<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.789> retract<00:04:50.789> I

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
little bit here's what the retract I

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.790 
little bit here's what the retract I
recorded<00:04:51.419> sounds<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.960> without<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.590> bit

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
recorded sounds like without the bit

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:05.210 
recorded sounds like without the bit
crusher<00:04:53.159> effect

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.370 

and<00:05:06.220> here's<00:05:07.090> what<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.330> sounds<00:05:07.660> like<00:05:07.720> with<00:05:08.199> the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
and here's what it sounds like with the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.560 
and here's what it sounds like with the
two<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.710> them<00:05:08.830> together<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.580> main<00:05:10.210> track<00:05:10.540> and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
two of them together the main track and

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.900 
two of them together the main track and
the<00:05:10.930> bit<00:05:11.110> crusher<00:05:11.470> track<00:05:11.830> just<00:05:12.550> from<00:05:12.699> where<00:05:12.820> we

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
the bit crusher track just from where we

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:23.460 
the bit crusher track just from where we
left<00:05:13.060> off

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.250 

so<00:05:24.760> that's<00:05:25.760> that's<00:05:26.240> how<00:05:26.420> I<00:05:26.450> got<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.110> does

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
so that's that's how I got it it does

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.750 
so that's that's how I got it it does
sound<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.860> little<00:05:27.890> bit<00:05:28.280> better<00:05:28.310> with<00:05:28.730> the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
sound a little bit better with the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.820 
sound a little bit better with the
original<00:05:29.150> track<00:05:29.390> going<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:30.050> because<00:05:30.530> then

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
original track going to because then

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.560 
original track going to because then
there's<00:05:31.070> a<00:05:31.340> little<00:05:31.730> bit<00:05:31.850> of<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.090> original

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
there's a little bit of that original

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.510 
there's a little bit of that original
bass<00:05:32.720> track<00:05:33.220> complimenting<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.370> but

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
bass track complimenting it but

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.950 
bass track complimenting it but
obviously<00:05:34.640> if<00:05:35.150> you're<00:05:35.270> just<00:05:35.450> playing<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:35.840> your

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
obviously if you're just playing on your

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.450 
obviously if you're just playing on your
own<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.650> sound<00:05:36.830> you're<00:05:37.040> getting

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.370 

so<00:05:43.460> that's<00:05:43.639> that<00:05:43.880> that's<00:05:44.210> how<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.360> did<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:44.930> I

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
so that's that that's how I did it I

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.529 
so that's that that's how I did it I
know<00:05:45.590> it's<00:05:45.889> not<00:05:46.039> perfect<00:05:46.669> but<00:05:46.910> I<00:05:46.970> managed<00:05:47.419> to

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
know it's not perfect but I managed to

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.570 
know it's not perfect but I managed to
do<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.900> this<00:05:48.229> well<00:05:48.470> in<00:05:48.740> GarageBand<00:05:49.310> without

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
do it this well in GarageBand without

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.159 
do it this well in GarageBand without
having<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:49.820> go<00:05:49.940> out<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.210> buy<00:05:50.300> vintage<00:05:50.810> effects

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
having to go out and buy vintage effects

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.830 
having to go out and buy vintage effects
pedals<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.710> stuff<00:05:52.150> now<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.210> one<00:05:53.570> thing<00:05:53.750> I

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
pedals and stuff now the one thing I

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.810 
pedals and stuff now the one thing I
didn't<00:05:54.169> cover<00:05:54.440> here<00:05:54.800> is<00:05:54.949> that<00:05:55.220> there<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.580> an

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
didn't cover here is that there is an

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.200 
didn't cover here is that there is an
low<00:05:56.360> octave<00:05:56.900> added<00:05:57.410> on<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.889> original<00:05:58.520> song<00:05:58.759> in

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
low octave added on the original song in

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.350 
low octave added on the original song in
the<00:05:59.750> pre<00:06:00.080> verse<00:06:00.350> sections<00:06:01.009> when<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.970> vocals

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the pre verse sections when the vocals

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.210 
the pre verse sections when the vocals
are<00:06:02.479> not<00:06:02.630> happening<00:06:02.930> there's<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.770> lower<00:06:03.979> octave
