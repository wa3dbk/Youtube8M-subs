here I can barely see it okay here it is

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.380 
here I can barely see it okay here it is
at<00:02:03.520> 90<00:02:04.150> beats<00:02:04.450> per<00:02:04.570> minute<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.970> again<00:02:07.240> it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
at 90 beats per minute and this again it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:03:19.750 
at 90 beats per minute and this again it
starts<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.720> end<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.170> three

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.630 

I<00:03:20.320> hope<00:03:21.320> that<00:03:21.590> some<00:03:21.980> other<00:03:22.130> people<00:03:22.400> are

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
I hope that some other people are

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.920 
I hope that some other people are
watching<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.060> they<00:03:23.240> decide<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> same

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
watching this they decide to do the same

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.740

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
thing where they're just transcribing

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.780 
thing where they're just transcribing
solos<00:03:26.750> every<00:03:26.840> single<00:03:27.200> day<00:03:27.640> because<00:03:28.640> it's

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
solos every single day because it's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.500 
solos every single day because it's
really<00:03:28.910> paying<00:03:29.180> off<00:03:29.360> after<00:03:29.780> doing<00:03:30.670> 111<00:03:31.670> 111

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
really paying off after doing 111 111

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.430 
really paying off after doing 111 111

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
plus looks now and the effect on my ears

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.140 
plus looks now and the effect on my ears
is<00:03:36.650> fantastic<00:03:37.370> into<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.790> general

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
musicianship that I have when I'm

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.100 
musicianship that I have when I'm
playing<00:03:40.190> with<00:03:40.340> other<00:03:40.520> musicians<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.450> highly

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
these transcriptions by ear and training

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.720 
these transcriptions by ear and training
in<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:46.640> way<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:47.030> really<00:03:47.150> effective
