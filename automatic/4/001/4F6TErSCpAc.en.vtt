know why HTC never made this case in
other<00:01:36.630> colors<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> definitely

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
other colors because this is definitely

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
other colors because this is definitely
the<00:01:38.340> sickest<00:01:38.490> case<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.630> highs<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.740 
cutouts for the speakers and all that
this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> definitely<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> sickest<00:01:42.090> case<00:01:42.450> but

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this is definitely the sickest case but

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
this is definitely the sickest case but
you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> only<00:01:43.500> comes<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> color<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> if

you know only comes in this color and if

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.910 
you know only comes in this color and if
you<00:01:44.970> look<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.299> mines<00:01:45.540> after<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.530> where
