00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.370
 the following is the explanation of a 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.560
 real game session so you can 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.600
 contain incomplete instructions and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.210
 some mistakes in this is the game of 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.060
 roma at least they are placed to these chips 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.040
 in the middle of the board they represent 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.860
 the dice from 1 to 6 plus silver and cards 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.610
 then each player is given 10 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.160
 victory points 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.710
 and four letters plus four letters the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.630
 player sees them choose two and in both 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.280
 who does not want the player delivers 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 opposite so that everyone leaves with 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.690
 four letters but at least I know which 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.370
 are the two cards that have the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.130
 principle of the game we have to place 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.780
 these letters and we place the letters 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.330
 in any position where I want 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.580
 that will be activated in the future when 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.000
 leave that name then at the beginning 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.510
 the game 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.230
 the two players are going to have two 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.820
 free spaces that are not with letters 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.100
 then comes the way to play that only in 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 turn if repeated several times what 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.960
 First of all, it's paying taxes 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.450
 if I have free chips as in 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.140
 this case and I have two free chips myself 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.910
 I'll talk to you about two victory points 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.590
 obviously the first round I pay two 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.110
 story points because I have two 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.910
 free spaces because it is paying to 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.650
 bank two story points and it's not 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.390
 complete the whole story is 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.610
 only with the delegates this and this one 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.280
 they never have letters then here the dice 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.770
 and if I get everything all the same as one 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 I could re-launch then I can 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
 perform actions I have four options 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.690
 what to do with the result of octaves the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.090
 first action I can do is put 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.759
 a letter in play this letter to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.479
 putting it into play has a cost here 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.970
 above 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.210
 here he tells me that he requires one side and here 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.869
 down tells me what it is that causes 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.390
 then this letter costs 4 that he wants 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.450
 say that to play it here I should 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.220
 pay 4 with coins did not count histories 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.009
 but with coins then I pay 4 the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 bank and I can download it by reviewing all 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.729
 the actions that I that at least 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 they want to win until I can go down if 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.050
 example, I would like to write this letter 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.420
 here the previous letter I vote 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.330
 I put it here and I pay the paintings what 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.340
 second is to assign the dice 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.530
 I can not assign a die for example 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.940
 I can assign given in two since 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.070
 I am activating together the letter that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.660
 work a little highlight this given here 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.510
 to activate just the letter that is here 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.120
 or we could stay on 3 and say what am I going to 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.730
 assign to this to steal three cards or 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.160
 6 will designate him stealing silver and rose and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.260
 gold coins and these actions the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 repeating and in the order that I want 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.459
 I draw matching cards to sign until it 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 I finished the dice until I was 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.150
 finish the silver and it's the player's turn 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.360
 next that does exactly the same 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.780
 and the letters have different things like 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.549
 then we can see them in details that 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.400
 they eliminate the letter in front of another 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.489
 player give me points of wins and the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.489
 Active allows me to download other cards 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.560
 let's talk a little about the letters 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.569
 that are the objective of the game or everything 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.700
 the game is based on the cards the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.430
 letters down here say what they cause 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.099
 Here it tells me if they are activated with dice or 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.099
 without die for example is in the basilica 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.220
 that does not need to be activated and 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.410
 if any the letters from the sides 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.180
 win victory points the basilica I 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.470
 gives two more points of hector strassera the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.300
 Syndic always in being next to a 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 big letter for this story there are other 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.110
 letters that if now active I can search 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.410
 in the most a character and I take it to 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.390
 miserly there are other letters that for example 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.500
 delete a character in front there is 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.750
 other cards that execute a battle and 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.720
 that is a particular letter for example 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.760
 yes I if the opponent who is here 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.120
 here is going to attack tells you that it attacks the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 letter from the front what he does is throw the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.650
 attack side 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.900
 for example 3 and compares it to my 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.349
 defense that is that little box with a 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.349
 shield 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.180
 and if the defense is greater I could 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.459
 defend if it is equal or less 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.100
 I lost because the attacker had the same 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.169
 or more force upside down then the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.360
 attacker has here the benefit and 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.190
 when the attacker manages to eliminate the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.229
 Letter to the letter leaves and the 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.550
 space and obviously in the next turn 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.620
 I'm going to lose a victory point 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.449
 because I have a letter less because 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.009
 we know that for each space not 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.150
 have a letter I want a story point 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.770
 principle the turn is not won 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.540
 the one with the most history points 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.040
 take out the game when you can no longer 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.060
 steal victory point when someone gets 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.060
 it remains without points of interest
