00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.090
 good afternoon potter gets good always 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.680
 I say good afternoon but better is not 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.410
 living at night 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.270
 in the morning 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.450
 good welcome to a new video today 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.820
 there will be another tutorial about harry stuff 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.439
 potter like new to learn more to 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.460
 learn to do them and today we will see 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.430
 three little things 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.410
 first of all we'll see here is what 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.269
 I just printed the bus ticket 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.860
 night owl is worth here you have the ticket 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.910
 this is the one that has printed me but 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.040
 well I'll show you the one I had 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.470
 before but although I like this one I like 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 rather more this than the previous one seems 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.710
 much more real seems much more of the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.080
 movie the previous one yes I did it 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 I'm not going to show you the ones here is this 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.059
 the one that had previously done here what 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 you have also very good but good 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.030
 this is not what we are going to do today in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.039
 second part one thing that I have been asked 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.379
 many is already the poster of is looking for 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.570
 sirius black is worth here is javi sing is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 with or because here we have it simply 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.899
 I'll give you the link to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 print it good I did not say that in the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.100
 foot of the night bus I've 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 mentioned above you just have to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.670
 cut it if you want to plasticize what 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.430
 some thing is worth but if not only 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.479
 cut it and you're worth it and finally here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.530
 there are chocolate frog boxes yes 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 here is the cutout here is the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.429
 template that within a little 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.740
 we will proceed to do so that all 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.050
 let's see how although good does not have 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.810
 loss because he simply tells you 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.479
 everything or it tells you all the lines by 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.700
 where you have to cut and paste but I 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.250
 I have to tell you how not to leave 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.899
 always good and that is what we will do to fuck 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.310
 I do not stop getting up for things here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.280
 I have the previous model that says of the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.560
 frog of the frog not of the box sorry 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 is the one they sell in 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.659
 this is the model that they sell in the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 harry potter theme park good 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.640
 any harry potter site that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.040
 you buy something chocolate 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.550
 comes out this evil is this 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.990
 based and well I did this as 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.930
 I did also Salazar Slytherin 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.400
 here it is because just because it is the 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.710
 better house of howard but like all 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.650
 you know and this we just leave it 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.599
 here inside 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.769
 and we already have our branch with the chrome 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.829
 would be missing the frog that someday the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.180
 we will do a cooking session with frog and 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.769
 Butter beer but good more 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.599
 go ahead let's focus on what 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.549
 It's our turn to get the bus ticket 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.530
 you do not angle is always the other way around 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.349
 night bus ticket we go to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 proceed to do it and now we see the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.370
 night bus ticket this goes to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 be cut and good when 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.040
 let's have clipped 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.040
 we follow 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 once we have it cut out this this 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.590
 It will be the result of our ticket 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.390
 our bus ticket calculation 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.879
 then what I said second before and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 the explained the poster I will leave under 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.030
 in the description a link so that what 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.739
 between May and you put it where you want 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.610
 Fram it and do what you want 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.099
 with him and good finally here we have 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.569
 today the signature dish box 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.030
 chocolate frogs that we are going to proceed 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.099
 to do it now too so there's no 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.590
 no loss and so you have left 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.920
 all right this model is not the one 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.510
 they sell in in the studios or the park 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.129
 Harry Potter's theme whatever this is 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.900
 is this is hollywood worth is supposed 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.650
 which is the one that is supposed to sell 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.970
 films 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 this is the container of frogs 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.569
 good chocolate and there we go with the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.760
 chocolate frogs box simply 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.849
 let's let's cut it all 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.069
 cut it all by all port by 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.349
 each line is worth every line less 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.180
 is the lines that give us out 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.709
 we are not going to cut them obviously we are going 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.640
 to simply cut everything else 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.640
 it's worth here 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.410
 well here we have cut the part 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.020
 front the back of the box 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.880
 of chocolate the top part we are going to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.620
 for the second one once we have the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.150
 second part will be like this and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.800
 now we will directly proceed to 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.440
 hit it good first we're going to 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.420
 start doubling for each line that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.330
 let's see here we're going to have to double 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.319
 this here is for every line that we see 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.170
 let's go doubling what 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.799
 in this part all this white 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.650
 we are going to fold it for each line 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.159
 for these here also those that have 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.900
 here until we have everything soft and 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.970
 We continue with the box once we have 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.349
 the two folded parts are going to 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.349
 to be a thing like that 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.730
 this is the bottom part of the frog 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.230
 you have to fold everything here as you see 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.080
 here 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.220
 here and here or between the three 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.220
 here it is 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.960
 so it's better to keep this 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.100
 small square 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.560
 so that this square is left and so 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.950
 in the top part simply the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.560
 we doubled everywhere 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.480
 we have it now let's proceed to 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.730
 paste it for that as always a simple 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.590
 bar glue will serve and you start to 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.740
 put glue on the parts these 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.090
 whites by the white eyelashes you go 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.340
 to start putting the glue once 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.410
 let's have one with glue put let's 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.900
 hitting the and so we will be more 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.880
 easy once we have it in the part of 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.810
 finished and past pasting 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.130
 to proceed to leave it a little bit so that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.020
 stand it for it to dry either a 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.120
 Once we have all the tabs pasted and 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.830
 are very dry we have it inside 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.790
 so on the outside it's going to be like that a little bit 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.130
 on point 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.810
 in pyramidal form you will see it here 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.940
 to be one that has no tabs and 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.040
 is going to be separated this is the one 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.030
 later we are going to stick to the part 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:48.140
 white below this will be stuck to this 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.150
 part of here to already form the box 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.000
 let's paste now the bottom part 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.710
 with the eyelashes remember that this is going to 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.730
 stay will not be straight at all 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.280
 it's going to look like a small 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.110
 tip when you unite lashes worth 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.520
 Well , we have finished the part of 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.540
 down here also you have 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.070
 how it has been 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.390
 you can see it's been like 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.390
 small edges on the sides 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.440
 and now the only thing we have to do 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.259
 is the part of the loose tab of 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.620
 above paste it on the white part of 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.630
 down or this would go here once 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.340
 stick this and I can already we will stay 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.590
 the perfect chocolate branch we put 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.940
 glue on the tab we look for the 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.160
 white 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.409
 where are you here and we're going to stick it to 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.759
 once she gets stuck 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:40.499
 we are going to be able to close the box and we 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.469
 is going to be the box of frogs 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:46.979
 chocolate then inside I'll leave them 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:50.289
 under some cards of magicians so that if 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.389
 you can put it inside already 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.349
 and good as I told you before one day 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.449
 we will also make the chocolate frogs 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.979
 to leave it inside or whatever it takes 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.899
 for now here we have the rule of 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.129
 Diagrammed chocolate good and up to here 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.349
 today's video I hope you have 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.930
 liked in the next week I think that 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.550
 I will talk about the week or day no no 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.289
 I know when I upload it in the next video 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.819
 I'm going to talk, I think of some character 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.979
 I've been told enough is to talk 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.749
 and well could one of them speak 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.520
 I also have other ideas in mind that 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.889
 little by little I will go up with the videos 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.199
 I'm going to make it clear spoilers and that's 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.360
 everything for today is worth we will see more 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.580
 see you next video give the x
