00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.300 

okay<00:00:05.050> so<00:00:05.110> we're<00:00:05.380> going<00:00:05.500> to<00:00:05.620> start<00:00:06.040> off<00:00:06.250> with

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
okay so we're going to start off with

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.730 
okay so we're going to start off with
some<00:00:06.970> curvy<00:00:07.540> lines<00:00:10.140> we're<00:00:11.140> going<00:00:11.350> to<00:00:11.410> do<00:00:11.530> two

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
some curvy lines we're going to do two

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.860 
some curvy lines we're going to do two
rows<00:00:11.980> of<00:00:12.220> them<00:00:12.340> try<00:00:12.850> and<00:00:12.880> keep<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.510> curves

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
rows of them try and keep the curves

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.279 
rows of them try and keep the curves
fairly<00:00:15.119> consistent<00:00:16.119> just<00:00:16.779> makes<00:00:16.960> it<00:00:17.109> a<00:00:17.140> little

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
fairly consistent just makes it a little

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.480 
fairly consistent just makes it a little
bit<00:00:17.439> easier<00:00:17.830> when<00:00:17.980> you're<00:00:18.130> drawing<00:00:18.340> the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
bit easier when you're drawing the

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.099 
bit easier when you're drawing the
pattern<00:00:18.789> when<00:00:19.000> you're<00:00:19.300> familiar<00:00:19.480> with<00:00:19.779> it<00:00:19.990> you

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
pattern when you're familiar with it you

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.189 
pattern when you're familiar with it you
can<00:00:20.320> vary<00:00:20.740> it<00:00:20.859> around<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:22.630> I'm<00:00:22.749> looking<00:00:23.019> for

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
can vary it around what I'm looking for

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.890 
can vary it around what I'm looking for
at<00:00:23.259> this<00:00:23.380> point<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.609> point<00:00:24.939> where<00:00:25.240> this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
at this point is the point where this

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.019 
at this point is the point where this
curve<00:00:26.289> starts<00:00:26.829> to<00:00:26.949> transition<00:00:27.400> to<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.699> next

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
curve starts to transition to the next

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.909 
curve starts to transition to the next
curve<00:00:28.269> so<00:00:28.539> sort<00:00:28.749> of<00:00:28.779> them<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.470> won't<00:00:29.650> always<00:00:29.829> be

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
curve so sort of them it won't always be

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.529 
curve so sort of them it won't always be
the<00:00:30.159> halfway<00:00:30.369> point<00:00:30.579> if<00:00:30.999> you've<00:00:31.089> got<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.300> long

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
the halfway point if you've got a long

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.100 
the halfway point if you've got a long
curve<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.790> know<00:00:33.940> just<00:00:34.239> where<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.570> starts

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
curve but you know just where it starts

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.380 
curve but you know just where it starts
to<00:00:35.260> change<00:00:35.500> try<00:00:36.039> and<00:00:36.190> find<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.579> point<00:00:37.059> and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
to change try and find that point and

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.869 
to change try and find that point and
you're<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.649> cross<00:00:38.949> over<00:00:39.250> your<00:00:39.609> lines

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
you're going to cross over your lines

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.150 
you're going to cross over your lines
there<00:00:40.329> okay<00:00:41.320> so<00:00:41.379> you're<00:00:41.680> not<00:00:41.769> going<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.010> draw

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
there okay so you're not going to draw

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.860 
there okay so you're not going to draw
that<00:00:42.219> on<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.879> could<00:00:43.090> if<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.300> wanted<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.840> I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
that on you could if you wanted to I

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.389 
that on you could if you wanted to I
suppose<00:00:44.320> but<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.480> know<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.719> should<00:00:46.899> be<00:00:47.019> fairly

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
suppose but you know it should be fairly

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.040 
suppose but you know it should be fairly
easy<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.640> pick<00:00:48.910> if<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.329> don't<00:00:49.809> get<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:50.019> right

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
easy to pick if you don't get it right

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.689 
easy to pick if you don't get it right
it<00:00:50.320> doesn't<00:00:50.469> matter<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:51.039> make<00:00:51.070> sure<00:00:51.399> all<00:00:51.670> of

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
it doesn't matter just make sure all of

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.639 
it doesn't matter just make sure all of
your<00:00:52.090> lines<00:00:52.329> cross<00:00:53.079> over<00:00:53.469> wherever<00:00:53.679> you<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
your lines cross over wherever you you

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
your lines cross over wherever you you
do<00:00:56.859> otherwise<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.489> going<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.760> look<00:00:57.879> untidy

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
do otherwise it's going to look untidy

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.700 
do otherwise it's going to look untidy
so<00:01:01.390> make<00:01:01.539> sure<00:01:01.570> they<00:01:01.839> all<00:01:01.989> cross<00:01:02.170> over<00:01:02.530> at<00:01:02.620> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
so make sure they all cross over at the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.870 
so make sure they all cross over at the
same<00:01:02.890> point<00:01:03.249> like<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.530> okay<00:01:05.530> next<00:01:06.400> one

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120 

I'm<00:01:13.420> trying<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.899> sell<00:01:14.110> my<00:01:14.140> new<00:01:14.409> drawing<00:01:14.680> board

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
I'm trying to sell my new drawing board

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.120 
I'm trying to sell my new drawing board
so<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.780> quite<00:01:17.350> comfortable<00:01:17.649> but<00:01:18.039> I've

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
so which is quite comfortable but I've

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.649 
so which is quite comfortable but I've
had<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.640> right<00:01:18.670> camera<00:01:19.149> angle<00:01:19.479> so

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
had to get the right camera angle so

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
had to get the right camera angle so
view<00:01:19.930> interesting<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.409> see<00:01:20.560> how<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.829> turns<00:01:21.100> out

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.969 

concentrating<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.049> little<00:01:26.259> bit<00:01:26.350> if<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.829> have

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
concentrating a little bit if you have

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.550 
concentrating a little bit if you have
to<00:01:27.100> kind<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.429> curve<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.969> in<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.780> cross<00:01:28.990> over<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
to kind of curve it in to cross over and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.410 
to kind of curve it in to cross over and
it<00:01:29.679> looks<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.070> bit<00:01:30.100> awkward<00:01:30.340> that's<00:01:30.729> fine<00:01:31.000> it's

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
it looks a bit awkward that's fine it's

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.289 
it looks a bit awkward that's fine it's
um<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:32.439> going<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:33.039> kind<00:01:33.789> of<00:01:33.939> add<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
um it's going to kind of add to the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.380 
um it's going to kind of add to the
pattern<00:01:34.600> anyway<00:01:34.929> I<00:01:34.990> think<00:01:35.789> next<00:01:36.789> we're<00:01:37.090> doing

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
pattern anyway I think next we're doing

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.279 
pattern anyway I think next we're doing
our<00:01:38.039> alternating<00:01:39.299> crossing<00:01:40.299> lines<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:40.990> we

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
our alternating crossing lines so we

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.100 
our alternating crossing lines so we
follow<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:42.819> shape<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> one<00:01:43.479> above<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
follow the shape of the one above and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.020 
follow the shape of the one above and
we've<00:01:44.950> got<00:01:45.099> to<00:01:45.220> do<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> full<00:01:46.860> s-curve<00:01:48.030> squeaky

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
we've got to do a full s-curve squeaky

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.660 
we've got to do a full s-curve squeaky
chair<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.450> between<00:01:49.810> there<00:01:50.130> okay<00:01:51.130> like<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.340> so

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
chair in between there okay like that so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.050 
chair in between there okay like that so
that's<00:01:51.789> a<00:01:52.030> curve<00:01:52.299> full<00:01:52.720> s-curve<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:54.580> back<00:01:54.909> out

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
that's a curve full s-curve and back out

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.359 
that's a curve full s-curve and back out
and<00:01:55.270> you'll<00:01:55.360> see<00:01:55.450> they<00:01:55.810> sort<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.110> follow<00:01:56.439> like

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and you'll see they sort of follow like

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.449 
and you'll see they sort of follow like
a<00:01:57.399> pinwheel<00:01:57.909> shape

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
a pinwheel shape

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.789 
a pinwheel shape
okay<00:02:00.459> so<00:02:01.149> then<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.599> skip<00:02:01.959> one<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.439> we<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.679> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
okay so then we skip one and we do the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.509 
okay so then we skip one and we do the
next<00:02:03.009> one<00:02:07.709> my<00:02:08.709> chair<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.160> wrong<00:02:09.310> way<00:02:09.459> is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
next one my chair in the wrong way is

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.740 
next one my chair in the wrong way is
weakened<00:02:10.299> like<00:02:10.479> mad<00:02:11.130> okay<00:02:12.130> so<00:02:13.000> let's<00:02:13.209> now<00:02:13.420> put

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
weakened like mad okay so let's now put

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.640 
weakened like mad okay so let's now put
the<00:02:14.160> echo<00:02:15.160> lines<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:16.350> again<00:02:17.350> crossing

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the echo lines on there again crossing

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:31.020 
the echo lines on there again crossing
over<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:19.200> transition<00:02:20.200> point

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:48.660 

okay<00:02:32.030> next<00:02:32.930> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.400 

okay<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.810> say<00:02:49.900> I've<00:02:49.990> gone<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> little

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
okay so you can say I've gone a little

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.320 
okay so you can say I've gone a little
bit<00:02:50.620> low<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.100> it's<00:02:51.280> better<00:02:51.520> if<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.120> get

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
bit low then it's better if you can get

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.710 
bit low then it's better if you can get
it<00:02:52.450> exactly<00:02:53.430> all<00:02:54.430> crossing<00:02:54.880> over<00:02:55.300> at<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> same

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
it exactly all crossing over at the same

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.980 
it exactly all crossing over at the same
point<00:02:56.020> um<00:02:56.800> okay<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:57.819> I've<00:02:58.180> done<00:02:58.390> my<00:02:58.450> cross

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
point um okay so I've done my cross

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.830 
point um okay so I've done my cross
lines<00:02:59.260> skipping<00:02:59.830> one<00:03:00.100> line<00:03:00.510> we'll<00:03:01.510> fill<00:03:01.690> them

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
lines skipping one line we'll fill them

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.870 
lines skipping one line we'll fill them
in<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.170> minute<00:03:02.440> next<00:03:02.830> we're<00:03:02.980> going<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
in a minute next we're going to do the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760 
in a minute next we're going to do the
downwards<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.900> again<00:03:05.170> we<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.650> do

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
downwards one and again we have to do

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.490 
downwards one and again we have to do
the<00:03:06.130> curve<00:03:06.310> at<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.640> start<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.570> the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the curve at the start so that it go the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.730 
the curve at the start so that it go the
shape<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.750> pinwheel<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.320> we've<00:03:11.530> got<00:03:11.650> to

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
shape of the pinwheel and we've got to

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.520 
shape of the pinwheel and we've got to
do<00:03:11.860> two<00:03:12.480> another<00:03:13.480> full<00:03:13.810> air<00:03:14.020> stroke<00:03:14.350> in

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
do two another full air stroke in

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.340 
do two another full air stroke in
between<00:03:14.830> each<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.280> okay<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.180> coming<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.870> here

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
between each one okay so coming in here

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.260 
between each one okay so coming in here
metaphor<00:03:18.250> let's<00:03:19.209> strike<00:03:19.630> down<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.230> next

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
metaphor let's strike down to the next

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.830 
metaphor let's strike down to the next
stroke<00:03:22.270> down<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> bottom<00:03:23.290> okay<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.630> let's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
stroke down to the bottom okay so let's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.199 
stroke down to the bottom okay so let's
halo<00:03:26.260> those<00:03:26.440> again<00:03:26.890> trying<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.400> cross<00:03:27.670> if<00:03:28.150> you

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
halo those again trying to cross if you

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.000 
halo those again trying to cross if you
get<00:03:28.540> interrupted<00:03:29.370> by<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.430> by<00:03:31.300> another<00:03:32.010> stroke

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
get interrupted by the by another stroke

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.280 
get interrupted by the by another stroke
just<00:03:33.250> lift<00:03:33.880> up<00:03:34.030> your<00:03:34.090> pen<00:03:34.769> try<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.920> follow<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
just lift up your pen try and follow the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.660 
just lift up your pen try and follow the
direction<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.190> going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.489> look

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
direction so that it's going to look

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.460 
direction so that it's going to look
smooth<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.959> can<00:03:40.989> do<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.500> by<00:03:41.739> just

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
smooth and you can do that by just

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.990 
smooth and you can do that by just
lifting<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.709> pen<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.070> imagine<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.850> you're

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
lifting a pen and imagine that you're

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.380 
lifting a pen and imagine that you're
continuing<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.840> line<00:03:47.140> along<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.150> what

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
continuing that line along this is what

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.729 
continuing that line along this is what
I<00:03:55.420> can<00:03:55.660> get<00:03:55.780> starts<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.140> little<00:03:56.200> cool<00:03:56.530> when

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
I can get starts a little cool when

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.720 
I can get starts a little cool when
you're<00:03:56.829> sort<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.100> getting<00:03:57.310> them<00:03:57.519> all

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
you're sort of getting them all

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.830 
you're sort of getting them all
overlapping<00:03:58.390> each<00:03:58.660> other<00:03:58.870> and<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.810> know

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
overlapping each other and you know

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.870 
overlapping each other and you know
touching<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.530> stuff<00:04:02.799> okay<00:04:03.459> now<00:04:03.670> we're<00:04:03.790> doing

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
touching and stuff okay now we're doing

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.330 
touching and stuff okay now we're doing
our<00:04:04.090> final<00:04:04.329> stroke<00:04:04.810> which<00:04:04.989> is<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.410> last<00:04:05.799> ones

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
our final stroke which is the last ones

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.850 
our final stroke which is the last ones
in<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.360> direction<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.049> we've<00:04:08.170> got<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.709> do

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
in this direction and we've got to to do

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.039 
in this direction and we've got to to do
this<00:04:09.549> time<00:04:09.850> because<00:04:10.150> we've<00:04:10.299> already<00:04:10.570> filled

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
this time because we've already filled

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.810 
this time because we've already filled
in<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.230> middle<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:11.709> we<00:04:12.010> actually<00:04:12.400> only<00:04:12.579> have

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
in that middle one we actually only have

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.970 
in that middle one we actually only have
to<00:04:12.910> do<00:04:13.030> one<00:04:13.390> curb<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.230> not<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.380> full<00:04:14.680> s

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
to do one curb so it's not a full s

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.840 
to do one curb so it's not a full s
shape<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:17.440> between<00:04:17.470> each<00:04:18.070> intersection<00:04:18.430> so

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
shape in between each intersection so

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.580 
shape in between each intersection so
we're<00:04:18.970> just<00:04:19.150> doing<00:04:19.239> one<00:04:19.630> because<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.079> we

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
we're just doing one because if we

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.930 
we're just doing one because if we
hadn't<00:04:20.890> have<00:04:20.979> done<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.190> line<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.729> would<00:04:21.850> have

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
hadn't have done that line it would have

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.110 
hadn't have done that line it would have
been<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> full<00:04:22.830> s-shaped<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:25.000> we've

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
been a full s-shaped like that but we've

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.900 
been a full s-shaped like that but we've
got<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.450> line<00:04:25.660> in<00:04:25.900> there<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.700> following<00:04:27.700> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
got that line in there so following the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.390 
got that line in there so following the
curve<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> previous<00:04:29.350> one<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:29.860> we've<00:04:30.370> just

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
curve of the previous one so we've just

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.110 
curve of the previous one so we've just
got<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.880> go<00:04:31.000> from<00:04:31.270> here<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.960> here<00:04:32.850> then<00:04:33.850> from

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
got to go from here to here then from

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:42.980 
got to go from here to here then from
there<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:36.250> there<00:04:36.570> okay

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.890 

oops

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
oops

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.909 
oops
stop

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.989 

and<00:04:49.919> they<00:04:50.039> said<00:04:50.249> the<00:04:50.339> ones<00:04:50.490> where<00:04:50.639> I<00:04:50.699> think<00:04:50.789> you

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:50.999 
and they said the ones where I think you

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.159 
and they said the ones where I think you
can<00:04:51.029> kind<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.509> make<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.689> little<00:04:51.899> bit<00:04:52.050> more

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
can kind of make a little bit more

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.600 
can kind of make a little bit more
traumatic<00:04:52.649> because<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:53.159> is<00:04:53.279> your<00:04:53.429> final

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
traumatic because this is your final

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.329 
traumatic because this is your final
line<00:04:53.939> you<00:04:54.119> don't<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.509> worry<00:04:54.659> about<00:04:55.339> not

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:56.339 
line you don't have to worry about not

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.129 
line you don't have to worry about not

crowding<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.860> up<00:04:58.979> too<00:04:59.159> much<00:04:59.309> you<00:04:59.369> can<00:04:59.669> fill<00:04:59.909> in

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.059 
crowding it up too much you can fill in

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:05.540 
crowding it up too much you can fill in
some<00:05:00.089> of<00:05:00.389> that<00:05:00.449> extra<00:05:00.899> space<00:05:03.889> okay<00:05:04.889> what<00:05:05.520> I

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
some of that extra space okay what I

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.799 
some of that extra space okay what I
like<00:05:05.789> about<00:05:05.939> this<00:05:06.179> because<00:05:06.330> you're<00:05:06.509> doing<00:05:06.629> it

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:06.809 
like about this because you're doing it

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.449 
like about this because you're doing it
in<00:05:06.959> the<00:05:07.020> layers<00:05:07.259> is<00:05:07.619> these<00:05:07.949> ones<00:05:08.189> that<00:05:08.279> we're

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:08.459 
in the layers is these ones that we're

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.249 
in the layers is these ones that we're
doing<00:05:08.580> now<00:05:08.699> a<00:05:09.029> period<00:05:09.419> should<00:05:09.569> be<00:05:09.629> sitting

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
doing now a period should be sitting

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.739 
doing now a period should be sitting
further<00:05:10.619> back<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.279> the<00:05:11.339> design<00:05:11.759> okay<00:05:12.449> this<00:05:12.629> the

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
further back in the design okay this the

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.570 
further back in the design okay this the
last<00:05:12.959> one<00:05:13.110> across<00:05:13.469> here<00:05:13.529> so<00:05:13.770> they're<00:05:14.249> going<00:05:14.369> in

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
last one across here so they're going in

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.699 
last one across here so they're going in
that<00:05:14.759> direction

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:15.709 
that direction

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.589 
that direction
so<00:05:16.709> remember<00:05:17.009> it's<00:05:17.159> only<00:05:17.279> one<00:05:17.729> curve<00:05:18.149> in

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
so remember it's only one curve in

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.469 
so remember it's only one curve in
between<00:05:18.719> each<00:05:19.379> of<00:05:19.679> those<00:05:20.580> intersections<00:05:21.300> this

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
between each of those intersections this

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.799 
between each of those intersections this
time<00:05:21.719> every<00:05:22.409> other<00:05:22.499> time<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.979> was<00:05:23.009> two<00:05:23.809> this

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:24.809 
time every other time it was two this

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:43.100 
time every other time it was two this
time<00:05:25.080> it's<00:05:25.379> just<00:05:25.769> one

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.290 

okay<00:05:44.110> that's<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.280> easy<00:05:45.940> stuff<00:05:46.330> see<00:05:47.110> ya
