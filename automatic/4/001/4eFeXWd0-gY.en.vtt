 megapixels in the front and a battery of 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.300
 2 me 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.790
 the 2000-2002 1550 mignan father he can 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.840
 recharge also via induction the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 problem if you want it is that I 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.720
 the impression that it is a technology 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 they say that they are compatible with 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 all the standards but in fact I have 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.810
 especially tried their pad there with me 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 my nexus 5 compatible chi it worked 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.570
 not so I 'll have to dig that I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 am not exactly on two holds 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.120
 techno it uses and so we will spend 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.940
 about the design of this product so you 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.620
 have the camera the ola finally the exit 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.420
 front camera with audio output 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.870
 some sensors it's a product that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.910
 is aluminum with slices 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.400
 rounded that way there that would celebrate 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.590
 think of a certain high product 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.720
 smartphone of another brand well 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.020
 known that I'm going to quote who's called 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.420
 apple what we do not care it's true on 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.970
 the right one on the panahov glass 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 lock unlock the possibility 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.560
 to put the summit of course down so 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.850
 the speaker want to see something 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 sonia will show something in a 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.840
 moment go now it's gone hop 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.660
 here you have seen so next it's 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.660
 the iphone 6 1 for info micro usb jack 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.870
 micro infrared volume at the back in 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 is a glass shell which is rather 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.380
 nice that is flat but with lo 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.940
 the optics that come out like that or that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 please, but it's the camera 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.400
 who is right there at the little better yes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.880
 it's clever finally image stabilization 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.630
 Optical and cardio frequency meter then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.280
 we will quickly go through the interface 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.720
 have as I told you to break 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.580
 during a more complete overview 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.260
 this terminal there actually it has the same 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.670
 overlay than the hedge except that it did not 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.910
 not all the features related to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.910
 ages 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.170
 so here I am going to drop a tiny 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.170
 little similar brightness there is a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.570
 a little strange light here that's see 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.670
 well then we find this same 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.290
 same color, then that makes it blue 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.840
 ah it's not at all that's turquoise 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.980
 in fact and it's it's this on 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.830
 what the famous turquoise 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 knew that we know about those on 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.090
 the touchwiz roof that is not 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.569
 inevitably something that we appreciate 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.620
 but it depends on marked 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.280
 these are the icons that do not look 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280
 to have changed 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.109
 the screen which is very very nice 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.310
 very very beautiful screen is a very very 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 beautiful screen level taken in hand 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.280
 Besides, it's very comfortable 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.689
 we do not find this sensation 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.889
 plastic in fact we have a mix between 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.230
 aluminum and glass 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.359
 it's a bit of a mix between du du 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.689
 apple and sony if you see what I 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.609
 means 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.730
 and it's not bad at all it's not bad 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.530
 at all we have the menu here with all your 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.730
 the apps I will launch you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.389
 some interface that you see in 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.010
 outline 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:58.239
 and then we'll come back to that in the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.290
 detail soon so here are the 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.319
 contacts here is not bad device 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.129
 very fast photo you saw the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.739
 capture it's kind of nice that she's 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:17.189
 a frontal and we can take a picture 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.189
 with the heart rate monitor I believe 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.620
 this is actually your head 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.900
 be detected that's where he is the catch 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.430
 and my cup of cake like that and you 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.320
 have different modes there we will look at that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.720
 in another video do not worry 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.740
 it was just broadly 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.290
 it is a product that I find nice 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.840
 honestly we were waiting for a product from 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.670
 home to home samsung aluminum was 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.920
 had the alpha there was something 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.780
 more rounded to you to tell me if that 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.380
 please or not and then leave a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.100
 little comment 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.100
 and I tell you see you soon
