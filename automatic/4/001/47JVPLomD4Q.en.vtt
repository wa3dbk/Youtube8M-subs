very nice it's a nice little cherry on
top<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.079> everything<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:35.160> already<00:00:35.340> knew<00:00:35.550> they

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
top of everything they already knew they

were in and things like that and that
gives<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:38.010> i<00:00:38.100> guess<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:39.000> time<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.280> maybe

something else into the mix but what I
really<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> touch<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> fact

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
really want to touch on here is the fact

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.080 
really want to touch on here is the fact
that<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.829> went<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> jogger<00:00:47.550> mock-up

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that they went for this jogger mock-up

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
that they went for this jogger mock-up
right<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.570> we've<00:00:48.750> seen<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> lot<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.289> Korea

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
right which we've seen a lot in Korea

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.779 
right which we've seen a lot in Korea
haven't<00:00:50.700> seen<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.840> yet<00:00:52.110> but

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
haven't seen out here just yet but

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
haven't seen out here just yet but
increasingly<00:00:53.789> prevalent<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> such<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
increasingly prevalent as it is such a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
increasingly prevalent as it is such a
tank<00:00:55.980> heavy<00:00:56.250> meta<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.210> allows<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
tank heavy meta and it allows you to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
tank heavy meta and it allows you to
shred<00:00:58.050> tanks<00:00:59.149> ya<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.710> look<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.129> time

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
shred tanks ya you look all the time

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
shred tanks ya you look all the time
like<00:01:02.699> halfway<00:01:02.940> through<00:01:03.300> Toby<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:03.899> ready<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like halfway through Toby was ready to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070 
like halfway through Toby was ready to
serve<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.119> important<00:01:06.900> point

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
serve it's a really important point

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.830 
serve it's a really important point
because<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.130> probably<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.479> strongest

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
because this is probably the strongest

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.120 
because this is probably the strongest
comp<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> current

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
comp that you can have in the current

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
comp that you can have in the current
meta<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.260> their

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
meta so they have to have this in their

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
meta so they have to have this in their
repertoire<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:14.040> you're<00:01:14.340> heading<00:01:14.580> to

international competition and turtle is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
international competition and turtle is
a<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.979> big<00:01:17.159> part<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:17.790> kisum<00:01:18.450> have

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
a really big part of that now kisum have

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.510 
a really big part of that now kisum have
played<00:01:19.020> protect<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> hyper<00:01:19.950> carry<00:01:20.250> comes

played protect the hyper carry comes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
played protect the hyper carry comes
before<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.420> always<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.930> tristana

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
before but they always use like tristana

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.609 
before but they always use like tristana
or<00:01:22.680> jinx<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> turtle<00:01:24.869> being<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.290> comfortable

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
or jinx so turtle being very comfortable

on<00:01:25.680> cog<00:01:25.890> might<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.400> important

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
on cog might think is very important

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
on cog might think is very important
because<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.390> reason<00:01:27.570> kog'maw<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> best

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
because the reason kog'maw is the best

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
because the reason kog'maw is the best

you soup up a hyper carry is because he

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
you soup up a hyper carry is because he

in<00:02:01.530> Turtles<00:02:02.070> ability<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> him<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.299> be

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in Turtles ability to do it him to be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.480 
in Turtles ability to do it him to be
that<00:02:03.570> hyper<00:02:03.869> carry<00:02:04.200> himself<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.280> think

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that hyper carry himself I don't think

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.039 
that hyper carry himself I don't think
so<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.329> great<00:02:06.600> mid<00:02:06.840> laner

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so i think it's just a great mid laner

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
so i think it's just a great mid laner
at<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.350> moment<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.009> being<00:02:08.190> played

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
at this moment I think it's being played

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
at this moment I think it's being played
a<00:02:08.459> lot<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> world<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:10.170> arson<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
a lot around the world and be arson was

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
a lot around the world and be arson was
showing<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.970> said<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.360> he<00:02:12.390> can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
showing that like you said that he can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
showing that like you said that he can
acta<00:02:13.560> sees<00:02:13.740> champion<00:02:14.160> six<00:02:14.400> days<00:02:14.580> bring<00:02:15.120> them

out<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.600> also<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.380> think<00:02:16.500> Santorin<00:02:17.070> was<00:02:17.220> really

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.400 
out and also I think Santorin was really
good<00:02:17.610> insurance<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.450> having<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.020> ap
