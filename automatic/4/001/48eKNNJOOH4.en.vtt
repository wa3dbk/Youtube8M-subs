00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and we are always here with astro between 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.899
 episode 3 as I said 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 in the previous episode 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.590
 I'm trying to reach that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.870
 meteorite had joined her with so many cubes 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 of mud and shit 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.560
 yes especially as a background shit torches 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 to illuminate the meteorites we stand on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 already already been then last 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.890
 calculations will be enough a jump in just here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.890
 to get to our house 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.050
 that's the thing we need to achieve 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 so let's go a bit like a saint but not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.879
 you can get there then I started a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.809
 build the tower of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.809
 earth blocks 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.170
 here the mouse guy impalla that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.100
 cabbage and come on but if one builds one 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.100
 at a time how I do it 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.100
 let's move on to three at a time 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 meanwhile it's what's getting closer and closer 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 you know where he is not very close by now 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.729
 still a little but it's difficult 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.140
 very difficult to explore in space and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.140
 cabbage and ke cabbage 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.520
 now we almost have to be I don't know 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.310
 how hard is the rock of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.650
 space for other small various things 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.990
 etc. so now we'll see a little 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.990
 together we are almost there 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 almost come 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.490
 I just killed a little st column 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.490
 of shit 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:27.670
 ok now let's get closer to the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:32.590
 as possible to the meteorite is over there e 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:38.230
 we are yes I know I'm not commenting 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.180
 just fine we even got out of the dai 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.870
 we are very close with a lot of land 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:49.750
 so I don't know what I'm doing today 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.230
 we will explore that we will explore some of 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.720
 geberit asteroids and oriti what the fuck 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.390
 fucking asteroids really not enough now 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.569
 I'm confusing too much and the sixth 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.749
 becoming me of it 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.749
 from 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.040
 They are anywhere near the racist 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.980
 first time I'm exploring that 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.340
 I'm going on a meteorite in survival 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.349
 so the experiences are trying us 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.480
 that's what I'm trying too 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:32.700
 the same close enough to me to be a little not 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.700
 kill us a few blocks if not 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.690
 here you don't go anywhere 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.480
 yet 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.640
 a few more security blocks either 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.290
 maybe a vote now yes you do 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.370
 pretty much give you another block 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.370
 know at 32 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.370
 here 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.500
 come on we land on the first meteorite from 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.850
 so much but so let's try it immediately though 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.850
 quite hard I have to say 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.060
 Enough of hours he didn't give us shit 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.840
 ok perfect to get I learned the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.210
 lesson to get the thing is rock 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.449
 here you have to put small steel if 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.020
 there is no back lighting the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.470
 meteorite a rock with torches for 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.479
 make it clear that I've been here before 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.479
 michele su try in safe area 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.870
 I don't know it better than we do anyway 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.220
 meanwhile we landed on a meteorite 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:13.510
 But it is one thing when I had a thousand 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.510
 close to this it is very similar 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.419
 what is far away from me 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.050
 guys wo n't take a while to 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.990
 reach a good land that we are 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.780
 equal height of the myth and ritual and I would say 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.130
 flint jumper and visit him 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.130
 it was n't already going to end on the ground 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:04.080
 ok come on let's go old 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:07.009
 I point we are going go if not 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.009
 very close by now 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.210
 the other is good I am just a meteorite 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.670
 instead look here now we have 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.980
 also reached the second meteorite 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.990
 meteorite you are saying right with 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.990
 Steroids as I was always wrong before 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:43.580
 is we also illuminate this one feels a 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.580
 some of this 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.810
 against 38 distant a football field 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:57.729
 perfect temporary and lasted a while 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:03.580
 a little before we found the 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:05.650
 way to reach some meteorites 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:10.870
 well today we'll come back later went 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.940
 we will have the pick 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.169
 but now we glide on our base 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.169
 using the landing strip 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:35.960
 after so many heads it means however we have 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.699
 reached two meteorites we also have 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.110
 discovered that you can't do that 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:43.550
 wait at the rock without you can't 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.050
 get the rock without a little e 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.229
 bracelets first then we'll see about 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.009
 do another little thing at home well there 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.009
 see you next time
