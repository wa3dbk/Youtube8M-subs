00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.140
 on cooling after the few hot 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.120
 many have been waiting days that they have 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.250
 again as hard as it already was 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
 before the Whitsun weekend in some 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.640
 regions of the weimarer land and the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.580
 circle saalfeld rudolstadt 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.470
 nobody would have expected that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.170
 less minutes the brown broth shot 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.360
 in bad berkas streets and flooded the 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.010
 Lower town came out 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.420
 direction deep pits roll the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.909
 water masses over the fields 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.289
 condensed into trenches and so took 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.839
 the mischief runs its course 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.659
 everything that was not anchored firmly enough 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.249
 or just be swept up to be around 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.010
 have and bring good security 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:47.559
 or a few are sandbags to stack 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 no bad berkas mayor volker 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.420
 skull just can not believe it 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 but so far as a disgusting flood 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.860
 Now, as I said, of a few hours 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.470
 completely land under so werke Ortsteil 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.580
 merfeld gutendorf overburdens everything 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 and you arrived outside 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.490
 many bad berka wanted their eyes 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.530
 not trust 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.810
 they wondered where so much water 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.970
 ever made that happen quickly 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.890
 rumored the round 1 equal to a small one 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.030
 congestion is between bad berka and deep 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.850
 dug was broken 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.740
 But that was not so many villages in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.750
 room central thuringia and also in parts 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.060
 East Thuringia felt in time 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.220
 put back by a few weeks ago as 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.619
 the flood started and everything 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.509
 destroyed similarly probably have to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.960
 the kurstädter felt this evening 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.970
 to have 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.300
 because after the first flood through the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.039
 A small town had rolled 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:50.500
 this time out direction gutendorf 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.570
 that he totally comes so fast that before 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 you do not go that fast with your quad 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.250
 can help and believe because as I said 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.539
 he was a little bit demanding woman and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.539
 then suddenly the second wave came 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.380
 as robo again and if you 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 ever go something like that and the same 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 again probably not so well the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.750
 All night because we really wanted 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.040
 then for the waterworks times 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.989
 5000 drop out and filmmaking because 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.349
 you just can not help us anymore 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.940
 want to be made strong around the world 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.560
 the water is already out of the streets 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.750
 had retired grabbed the bad 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.000
 berka shared with cellars and houses 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.069
 were pumped dry mud and read along 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.110
 Snow shovels driven out of the alleys 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.110
 they probably survived it now 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.330
 while living at erfurt in linda 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 bach or with münchholzhausen still with 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.299
 all forces against the renewed 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.299
 water masses is being fought
