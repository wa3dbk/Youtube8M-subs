00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 and what's up guys 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.510
 I am already here and as you will have been able 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.070
 see in the video this week we're going to 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.950
 talk about the 10 things that I know about 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.470
 starbucks and you have not gotten the pisto and 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.090
 let's go for it the first thing that you 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.310
 I bring that you do not know and I do 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.369
 obviously you are working on going 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.170
 for six years 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.090
 followed six years that are said soon 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.560
 This may be crazy to you 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.779
 you will ask what the hell you did during 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.550
 six years in starbucks really what 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.989
 I did was have a pretty good time 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.280
 in and out when I wanted to change 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.239
 my schedules so I've worked 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.950
 fairly good 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.750
 in fact he worked in that cojones 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.969
 he worked for milk 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.350
 I had my 51 days of vacation and the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.480
 truth is that there was a year in which 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.090
 they accumulated vacations and I think I had a 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.160
 basic assistant, I was the most 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.739
 of vacation time almost a week 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.020
 per month that is, this was quite 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.579
 cojonudo me well with people with whom 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.110
 I worked and especially with Marists and 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.610
 supervisors then if you were lucky 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.469
 to get along with hector manager was 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.059
 the milk and if you had then the luck and 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.460
 amazing to get along with you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.260
 a manager was already the crack point the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.480
 second thing that possibly you 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.060
 do not know and I do know that all cups 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.070
 starbucks which we all talk about and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.380
 which we have all ever stolen 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.410
 the houses cost them 40 miserable 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.120
 cents to was I would even swear that it is 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.280
 somewhat smaller as it is possible that people 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.290
 serves lances you're throwing and it seems like a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.820
 real tongue but there is no problem 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 I can take you a cup, see a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.690
 starbucks petado and take a cup 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.430
 even go to the starbucks closet 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.200
 where they have all the cups and when 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.790
 this is petado up you take a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.320
 cup and you take it quietly as 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.730
 if nothing had happened, people would 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.650
 Take the raisins and it does not happen 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.650
 absolutely nothing so you do not 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.330
 worry take the quietly the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.970
 third thing that you possibly do not 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.440
 you know and me if it's the starbucks at the end 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.960
 from the bar there is a table called 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.170
 eating table where there is sugar 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.210
 bring bills and different syrups in 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.800
 dust formerly there were two jugs one 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.110
 of semi-skimmed milk and milk 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.580
 skim cool this was to fill 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.140
 of a little bit the drink or to 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.460
 put a little cold milk to your 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.840
 life that maybe was a bit more 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.300
 hot in Spain supposedly 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 they removed these milk jugs because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.890
 they said that they expired that they smelled bad and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.610
 could you put bad I will tell you that this is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.560
 totally true 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.820
 they have been removed only in Spain- 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.070
 they have simply removed because in 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.020
 Spain we are a few crappy and everything that 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.150
 they give us for free we abuse it the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.190
 kids came asking for a glass 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.110
 the milk is the overturned 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.180
 chocolate syrup were spinning and 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.190
 they already had their milk with here what 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.660
 we abuse it like some 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.700
 bastards we are not ashamed 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.560
 do these things so good what 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.300
 they ended up removing because in Spain we are 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 so crappy or so smart is the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.990
 fourth thing that maybe you do not know and I do 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.810
 is that once they put me some 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.459
 claims for being too much and don and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.350
 this friends is totally uncertain 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.040
 because they were the ones who linked 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.930
 with you not me 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 I'm going to tell you, I was the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.489
 clients who wrote a letter to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.829
 my pretty big boss which I could 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.659
 read since I at the bar did not stop 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.489
 flirt with the girls the fact is that I 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.019
 I read the letter and at first I feel a 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.420
 little bad but then I found it quite 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.010
 funny I think I discovered who they were 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 the customers and in fact every time 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.700
 they came they looked at me like saying you 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 you know it and I looked at them like 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.049
 saying I know and you are a little 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.700
 fuckers at the end I treated them with 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.829
 good vibes this was my way of working 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.389
 and well if I gave in this case not because 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.670
 that some of you do not know 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.459
 you will know next thing that you do not 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.439
 you knew and I know if this is that the aunts more 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.109
 interesting have been days that I've 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.780
 known directly in this the fourth 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.500
 thing that I did not know impossible to be a 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.600
 bit true 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.470
 they are the sixth thing that maybe you do not know 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.870
 and I do the starbucks book of our 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.880
 Dear Howard and I will tell you in the book 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.230
 there are interesting things that 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.390
 they have to do totally with the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.760
 marketing and how to be more earns thousands of 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.530
 million dollars a year the title of 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.330
 this book is like starbucks a lot for 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.270
 your life without losing your soul 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.730
 this is a total hoax in the year 2009 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.590
 the vips group bought starbucks there 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.630
 the nightmare began for people who 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.880
 he worked he was reduced the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.220
 Salaries reduced working hours 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.200
 the vacation days were reduced to 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.570
 take the companionship and the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.690
 drinks went to hell all the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 quality of starbucks extended 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 remarkably however in all this 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.890
 those above have to keep charging 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.690
 the same shit and the ones below are going to 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.700
 keep charging the same shit or maybe 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.440
 less always they sold that were between 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.840
 one of the 75 best companies for 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.030
 work group vips does not have a fucking 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.810
 hard starbucks has been falling with them 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.810
 etc etc 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 the seventh thing that you 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.030
 you do not know directly and I do 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.310
 that little cold thing with a little white thing 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.620
 above carrying a straw and a glass 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.720
 transparent and it's cold as well as a 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.720
 milkshake is called frappuccino 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.850
 the eighth thing that maybe you do not 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.560
 you know and I know that for a long time 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.250
 in the store where I worked was the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.650
 dj the stars male if I got to hack 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.960
 the music amplification system 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.759
 I put a cable and even on my ipod and the 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.350
 year that the music played the bosses the 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.759
 truth is that they did not even know 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.350
 some of them had to puncture me 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.910
 music because the music thread downloads 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.220
 I will tell you that it was fine will weigh a 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.500
 little bit almost not so in all this was 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.810
 the me who pirated the music and put 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:37.090
 to rock and roll soul funk hits 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.919
 blues funk punk funk mola let me go the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.479
 People appreciated him because there were people 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.160
 which went very well and people 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.720
 singing inside starbucks has me 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.310
 come people saying that the music that 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.840
 had in starbucks was fucking mother was 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.880
 I the one who played her has played a lot 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.740
 because when the chiefs came, he had to 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.090
 make authentic juggling to remove it 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.650
 and this caused people to rise 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.690
 much more drinks and that the ways 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.639
 were more available to flirt with 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.500
 us because they asked how 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.720
 they called these subjects 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.880
 It was like rock and roll starbucks 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.710
 hall of fame and the people were in the 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.110
 terrace enjoying the rock and roll 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.390
 of the funk of soul with good weather I 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.340
 I played but it worked out pretty well 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.870
 the ninth thing I am going to give it to you 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.340
 because maybe many of you if the 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.280
 spice is that you can not take 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.740
 tattoos on starbucks and I friends have 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.540
 taken this tattoo in starbucks to 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.400
 air during all the time that I've 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.990
 worked there but I jumped by the 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.580
 bullfighter this is something that perhaps is a 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.620
 foolishness but for me it was not because 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.900
 I had to put on an uncomfortable hip 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.640
 when a boss came to catch me 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.590
 tattoos was a pain in the ass with which 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.080
 during my starbucks stage I took the 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.180
 tattoo in the air and a hundred times all 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.740
 I did this during my time in 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.110
 starbucks and since I entered was 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.850
 forbidden but I could always jump 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.530
 the rule to the bullfighter this when when 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.060
 came the bosses it's true that I 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.660
 they called attention many times but 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.090
 It never happened and nothing beyond the tenth 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.580
 which you surely do not know 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.650
 at all and I do have sex in 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.450
 the bathroom of the employees not 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.970
 cool nothing and less with the light off 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.350
 because I'm saying this shit to this 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.510
 I leave it there for you to think about it 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.070
 Maybe it's a lie 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.020
 and up to here the 10 things that 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.730
 probably you did not know and I did 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.200
 these things I just wanted them 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.300
