00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
everything in the path instead of just

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.820 
everything in the path instead of just
attaching<00:01:10.360> everything<00:01:11.110> into<00:01:11.320> like<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.560> giant

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
attaching everything into like a giant

circle and our giant ball rather and you
also<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:17.460> puzzle<00:01:18.460> elements<00:01:18.610> thrown<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.360> here

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
but at its core it is indeed a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.060

platformer and like I say for the eight

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.370 
platformer and like I say for the eight
dollar<00:01:24.430> asking<00:01:25.000> price<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.660> thing<00:01:25.930> is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
attached to this because we originally

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.380 
attached to this because we originally
given<00:01:31.180> one<00:01:31.630> code<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:32.260> gave<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.180> Steven<00:01:34.180> who

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
given one code that I gave to Steven who

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.420 
given one code that I gave to Steven who
just<00:01:34.750> posted<00:01:35.230> his<00:01:35.380> video<00:01:35.590> review<00:01:36.070> for<00:01:36.100> this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
just posted his video review for this

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.660 
just posted his video review for this
and<00:01:37.410> his<00:01:38.410> initial<00:01:38.830> reaction<00:01:39.220> was<00:01:39.280> like<00:01:39.460> aya

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
and his initial reaction was like aya

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.190 
and his initial reaction was like aya
whatever<00:01:40.120> it's<00:01:40.360> all<00:01:40.540> right<00:01:40.690> it's<00:01:40.870> just<00:01:40.960> so

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
whatever it's all right it's just so

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.540 
whatever it's all right it's just so
basic<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:41.980> basic<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.890> actually

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
basic it's so basic and then I actually

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.430 
basic it's so basic and then I actually
had<00:01:45.880> another<00:01:46.090> code<00:01:46.360> because<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.050> company

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
had another code because the company

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.660 
had another code because the company
told<00:01:47.650> me<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.760> was

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
told me that it was

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.130 
told me that it was
it<00:01:49.909> was<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.150> glitched<00:01:50.450> or<00:01:50.689> something<00:01:50.960> like<00:01:51.080> that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
it was a glitched or something like that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.460 
it was a glitched or something like that
so<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.560> entered<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.189> code<00:01:52.369> figure<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.909> that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
so I entered the code figure in that

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.740 
so I entered the code figure in that
whatever<00:01:54.470> would<00:01:54.740> be<00:01:54.920> would<00:01:55.610> be<00:01:55.759> okay<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.299> it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
whatever would be would be okay but it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.510 
whatever would be would be okay but it
turns<00:01:56.900> out<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.110> both<00:01:57.320> codes<00:01:57.710> worked<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.250> then

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
turns out that both codes worked so then

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.330 
turns out that both codes worked so then
I<00:01:58.909> just<00:01:59.060> automatically<00:02:00.009> jumped<00:02:01.009> on<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
I just automatically jumped on in the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.690 
I just automatically jumped on in the
game<00:02:01.490> got<00:02:01.880> hooked<00:02:02.570> immediately<00:02:03.250> told<00:02:04.250> Stephen

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
game got hooked immediately told Stephen

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.389 
game got hooked immediately told Stephen
that<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.939> was<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> moron<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:06.100> saying<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.220> was

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
that it was a moron for saying that was

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.219 
that it was a moron for saying that was
so<00:02:07.520> basic<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.479> he<00:02:08.569> was<00:02:08.600> right<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.110> he

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
so basic but he was right and he

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.510 
so basic but he was right and he
actually<00:02:09.380> brings<00:02:09.770> up<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> only

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
actually brings up one of the only

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.680 
running my that is like basically use
like<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.000> gyroscope<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:30.740> gameplay<00:04:31.690> there's

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
like the gyroscope for gameplay there's

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.140

something<00:04:33.080> wrong<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.830> first<00:04:34.550> level<00:04:34.940> I

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
thing around and go through a little

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.230 
thing around and go through a little
labyrinth<00:04:45.349> to<00:04:45.650> get<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.099> ball<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.820> a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
labyrinth to get you the ball to a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.700 
labyrinth to get you the ball to a
desired<00:04:47.690> position<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.349> there's<00:04:48.500> little

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
desired position and there's little

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.110 
desired position and there's little
holes<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.130> your<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.370> ball<00:04:49.550> could<00:04:49.729> get<00:04:49.880> stuck

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
holes that your the ball could get stuck

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.379 
holes that your the ball could get stuck
in<00:04:50.300> well<00:04:50.870> it's<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.050> same<00:04:51.080> exact<00:04:51.560> idea<00:04:52.009> and<00:04:52.389> I

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
in well it's the same exact idea and I

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.110

find that they pull you right into the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.939 
find that they pull you right into the
hole<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.570> some<00:04:56.780> odd<00:04:56.930> reason<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.440> it's<00:04:57.710> only

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
hole for some odd reason but it's only

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.830 
hole for some odd reason but it's only
that<00:04:58.220> very<00:04:58.430> first<00:04:58.820> one<00:04:59.030> all<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.389> rest<00:04:59.570> work
