model then than any other and I think

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
model then than any other and I think
really<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> reason<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.899> than

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
really the reason for that is other than

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.799 
really the reason for that is other than
the<00:00:55.230> tremendous<00:00:56.010> quality<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> CMC<00:00:57.600> does

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the tremendous quality that CMC does

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
the tremendous quality that CMC does
with<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.800> they're<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with it is that they're really the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
with it is that they're really the
mystique<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.329> surrounds<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> auto<00:01:01.440> unions

mystique that surrounds the auto unions

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.039

fantastic<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.680> great<00:02:08.009> great<00:02:08.670> detail<00:02:09.149> if

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
fantastic that's a great great detail if

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.949 
fantastic that's a great great detail if
we<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:11.069> front<00:02:11.400> suspension<00:02:11.959> you

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
we look at the the front suspension you

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
we look at the the front suspension you
can<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.590> we've

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
can see that we've

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.710 
can see that we've
got<00:02:14.690> great<00:02:15.690> big<00:02:15.959> huge<00:02:16.709> drum<00:02:17.580> brakes<00:02:17.940> with

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
got great big huge drum brakes with

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.780 
got great big huge drum brakes with
nicely<00:02:19.200> fabricated<00:02:20.330> sheetmetal<00:02:21.330> scoops<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
nicely fabricated sheetmetal scoops and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.190 
nicely fabricated sheetmetal scoops and
as<00:02:23.790> I'll<00:02:24.000> move<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.569> other<00:02:24.660> side<00:02:24.930> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
as I'll move over to the other side we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
as I'll move over to the other side we
can<00:02:25.290> look<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.730> dr.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
can look it is you can see that dr.

Ferdinand<00:02:27.569> Porsche<00:02:27.959> really<00:02:28.410> had<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> lot<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.800> do

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
Ferdinand Porsche really had a lot to do

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440 
Ferdinand Porsche really had a lot to do
with<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.250> design<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.760> car<00:02:29.819> because<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
with the design of this car because it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.020 
with the design of this car because it
it's<00:02:30.959> very<00:02:31.500> reminiscent<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> Volkswagen<00:02:32.550> or

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's very reminiscent of a Volkswagen or

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's very reminiscent of a Volkswagen or
a<00:02:33.090> Porsche<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.720> its<00:02:33.870> torsion<00:02:34.410> bar<00:02:34.650> front

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
a Porsche with its torsion bar front

a Porsche with its torsion bar front
suspension<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.720> shocks<00:02:37.050> are<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:38.670> they<00:02:38.790> call

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
suspension the shocks are what they call

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.210 
suspension the shocks are what they call
friction<00:02:39.180> shocks<00:02:39.750> which<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.620> bunch<00:02:41.010> of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
friction shocks which is a bunch of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.830 
friction shocks which is a bunch of
basically<00:02:41.730> almost<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> clutch<00:02:42.480> where<00:02:42.720> you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
basically almost like a clutch where you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
basically almost like a clutch where you
have<00:02:43.220> steel<00:02:44.220> plates<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:46.530> leather<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
have steel plates with leather and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
have steel plates with leather and
between<00:02:47.819> them<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.750> get<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.200> shock

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
between them and to get the shock

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
between them and to get the shock
dampening<00:02:50.269> adjusted<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.569> tighten<00:02:51.810> them

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
dampening adjusted you just tighten them

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.600 
dampening adjusted you just tighten them
down<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.920> rub<00:02:53.190> harder<00:02:53.459> together

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
down and so it's a rub harder together

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.309 
down and so it's a rub harder together
and<00:02:54.030> surprisingly<00:02:54.569> enough<00:02:54.720> they<00:02:54.989> work<00:02:55.170> pretty

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and surprisingly enough they work pretty

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.470 
and surprisingly enough they work pretty
good<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.920> they<00:02:56.519> were<00:02:56.580> used<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
good and they were used with that you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.720 
good and they were used with that you
