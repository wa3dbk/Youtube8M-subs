00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:13.619 
we're going to do the x-men crystal

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.590 
we're going to do the x-men crystal
except<00:00:14.619> I've<00:00:14.980> already<00:00:15.520> did<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.150> expanding

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
except I've already did the expanding

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.150 
except I've already did the expanding
crystal<00:00:16.930> I<00:00:17.110> already<00:00:17.460> recorded<00:00:18.460> this<00:00:18.699> and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
crystal I already recorded this and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840 
crystal I already recorded this and
somehow<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:22.150> file<00:00:22.630> failed<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.710> didn't<00:00:24.640> work

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
somehow the file failed and didn't work

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.230 
somehow the file failed and didn't work
it<00:00:25.210> didn't<00:00:26.020> play<00:00:26.230> back<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.580> what<00:00:27.850> I'm<00:00:28.180> just

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
it didn't play back so what I'm just

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.330 
it didn't play back so what I'm just
going<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.570> explain<00:00:28.960> what<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.590> did<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.160> what

i<00:00:33.910> will<00:00:34.059> open<00:00:34.149> other<00:00:34.629> crystals<00:00:35.260> I<00:00:35.469> was<00:00:36.010> not

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
i will open other crystals I was not

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.040 
i will open other crystals I was not
going<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.610> but<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.360> don't<00:00:37.450> want<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.900> guys

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.949 
10 and then I opened 10 and I got all
duplicates<00:01:08.679> except<00:01:09.429> three<00:01:09.789> star<00:01:10.030> Cyclops<00:01:10.600> I

00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:10.959 
duplicates except three star Cyclops I

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:16.199 
duplicates except three star Cyclops I
was<00:01:11.920> really<00:01:12.219> hoping<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.609> get<00:01:14.340> anything<00:01:15.340> really

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.340 
and i'm glad i got at least a three star
cyclops<00:01:20.950> but<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.209> know<00:01:22.299> i<00:01:22.329> was<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.929> little

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
cyclops but you know i was a little

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.230 
cyclops but you know i was a little
disappointed<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:24.069> time<00:01:24.340> i<00:01:24.639> was<00:01:25.029> really

disappointed this time i was really
hoping<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:26.560> four<00:01:26.829> star<00:01:27.100> hadn't<00:01:27.490> got<00:01:27.639> one<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:27.999> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
hoping for four star hadn't got one in a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.870 
hoping for four star hadn't got one in a
while<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:31.469> basically<00:01:32.469> you<00:01:33.310> know<00:01:33.429> in<00:01:33.700> this

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
while so basically you know in this

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940 
while so basically you know in this
crystals<00:01:34.359> forced<00:01:34.719> our<00:01:34.869> magic<00:01:35.289> four<00:01:35.740> star

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
crystals forced our magic four star

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.519 
crystals forced our magic four star
Colossus<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.700> forced<00:01:37.270> our<00:01:37.420> storm<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.139> then

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
Colossus and forced our storm and then

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.699 
Colossus and forced our storm and then
there's<00:01:39.389> three<00:01:40.389> star<00:01:40.659> Wolverine<00:01:41.170> three<00:01:41.499> star

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
there's three star Wolverine three star

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.609 
there's three star Wolverine three star
Cyclops<00:01:42.399> three<00:01:42.789> star<00:01:43.029> Colossus<00:01:44.020> three<00:01:44.259> starts

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
Cyclops three star Colossus three starts

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.480 
Cyclops three star Colossus three starts
storm<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.189> three<00:01:45.340> star<00:01:45.579> magic<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:47.249> in<00:01:48.249> this

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
storm and three star magic but in this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.919 
storm and three star magic but in this
one<00:01:48.689> unfortunately<00:01:50.069> only<00:01:51.069> get<00:01:51.969> the

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
one unfortunately only get the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.019 
one unfortunately only get the
three-star<00:01:53.409> Cyclops<00:01:53.889> so<00:01:54.279> then<00:01:54.609> I<00:01:54.639> had<00:01:54.880> another

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
three-star Cyclops so then I had another

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.589 
three-star Cyclops so then I had another
360<00:01:55.929> crystals<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.859> mean<00:01:57.310> how<00:01:57.399> units<00:01:57.849> left<00:01:58.209> over

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
360 crystals I mean how units left over

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.479 
360 crystals I mean how units left over
so<00:01:59.079> I<00:01:59.109> opened<00:01:59.469> two<00:01:59.619> more<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.009> then<00:02:00.099> got<00:02:00.310> two

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
so I opened two more and then got two

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.609 
so I opened two more and then got two
more<00:02:00.729> duplicates<00:02:00.909> but<00:02:01.810> because<00:02:02.169> of<00:02:02.200> all<00:02:02.409> this

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
more duplicates but because of all this

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.729 
more duplicates but because of all this
I<00:02:02.829> did<00:02:03.069> get<00:02:03.249> my<00:02:03.399> last<00:02:03.840> awakened<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.349> sort<00:02:05.619> that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
I did get my last awakened to sort that

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.100 
I did get my last awakened to sort that
i<00:02:05.799> did<00:02:06.009> not<00:02:06.159> have<00:02:06.520> currently<00:02:07.179> which<00:02:07.929> was

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
i did not have currently which was

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.440 
i did not have currently which was
Cyclops<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:08.770> now<00:02:08.890> he<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.580> got<00:02:09.970> two

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
Cyclops but now he is I got two

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.970 
Cyclops but now he is I got two
duplicates<00:02:10.959> of<00:02:11.140> him<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:11.560> doing<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.980> okay<00:02:12.850> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
duplicates of him and doing this okay so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.770 
duplicates of him and doing this okay so
okay<00:02:15.090> because

I failed miserably at recording and
opening<00:02:20.140> these<00:02:20.350> crystals<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.950> am<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.700> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
opening these crystals I am going to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.730 
opening these crystals I am going to
open<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.920> guys<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.880> got<00:02:25.300> 11<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.810> them<00:02:26.020> I'm

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
open these guys I got 11 of them I'm

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.040 
open these guys I got 11 of them I'm
gonna<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.310> hit<00:02:27.459> open<00:02:27.700> 10<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.420> normal<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
gonna just hit open 10 like normal and

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.699 
gonna just hit open 10 like normal and
hopefully<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.800> get<00:02:29.890> something<00:02:30.100> good<00:02:31.709> Captain

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
not doing well with the pullings crystal

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.699 
not doing well with the pullings crystal
pulls<00:03:18.459> done<00:03:18.880> doing<00:03:19.090> good<00:03:19.330> but<00:03:19.840> um<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.410> got<00:03:20.440> one
