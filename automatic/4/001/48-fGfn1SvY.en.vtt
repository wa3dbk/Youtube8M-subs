00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.710
 like the Santiago cake but for the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.970
 that you have no chance Hawaii 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.640

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.790

 milk chocolate as in this case 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.640
 the mild aromas or use the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.140
 purer chocolate and when you see that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.810

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.050
 sulfurized paper vegetable paper 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450
