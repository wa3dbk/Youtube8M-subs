00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
now I think the most interesting part

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
now I think the most interesting part
about<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.299> course<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.840> why<00:01:28.590> would

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
about this is of course that why would

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
about this is of course that why would
they<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.700> Marvel<00:01:30.210> doesn't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they take it down because Marvel doesn't

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
they take it down because Marvel doesn't
really<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.380> type<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.770> thing<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.130> mean<00:01:32.280> um
