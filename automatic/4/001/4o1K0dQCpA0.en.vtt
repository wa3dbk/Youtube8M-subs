00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.290
 I throw art, kick my feet and go back to my childhood.

 It was the first Tomato festival held in Valencia, Spain , 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.440

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.799
 Australia's Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge over looking the sky 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.840
 Compared to the view, it is exhilarating. 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:16.430
 The man who manages this ultra-lightweight plane is British Dave Sai. 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.509
 In April, Cyk alone took this ultra-light plane to York, England 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.649

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.510
 13 Mid-brazing So what about the inclusion of a shirt over a predicate 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.620
 Lease rovio item's quite a bit more 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.290
 I can not , but I'm doing it. 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.570

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.650
 Dave Cikes, who then completed the flight, drained the season seven light aircraft
