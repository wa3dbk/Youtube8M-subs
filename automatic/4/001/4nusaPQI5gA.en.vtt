which made them extinct irony is

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.220 
which made them extinct irony is
fantastic<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.950> basically<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.090> runs<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.570> PC<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
fantastic so basically it runs on PC and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.090 
fantastic so basically it runs on PC and
you<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.699> xbox<00:00:54.510> controllers<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.920> could

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you use to xbox controllers you could

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
you use to xbox controllers you could
probably<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.760> ps4<00:00:57.390> controllers<00:00:58.050> too<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
probably use ps4 controllers too but I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
probably use ps4 controllers too but I
didn't<00:00:59.579> test<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.780> who<00:01:01.739> knows<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.120> fly

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
didn't test it so who knows and you fly

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410 
didn't test it so who knows and you fly
