00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.500
 now I remind you it is not up to those 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.500
 the practical 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.169
 that effort but look at that result 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.419
 it's really worth it 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.489
 now then a good one looks good 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.629
 form and Latin of small currently 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.720
 but first maybe I will go to 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.909
 change 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.489
 here we are in the kitchen with our merits 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.489
 then to prepare the jam of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.949
 Figs without pectin are needed approximately 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.979
 two and a half kilos of peaks from which 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.059
 then we will get two kilos of pulp then 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:00.660
 of clean fig we still have a lemon 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.920
 where we will use the juice of half e 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.940
 then 700 grams of sugar or 350 g 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.470
 of sugar even of clean tychy for 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.810
 prepare fig jam 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 you should start the night before 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.020
 because everything must be put into macerate in the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.570
 sugar and lemon juice for at least 10 hours in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.170
 parts or so I am carried on and I have 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 cut the two and a half kilos of bitti e 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.509
 I got two kilos of pulp ho 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.929
 added all the sugar and juice 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.649
 lemon 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:39.300
 but you will tell me how to clean the 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.369
 figs then we always take ancient with 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.830
 the gloves because the pico latex 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.229
 it can be allergic so it can give 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.239
 a little discomfort in your hands 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.160
 remove the end with a knife 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.989
 preferably ceramic for non 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.170
 alter the active ingredients then 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:58.670
 we also remove the opposite end e 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.119
 then we keep it in half and every age then 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 we capture worse 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.640
 and so we proceed against pbt 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.220
 we put our pot with the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.239
 spikes on the fire is that first thing not 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 I told you why I gave it for 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.410
 discounted however the peaks I recommend e 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.900
 wash them well under fresh water and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.599
 then it dries bacteria dab them with a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.849
 soft cloth is also important 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.069
 cut them with the peel because it facilitates 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.440
 the thickening of the jam because 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.660
 as you have seen here we do not have 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 added ark pectin as instead 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.799
 we have seen for the preparation of 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.340
 previous jams 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.100
 here then I had also started boiling 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.290
 some jars for about 20 minutes in 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.180
 this way of sterile we will give to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.959
 perfection 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.069
 we return to our pot and here 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.500
 the foam is already beginning to form 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.940
 it must be removed as we know it can create 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.060
 a favorable environment for 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 potentially bacterial proliferation 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.450
 harmful to health 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.770
 has managed to remove the foam more 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.110
 easily 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.569
 I recommend you use the mixer 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.090
 then immersion at this time 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.130
 even before the jam begins 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.130
 thicken attention to the sketches mi 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.570
 I recommend you can blend on the town 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.020
 also leave these ends if you 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.020
 like it more 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.769
 we have our side on one side 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.629
 attention jam I repeat to you 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.400
 bubbles because I risked 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.269
 burn myself several times however see that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.609
 it has already thickened and boiled about 4 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.099
 5 minutes maximum and is almost ready 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.189
 so I would always leave it on fire 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.709
 moderate rather also low for 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.260
 prevent silin sugar from caramels 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.540
 at the bottom and then we go to remove the 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.459
 our in jars from the water of 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.980
 sterilization we removed for gods 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.230
 Our sterilized jars we have 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.319
 upside down so that it also dries 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.090
 the interior meanwhile we did 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.010
 also the saucer test so we have 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.139
 poured a drop of jam from 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.449
 figs in a dish as you see that not 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.840
 slips so it doesn't create don't create the 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:25.310
 liquid broth means that ready for 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.530
 investigate let's see how we're put here 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.250
 let's mix a little more see what it is 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.729
 of the name desa also wins to see a 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.729
 naked eye 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.610
 keep me based we always prepared 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.009
 the saucer usually with a sheet of 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.410
 moistened absorbent paper we can 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:52.009
 quickly put the jar on the top 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.630
 absorbent paper and now trying to 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.900
 dirty as little as possible looking 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.270
 we go to fill it said leaving 2 cm 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.130
 from the upper edge 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.630
 now we close immediately with the cork 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.010
 we always help with the sponge mi 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.139
 I recommend so avoid also of 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.169
 burn me and proceed to invade 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.789
 how lucky to find all those little ones 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.220
 wonderful and the supercar losi 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.330
 jam is truly extraordinary ed 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.699
 ence at the right point 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.580
 I like it spread on a nice slice 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.949
 of bread when it is still nice but warm 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.440
 I also recommend the combination of 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.960
 dtt jam with a bit of 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.680
 the contrasted seasoned cheese 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.680
 good to do
