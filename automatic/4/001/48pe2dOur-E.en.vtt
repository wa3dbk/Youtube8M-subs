bring up the system profiler in Snow

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
bring up the system profiler in Snow
Leopard<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.500> believe<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.099> line<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.789> about

Leopard I believe in line this is about

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.560 
Leopard I believe in line this is about

enter in that serial number hit return

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.549 
enter in that serial number hit return
and<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> find<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.539> mac<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> get

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and it's going to find your mac and get

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.090 
and it's going to find your mac and get
the<00:01:04.680> exact<00:01:05.100> model<00:01:05.760> number<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> i<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.770> see

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the exact model number so that i can see

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
the exact model number so that i can see
this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.549> early<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.540> thousand<00:01:09.960> eight<00:01:10.020> mac<00:01:10.500> pro

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this is early two thousand eight mac pro

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
this is early two thousand eight mac pro
and<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.640> click<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.420> tech<00:01:12.869> specs

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and i can click on it to get tech specs

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
and i can click on it to get tech specs
so<00:01:14.220> once<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.670> i<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.240> sorts

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
so once i do that i get all sorts

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
so once i do that i get all sorts
information<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.159> instance<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
information here for instance i get the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980 
information here for instance i get the
original<00:01:18.530> standard<00:01:20.780> specifications<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
original standard specifications and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
original standard specifications and
also<00:01:22.229> built<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> order<00:01:22.619> options<00:01:23.220> what's<00:01:23.790> very

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
also built to order options what's very

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.190 
also built to order options what's very
useful<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> built<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> order

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
useful here is the built to order

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
useful here is the built to order
options<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.890> memory<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.970> what

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
options for memory so you can see what

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
options for memory so you can see what
memory<00:01:27.600> supported<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.380> instance<00:01:28.439> i<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
memory supported so for instance i can

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
memory supported so for instance i can
see<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.180> standard<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.409> gigs

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
see that the standard was just two gigs

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
see that the standard was just two gigs
of<00:01:31.860> memory<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.659> fact<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
of memory but you can in fact go up to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
of memory but you can in fact go up to
32<00:01:34.799> gigs<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:36.350> 84<00:01:37.350> gig<00:01:37.619> sticks<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.090> of

32 gigs with 84 gig sticks now one of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.280 
32 gigs with 84 gig sticks now one of
the<00:01:39.240> most<00:01:39.360> important<00:01:39.840> bits<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> information

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the most important bits of information

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
the most important bits of information
is<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> top<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.420> see
