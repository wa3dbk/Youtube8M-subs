00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
is type of registry I guess at that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.670 
is type of registry I guess at that
point<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.729> was<00:01:39.790> just<00:01:39.850> strictly<00:01:40.450> for<00:01:40.960> Remy<00:01:41.409> line

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
point it was just strictly for Remy line

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.469 
point it was just strictly for Remy line
people<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.640> they<00:01:42.729> could<00:01:42.850> have<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:43.030> home<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.240> go

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
the rkc well rkc actually started to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.819 
the rkc well rkc actually started to
evolve<00:01:57.340> after<00:01:57.880> RLC<00:01:58.840> because<00:01:59.289> there's<00:01:59.409> only<00:01:59.530> so

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
evolve after RLC because there's only so

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.529 
evolve after RLC because there's only so
much<00:02:00.070> growth<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.640> could<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:00.939> within<00:02:01.180> a

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
much growth you could do within a

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.260 
much growth you could do within a
bloodline<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:04.350> rkc<00:02:05.350> became<00:02:06.100> my<00:02:06.310> passion<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
bloodline but rkc became my passion the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.900 
bloodline but rkc became my passion the
Day<00:02:07.420> Remy<00:02:07.689> died<00:02:07.990> which<00:02:08.920> kind<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.369> makes<00:02:09.580> a
