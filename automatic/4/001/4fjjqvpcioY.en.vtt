00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.379
 episode of the trident again let's 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.200
 try to get the rakitin naranjita 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:19.130
 As you know in the previous episode, 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.720
 we managed to win the game not even 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.630
 sending me all embittered life more 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 marked the existence of stopped everything 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 so true that in the first part 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 I was very bad I gave him a goal 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 practically to the rival and that therefore it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.280
 ends up paying and in this tenth episode 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 let's try again to see if 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.090
 we're lucky guys remember that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 there are very few episodes left 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 there are two posts left to improve and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.390
 we will finish this seville so nothing 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's go with today's game to see if 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.340
 we are lucky let's see the rival with 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.260
 the one that we have to face today and good 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.950
 it was about time that we will play a rival 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 so to speak, flojillo peter chef 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.580
 smolin terrier 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.670
 walker walcott fabregas van persie harry 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.950
 caine hero or game care these 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.650
 teams may be the ones that have more problems 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.259
 give us but well I think that today we have 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.119
 a great opportunity to make history and 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.119
 get a rakitic hand theme 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.790
 come from the ball n party 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 as an animal 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.140
 like neymar and he lost it 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 Messi who has recovered Messi pulled 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.260
 very easy quality for peter chef 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.240
 van persie this for özil 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.899

 let's correct what they can do 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.110
 many years takes out long opens cane 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.940
 Havana or if he 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.250
 pique defenses 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.950
 for fabregas 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.530
 fabregas fabregas that goes deep 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.690
 fabregas van persie 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.520
 I do not know what Claudio Bravo has done 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.490
 they turn around they have heard by the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.130
 ball and van persie mark us first not 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.290
 you could start worse it stays 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.569
 the brave claudio turns around but 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.569
 guys 1 to 0 we started losing 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.030
 for me if a ball inside a month and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.709
 month and inside the area I split peter 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.299
 well we have reacted well we have 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.569
 related well to the sofas to mark 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.489
 goal 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.030
 where xavi for messi months ago for 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.310
 animate the same as the take on the line 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.579
 when it was going to be the draw without the ball 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.549
 to get in, do not be with neymar neymar 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.739
 Another parade of Peter you'll see you're 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.900
 in the previous episode he was sending and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.840
 this is going to be the 7 that we're going to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.730
 give the day the next 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.410
 dani alves for luís suárez suárez outside 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.470
 we went away deflected the shot of Luis 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.390
 Suarez and the first part ends 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.140
 guys we go with 0 to 1 in the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.300
 marker 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.340
 the truth that we are having occasions 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.890
 but be careful that every time you arrive 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.890
 our rival creates a lot of danger 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.900
 and for harry caine care harry caine 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.310
 goal 0 to 2 worse could not be put 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.650
 we have to go up and over we have 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.960
 to score a goal with the three of 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.130
 above 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.130
 take the corner to break 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.910
 although the accounts to paste mother of 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.480
 beautiful love 0 to 3 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.800
 with more luck you can not this I do not know 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.200
 how has that goal gotten 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:10.010
 and nothing guys is what there is this is life 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:13.519
 How do I read Leo Messi's progress? 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.739
 we go man with all the side and with everything 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.560
 that go fuck connection have 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.410
 our rival goal of men's interest 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.780
 one we cut a goal with one 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.500
 of our client at least come 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.880
 that I think you can see that our 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.010
 rival is going to stay with a player 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.410
 least we have to take advantage of these 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.270
 guys I think he's done a terry he has 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.790
 there is an entry to Luis Suarez 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.340
 second yellow red card 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.860
 Now is a good time to turn it around 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.669
 of the marker 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.230
 Long ball for Suarez Let's go Luis 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.560
 on 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.730
 get ready the subienda derecha suárez gol 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.730
 from luis suárez 2 to 3 12 minutes left 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.000
 you have to score two goals and one goal with 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.289
 neymar and we would have rickets not 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.490
 themes 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:13.080
 walcott load down 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.330
 as a framework for where claudio bravo and de 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.699
 Careful ball say it to hit hostile 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.539
 at the hands of claudio bravo mena saca 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.479
 Quick command for Messi Messi open the 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.840
 frontal for mascherano east with xavi 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:31.610
 xabi with jordi alba say is there only 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.610
 go have sea 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.610
 golden 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.699
 and with the connection shit of our 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.550
 Rival 3 to 3 we have been even more difficult 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.990
 we're at minute 86 and we have to 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.039
 mark a bowl with anyone to win at 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.770
 rakitic hands over for the next 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.240
 episode we're going to cheer you can not 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.389
 fuck does not fuck you or fuck 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.380
 if they are still there, the band goes into 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:04.770
 the waiting area to the criminal type and what 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.099
 he has not whistled 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.930
 we have it we just have to dial 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.509
 the penalty well what gives me is the 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.729
 that has the party that is possible that 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.069
 it has it up outside now it will say the 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.460
 penalty with leo messi I think he has the 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:23.490
 Team confidence come and say 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.500
 Please, please, please, if he does not 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.720
 Kills me kills me next 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.110
 good good is not worth no more to make it 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.050
 like tennessee just to see if we have 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.720
 got guys comeback impossible 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.570
 I knew that this expulsion is going to 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.220
 To do a lot of damage we have scored a goal 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:48.760
 with the three above and epic comeback 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.580
 43 on the scoreboard and the game is over 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.950
 we 've got it guys I think that 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.320
 this episode if this one deserves to burst 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.930
 the button of light guys we have done what 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.870
 more difficult a game that we lost 3 to 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.300
 0 and the expulsion of John Terry has 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.160
 come fatal to fathal josh we have been 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.220
 turn it around dialing with the three of 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.070
 therefore we will have up to ranking 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.830
 hand issue in the next episode and 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.910
 good guys very much suffered this victory 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.160
 as you see more what 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.960
 the rival what has cost me the most is the 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.220
 connection had a connection a connection 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.620
 Very bad 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.960
 our rival and have slowed down the 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.340
 players many times I did not see you arrived 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.200
 late for that 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.730
 they have expelled 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.470
 from here if you are watching this video 

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.170
 buy yourself a connection because mine is 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.560
 bad but yours is horrible and good 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.440
 we have changes rating very good player 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.290
 but this pole has to be sublime the 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.120
 team is in need of a challenge that only 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.790
 it poses us to change the position of xavi 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.790
 hernandez by the line is still in 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.340
 the next episode in we will fight for the 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:59.040
 remember if we win the game only 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.800
 we'd better search and if we win and 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.420
 we also mark with the three above 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.180
 we would complete the team the best team 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.160
 of Barcelona possible therefore 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.680
 guys, maybe this is the 

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.630
 penultimate episode so nothing guys 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.090
 I hope you leave many likes for that 

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.860
 epic comeback all your cousin if not 

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.820
