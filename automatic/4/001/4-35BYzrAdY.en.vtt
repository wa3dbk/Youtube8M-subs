00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
my favorite liquid eyeliner is

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.080 
my favorite liquid eyeliner is
like<00:03:33.290> stiletto<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.100> recently<00:03:34.520> they<00:03:34.760> change

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
like stiletto but recently they change

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.210 
like stiletto but recently they change
the<00:03:35.300> formula<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.740> black<00:03:36.980> as

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the formula and now it's not as black as

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.040 
the formula and now it's not as black as
it<00:03:37.370> used<00:03:37.520> to<00:03:37.670> be<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.090> it's<00:03:38.210> also<00:03:38.390> really<00:03:38.720> bunny

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
it used to be and it's also really bunny

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.990 
it used to be and it's also really bunny
so<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.440> actually<00:03:39.800> don't<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.400> anymore<00:03:40.610> and
