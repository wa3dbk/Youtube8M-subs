path<00:00:04.560> 1<00:00:05.480> so<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.660> path<00:00:06.870> got<00:00:07.170> nerfed<00:00:07.350> quite<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
path 1 so this path got nerfed quite a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.480 
path 1 so this path got nerfed quite a
bit<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.309> January<00:00:08.880> 28th<00:00:09.330> patch<00:00:09.920> before<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
bit in the January 28th patch before the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.740 
bit in the January 28th patch before the
first<00:00:11.940> fight

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
first fight

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.839 
first fight
was<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> DPS<00:00:14.009> checker<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.519> did<00:00:14.670> have

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
was kind of a DPS checker you did have

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.810 
was kind of a DPS checker you did have
to<00:00:14.969> manage<00:00:15.360> multiple<00:00:15.660> mobs<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.289> kept<00:00:16.560> coming

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
to manage multiple mobs that kept coming

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
to manage multiple mobs that kept coming
now<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:18.060> made<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.510> pretty<00:00:18.810> much<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
now they made it pretty much just like a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.859 
now they made it pretty much just like a
normal<00:00:19.820> champion<00:00:20.820> golden<00:00:21.180> fight<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.720> not

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
normal champion golden fight so it's not

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
normal champion golden fight so it's not
too<00:00:22.080> difficult<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.920> pretty<00:00:23.730> much<00:00:23.820> any<00:00:24.000> group

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
too difficult and pretty much any group

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.679 
too difficult and pretty much any group
can<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:25.430> this<00:00:26.430> path<00:00:26.699> did<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.390> quite<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
can do it now this path did get quite a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
can do it now this path did get quite a
bit<00:00:27.900> shorter<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.529> well<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.550> probably

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
bit shorter as well it's now probably

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
bit shorter as well it's now probably
about<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> length<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.869> cof<00:00:31.320> path<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.980> can

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
about the length of cof path one you can

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.150 
about the length of cof path one you can
do<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.570> 7<00:00:34.079> minutes<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> speed

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
do it in about 7 minutes with a speed

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
do it in about 7 minutes with a speed

punches nothing too crazy from here the
waves<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> inquests<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.820> resume<00:01:45.420> spawning

killing<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.200> ignoring<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> mobs

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.310 

eventually<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> mobs<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.659> leash<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
eventually the mobs will leash so it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
eventually the mobs will leash so it's
not<00:02:01.439> too<00:02:01.619> big<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> deal<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.280> since<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.759> only<00:02:02.969> need

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
not too big a deal and since I only need

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
not too big a deal and since I only need
wall<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.750> reflection<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.310> two

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
wall of reflection now I do have two

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.609 
wall of reflection now I do have two
shouts<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.180> remove<00:02:06.479> conditions<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
shouts to remove conditions like the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.510 
shouts to remove conditions like the
chillin<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:10.520> reflection

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
chillin right there and the reflection

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.920 
chillin right there and the reflection
skills<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.970> still<00:02:12.209> good<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.690> put<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
skills are still good you can put it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.880 
skills are still good you can put it
like<00:02:13.050> right<00:02:13.260> behind<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
like right behind you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.520 
like right behind you
when<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.160> fighting<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.610> turret<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.530> it'll

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
when you're fighting a turret and it'll

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.020 
when you're fighting a turret and it'll
block<00:02:16.740> most<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> damage<00:02:17.610> from<00:02:17.640> the

block most of the damage from the
inquest<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.690> well<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> after<00:02:24.810> these<00:02:25.080> two

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
inquest as well so after these two

inquest as well so after these two
barrier<00:02:25.920> turrets<00:02:26.340> were<00:02:26.459> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.940> come<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
barrier turrets were going to come to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390 
barrier turrets were going to come to
the<00:02:27.510> second<00:02:27.870> boss<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.350> path<00:02:28.620> his<00:02:28.980> name<00:02:29.190> is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
attacks the main thing you want to watch

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.260 
attacks the main thing you want to watch
out<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.580> want<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> stand<00:02:36.120> next

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
out for is you don't want to stand next

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.630 
out for is you don't want to stand next
to<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.870> Ledge<00:02:37.320> or<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.920> position<00:02:38.220> where<00:02:38.550> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
to a Ledge or in a position where you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.190 
to a Ledge or in a position where you
can<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.940> knocked<00:02:39.240> off<00:02:39.450> into<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> lava

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can get knocked off into the lava

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.710 
can get knocked off into the lava
because<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.459> his<00:02:41.670> four<00:02:41.940> attacks<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.690> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
because one of his four attacks is a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
because one of his four attacks is a
knock<00:02:43.110> back<00:02:43.380> move<00:02:43.620> probably<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.850> same

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
knock back move probably the same

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.030 
knock back move probably the same
distance<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:46.200> any<00:02:46.380> knock<00:02:46.590> back<00:02:46.800> move

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
distance as you know any knock back move

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.850 
distance as you know any knock back move
like<00:02:47.310> Mesmer<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> great<00:02:48.000> sword<00:02:48.270> for<00:02:48.450> instance

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
like Mesmer a great sword for instance

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.710 
like Mesmer a great sword for instance
so<00:02:49.860> you'll<00:02:50.010> see<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.790> stand<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.239> an<00:02:51.390> area

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
so you'll see I will stand in an area

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.330 
so you'll see I will stand in an area
where<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.200> get<00:02:52.470> knocked<00:02:52.680> back<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.190> would

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
where if I do get knocked back I would

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.360 
where if I do get knocked back I would
fall<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.790> solid<00:02:54.269> ground<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.070> second<00:02:56.070> attack

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
fall on solid ground the second attack

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
fall on solid ground the second attack
is<00:02:56.400> he's<00:02:56.850> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> freeze<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.600> person<00:02:58.050> for

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
is he's going to freeze one person for

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.290 
is he's going to freeze one person for
about<00:02:58.440> seven<00:02:58.800> seconds<00:02:59.310> there's<00:02:59.940> not<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.269> you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
about seven seconds there's not much you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.620 
about seven seconds there's not much you
can<00:03:00.570> do<00:03:00.720> really<00:03:01.489> but<00:03:02.489> since<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.180> only<00:03:03.390> one

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
can do really but since it is only one

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
can do really but since it is only one
person<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.080> still<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.410> four<00:03:04.650> people<00:03:05.010> who

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
person you still have four people who

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.150 
person you still have four people who
can<00:03:05.459> do<00:03:06.060> DPS<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> try<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.470> keep<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.769> person

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
can do DPS and try and keep that person

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.690 
can do DPS and try and keep that person
up<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.300> third<00:03:09.540> attack<00:03:10.080> he<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.800> going<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.430> is

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
up the third attack he is going to do is

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.340 
up the third attack he is going to do is
he's<00:03:11.910> going<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> plant<00:03:12.300> little<00:03:12.720> red<00:03:12.870> circles

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
he's going to plant little red circles

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.890 
he's going to plant little red circles
they<00:03:13.650> are<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.040> cause<00:03:14.269> confusion<00:03:15.269> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
they are going to cause confusion and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
they are going to cause confusion and
vulnerability<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.370> either<00:03:17.640> don't

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
vulnerability on you just either don't

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.720 
vulnerability on you just either don't
stand<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.570> them<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.989> they<00:03:19.680> actually<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.519> that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
stand in them or they actually not that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.300 
stand in them or they actually not that
big<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> deal<00:03:21.000> if<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.329> have<00:03:21.360> condition<00:03:21.840> removal

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
big a deal if you have condition removal

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.830 
big a deal if you have condition removal
so<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.760> stand<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.180> them<00:03:24.299> as<00:03:24.450> long<00:03:24.570> as<00:03:24.630> you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
so you can stand in them as long as you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.380 
so you can stand in them as long as you
have<00:03:24.959> condition<00:03:25.350> removal<00:03:25.709> as<00:03:25.890> well<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.430> then

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
have condition removal as well and then

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.900 
have condition removal as well and then
the<00:03:27.660> fourth<00:03:27.989> attack<00:03:28.170> he<00:03:28.530> does<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:29.010> he<00:03:29.430> spawns

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the fourth attack he does is he spawns

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.970 
the fourth attack he does is he spawns
these<00:03:30.360> things<00:03:30.630> called<00:03:30.900> singularities<00:03:31.739> they

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
these things called singularities they

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030 
these things called singularities they
look<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.400> lightning<00:03:33.269> elementals<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.860> can

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
look like lightning elementals you can

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.100 
look like lightning elementals you can
just<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:35.459> stand<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:35.970> them<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.360> damage<00:03:36.660> or

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
just not stand in them they do damage or

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.710 
just not stand in them they do damage or
you<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.620> damage<00:03:37.980> them<00:03:38.190> down<00:03:38.400> with

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you can just damage them down with

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.590 
you can just damage them down with
natural<00:03:39.720> cleave<00:03:39.959> while<00:03:40.200> your<00:03:40.350> DPS<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:40.950> him<00:03:41.600> so

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
natural cleave while your DPS in him so

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.670 
natural cleave while your DPS in him so
after<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.019> boss<00:03:43.200> we're<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.560> run
