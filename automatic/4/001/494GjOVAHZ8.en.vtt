00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
walks everywhere she walks inside

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.029 
walks everywhere she walks inside
outside<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:27.930> know<00:05:28.050> she<00:05:28.139> doesn't<00:05:28.469> really<00:05:28.710> trip

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
outside you know she doesn't really trip

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.579 
outside you know she doesn't really trip
anymore<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.779> in<00:05:30.779> the<00:05:30.930> beginning<00:05:31.110> when<00:05:31.469> she

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
anymore and in the beginning when she

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:32.959 
anymore and in the beginning when she
first<00:05:31.740> heard<00:05:31.889> of<00:05:32.009> walking<00:05:32.580> she<00:05:32.759> would<00:05:32.879> get

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
first heard of walking she would get

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.240 
first heard of walking she would get
bruises<00:05:33.449> like<00:05:33.599> all<00:05:33.810> over<00:05:34.050> her<00:05:34.169> face<00:05:34.409> and<00:05:34.650> her

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
bruises like all over her face and her

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.999 
bruises like all over her face and her
body<00:05:35.490> she<00:05:35.819> was<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.930> was<00:05:37.139> so<00:05:37.409> bad<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.949> she

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
body she was just it was so bad and she

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.240 
body she was just it was so bad and she
would<00:05:38.250> get<00:05:38.400> like<00:05:38.639> a<00:05:38.819> black<00:05:39.300> eye<00:05:39.509> sometimes

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
would get like a black eye sometimes

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.559 
would get like a black eye sometimes
because<00:05:41.250> I<00:05:41.460> mean<00:05:41.879> babies<00:05:42.240> when<00:05:42.449> they're

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
because I mean babies when they're

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.689 
because I mean babies when they're
learning<00:05:42.719> to<00:05:42.990> walk<00:05:43.169> it's<00:05:44.099> just

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
learning to walk it's just

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.019 
learning to walk it's just
danger<00:05:45.599> zone<00:05:45.629> like<00:05:46.080> it<00:05:46.229> is<00:05:46.379> it's<00:05:46.770> scary<00:05:47.310> but

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
danger zone like it is it's scary but

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.200 
danger zone like it is it's scary but
now<00:05:48.330> thankfully<00:05:49.139> she<00:05:49.469> doesn't<00:05:49.860> fall<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.729> over

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
now thankfully she doesn't fall it over

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.050 
now thankfully she doesn't fall it over
anymore<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.960> she<00:05:52.379> hasn't<00:05:52.589> gotten<00:05:53.009> bruised<00:05:53.639> in

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
anymore and she hasn't gotten bruised in

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.899 
anymore and she hasn't gotten bruised in
a<00:05:54.389> while<00:05:54.629> so<00:05:55.379> I'm<00:05:55.710> hoping<00:05:56.129> like<00:05:56.189> touchwood

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
a while so I'm hoping like touchwood

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.610 
a while so I'm hoping like touchwood
that<00:05:57.089> that<00:05:57.210> stays<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:57.659> same<00:05:57.689> her<00:05:58.289> vocabulary

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
that that stays the same her vocabulary

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.159 
that that stays the same her vocabulary
grows<00:05:59.279> every<00:06:00.210> day<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:00.569> I<00:06:00.629> think<00:06:00.659> that's<00:06:00.960> the

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
grows every day and I think that's the

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.829 
grows every day and I think that's the
most<00:06:01.319> exciting<00:06:01.560> part<00:06:02.189> about<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.879> stage<00:06:03.479> is

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:03.839 
most exciting part about this stage is

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.679 
most exciting part about this stage is
how<00:06:04.229> much<00:06:04.500> she's<00:06:04.770> talking<00:06:05.250> now<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.669> am<00:06:06.479> NOT

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
how much she's talking now I am NOT

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:07.969 
how much she's talking now I am NOT
going<00:06:06.779> to<00:06:06.839> give<00:06:06.990> a<00:06:07.020> big<00:06:07.169> list<00:06:07.439> of<00:06:07.620> everything

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
going to give a big list of everything

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.459 
going to give a big list of everything
that<00:06:08.159> she<00:06:08.430> could<00:06:08.550> say<00:06:08.849> but<00:06:09.110> because<00:06:10.110> I<00:06:10.139> don't

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
that she could say but because I don't

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.829 
that she could say but because I don't
even<00:06:10.560> remember<00:06:10.800> but<00:06:11.759> she'll<00:06:12.300> just<00:06:12.449> come<00:06:12.659> out

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
even remember but she'll just come out

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.659 
even remember but she'll just come out
with<00:06:13.050> things<00:06:13.229> sometimes<00:06:13.830> she<00:06:14.310> loves<00:06:14.520> her

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
with things sometimes she loves her

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.679 
with things sometimes she loves her
books<00:06:14.939> I<00:06:15.389> read<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.319> her<00:06:16.439> every<00:06:16.650> single<00:06:16.979> day<00:06:17.370> and

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:17.689 
books I read to her every single day and

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.839 
books I read to her every single day and
she<00:06:18.689> loves<00:06:18.930> to<00:06:19.110> point<00:06:19.379> out<00:06:19.650> characters<00:06:20.490> and

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
she loves to point out characters and

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.189 
she loves to point out characters and
point<00:06:21.089> out<00:06:21.270> different<00:06:21.599> and<00:06:21.719> say<00:06:21.900> different

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
point out different and say different

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.499 
point out different and say different
words<00:06:22.529> and<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.889> think<00:06:23.189> that's<00:06:23.639> kind<00:06:23.969> of<00:06:24.120> helped

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
words and I think that's kind of helped

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.839 
words and I think that's kind of helped
a<00:06:24.599> lot<00:06:24.719> to<00:06:25.050> build<00:06:25.229> hope<00:06:25.529> her<00:06:25.800> vocabulary<00:06:26.250> she's

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849
