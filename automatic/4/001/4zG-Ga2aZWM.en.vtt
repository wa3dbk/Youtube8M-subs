00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.059
 a ship on the high seas has the space 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 in and around rack of hundreds of mailing can 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 it will only be then that we will be the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.660
 people who have it right and safe 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 should be home therefore the ships 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.180
 above sixteen hundred tons 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 radioman aboard have been 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.449
 it doesn't happen every day 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 there are enough reasons and conceivable 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 fast communication with others 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 ships or with radio coastal stations and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.610
 cause of life or death 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 for so do not create 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 have communication options than is possible 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 the people were on in case of emergency 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.489
 to fate about being labeled next to it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.570
 ship of the highest possible safety 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.700
 to assure 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 is the radio option your task 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 Listening waited to relieve 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.660
 time zone radio news and weather forecast and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 to receive and all possible 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 record or zoom out messages 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.289
 who become shipping company the cat one and the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.699
 were on the day of interest 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.280
 these messages are picked up by 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 scheveningen radio and delivered to the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 addressee 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.260
 no radio 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.930
 the overijssel that's good you received 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.760
 well and we for Amsterdam 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.800
 despite modern developments 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.510
 living mass characters an indispensable 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.090
 means for radio communication 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.110
 elly Morse gets the aspirant 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.760
 radio officer 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.530
 literally and figuratively in the 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.930
 fingers during his two year old 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.650
 training on the radio holland or 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 nautical schools 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.220
 in addition to morphs will be the future 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.040
 radio or see also venus and mars have 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
 in the field of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.399
 marine electronics a spacious 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.580
 theoretical and practical knowledge of 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.380
 transmitters receivers and greenlo the radio 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 on any equipment and radars 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 necessary 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.230
 in short the entire arsenal and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.510
 electronic equipment on board 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.450
 by him it is not about equipment 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.070
 which it constitutes for the uninitiated 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.530
 because the radio or soul will have to be the man 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.600
 are all that electronic ingenuity and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.880
 company has to keep and so is 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.370
 are training oriented 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.810
 He is a professional you everywhere and prayed too 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.650
 world and creases might find 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.230
 and that certainly not be alone at sea 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.209
 used to have eyes 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.209
 amplifier base that are bad yes 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.360
 put transmitting but with art antenna 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.080
 well on her 2 and then tune 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.080
 no no the reason 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.980
 no matter how family setting yes it is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.879
 well start calling 5 year old 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.879
 son and what not 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:21.799
 westduinweg on 8622 on hvc 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.799
 this siemens nbc 348 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.360
 and then we find the toilet a3 transmitter 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 of course the future 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.040
 radio officer 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.680
 also familiarized in the determine and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.140
 quick handling of such equipment to 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.519
 possible emergency situations as well as possible 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.769
 to cope 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.959
 can be of understanding and competence 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.129
 a lot or maybe at some point 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.129
 everything depends 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.519
 here is a small radio telegraphy 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.349
 transceiver operating in an emergency 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.629
 can be put overboard 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.099
 fished out of the water and in short 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.099
 put into operation for possible time 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.389
 this ship is also a radio officer there 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.530
 bad and subjects that safety 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.880
 increases 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.550
 who creates the communication of it 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.070
 well cared for but slightly the question arises 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.169
 side that this appeal be trained 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.480
 qualify thereby young ones 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.370
 have gone through an hour or hbs and still 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.690
 did not reach the age of 20 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.250
 to have 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.960
 It is important to know that during 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.620
 the training and practice of it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.300
 profession 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.460
 we are put to the military 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.930
 conscription 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.240
 Are you interested in this profession? 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.639
 that can also serve as a start-up 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.560
 for a career at the ball then you can 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.700
 receive further information via the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.910
