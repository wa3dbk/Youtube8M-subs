00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.300
You and Full Tilt parted ways last year. What does and will this mean to your poker career?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.900
It means that me and Pinocchio are free as a bird. We have no ties.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:37.400
No, I've had a long relationship with Full Tilt. A good relationship, which it still is. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.540
We decided to part ways in September when my contract ended. That's often where you part ways. 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:01:00.840
In one way or the other Full Tilt is connected to PokerStars and PokerStars is the big, big, big brother.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.520
Full Tilt felt they wanted to take a different path and focus 100% on fighting their way back up next to PokerStars.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:23.920
They felt they didn't have the budget to have people like me or Isildur in their stable.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.820
His ended contract a little later than mine.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.320
Perhaps it was a good time for me to break up with Full Tilt.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.720
It's no secret that I had lost, lost and lost a little more in a longer period of time.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.000
Maybe it was also a reasonable time for me to get some breathing space.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:09.260
As people know I haven't been playing much the last four or five months. I had a week between Christmas and New Years Eve with a good day, a bad day, a really good day and a really bad day.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.560
It ended up in small loss. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.180
That wasn't an especially well done comeback. I don't think I played well. There were many factors I didn't have control of.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:34.140
I wanted to give it a shot after a long break, but I didn't feel I was ready to enter the lion's cage. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:45.060
That's how it can feel when you play Pot Limit Omaha with some of the world's best. You probably know the nick names better than I do.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:55.000
I know that Kyllonen and the likes know how that's supposed to be played. So that wasn't the right timing on my part.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:05.800
It's been some weeks since and I don't feel in a hurry to get back playing online or go play an EPT.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:21.160
I have WSOP on my schedule. I have EPT in Monaco on my schedule. I don't even know what will happen until then.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.980
Recently I've been spending some time in Denmark with friends and family. I'm going travelling the next couple of weeks.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.940
Among other things there's a bridge tournament on Iceland, a squash tournament in New York. Squash is another passion of mine.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:49.800
So right now I don't have any poker plans. I might have a plan to play some online in a smaller sense.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:03.700
That could be 2/4, 5/10 Pot Limit Omaha to get in shape so you don't get too rusty.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.920
If that happens tomorrow or in four weeks... It definitely won't happen tomorrow as I'm busy with this bridge tournament in Copenhagen the next four days.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.940
I actually don't know, I can't give a good answer to that.
