00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
length it goes quite a good bit it was

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.960 
length it goes quite a good bit it was
originally<00:00:32.960> built<00:00:33.079> by<00:00:33.200> cold<00:00:33.590> shift<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.220> it's

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
originally built by cold shift and it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.660 
originally built by cold shift and it's
very<00:00:35.240> long<00:00:35.540> takes<00:00:36.170> a<00:00:36.500> little<00:00:36.890> bit<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.100> time<00:00:37.370> to

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
very long takes a little bit of time to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.020 
very long takes a little bit of time to
go<00:00:37.910> to<00:00:37.970> either<00:00:38.210> side<00:00:38.540> looks<00:00:39.290> very<00:00:39.590> fancy<00:00:40.130> well

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
go to either side looks very fancy well

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.990 
go to either side looks very fancy well
you'll<00:00:41.240> see<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.540> about<00:00:41.780> three<00:00:42.560> quarters

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
you'll see that about three quarters

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.060 
you'll see that about three quarters
unless<00:00:44.000> they<00:00:44.240> did<00:00:44.390> some<00:00:44.570> work<00:00:44.720> on<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.110> since<00:00:45.860> I

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070
