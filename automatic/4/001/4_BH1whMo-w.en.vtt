 hello friends I hope you go 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.590
 well 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.720
 I'll meet you today for you 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.910
 present a spring makeup 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 also an outfit so the makeup 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.600
 it's this one I was trying to do 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.370
 something colorful but that remained 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.590
 still a little soft if you can 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.570
 say and who at the same time was not doing 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.129
 too much cabbage compared to my hair that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.820

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.330
 know are red 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.540

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.879

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.250
 way that I pink lipstick etc 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.719

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.629
