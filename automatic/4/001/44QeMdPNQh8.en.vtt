expertise in electric bikes here in

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
expertise in electric bikes here in
North<00:00:52.260> America<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:53.010> ebike<00:00:53.850> Drive<00:00:54.120> systems<00:00:54.600> we

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
North America on ebike Drive systems we

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
North America on ebike Drive systems we
can<00:00:54.960> choose<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.530> either<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.250> center<00:00:57.090> motor

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
can choose from either a center motor

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.349 
can choose from either a center motor
like<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.899> use<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> Yuba<00:00:59.309> spicy<00:00:59.609> curry<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like we use on the Yuba spicy curry or a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.740 
like we use on the Yuba spicy curry or a
hub<00:01:01.079> motor<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.399> chose<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.090> center<00:01:03.510> drive

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
hub motor and we chose a center drive

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
hub motor and we chose a center drive
motor<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> relatively<00:01:05.820> low

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
motor we can use a relatively low

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.300 
motor we can use a relatively low
wattage<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.960> efficient<00:01:07.470> motor<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.159> get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
wattage and efficient motor so you get

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
wattage and efficient motor so you get
great<00:01:08.610> range<00:01:09.320> out<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> battery<00:01:10.979> capacity

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
great range out of the battery capacity

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
great range out of the battery capacity
that<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.420> also<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> benefit<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that you have and also the benefit of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
that you have and also the benefit of
tremendous<00:01:14.460> torque<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.509> climb<00:01:15.950> very

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
tremendous torque so you can climb very

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.600 
tremendous torque so you can climb very
steep<00:01:17.310> hills<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> carry<00:01:18.150> significant<00:01:19.020> loads

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
steep hills and carry significant loads

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
steep hills and carry significant loads
very<00:01:20.610> efficiently<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> bike<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.619> weight

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
very efficiently on the bike the weight

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
very efficiently on the bike the weight
is<00:01:23.100> low<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.490> centered<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> handling

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
is low in centered so the handling

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
is low in centered so the handling
characteristics<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.650> fantastic<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.880> really

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
characteristics are fantastic we really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
characteristics are fantastic we really
think<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> perfect<00:01:28.200> combination

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
think that it's the perfect combination

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.640 
think that it's the perfect combination
between<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.909> Yuba<00:01:30.390> long<00:01:30.810> tail<00:01:31.049> cargo<00:01:31.470> bike

written a lot of electric cargo bikes
and<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> exceptional

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and I think that one of the exceptional

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.520 
and I think that one of the exceptional
things<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> spicy<00:01:57.930> curry<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> its

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
things about the spicy curry is its

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.580 
things about the spicy curry is its
lightness<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> its<00:01:59.880> nimbleness<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.500> think

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
lightness and its nimbleness so I think

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.749 
lightness and its nimbleness so I think
it's<00:02:01.799> gonna<00:02:01.920> fit<00:02:02.100> him<00:02:02.219> real<00:02:02.369> nicely

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it's gonna fit him real nicely

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.539 
it's gonna fit him real nicely
the<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.509> thing<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.020> sort<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> ride<00:02:05.159> feel

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the other thing is sort of the ride feel

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
the other thing is sort of the ride feel
from<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> sensor<00:02:06.689> technology

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
from all the sensor technology

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.370 
from all the sensor technology
so<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.310> measure<00:02:08.520> torque<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.990> measure

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
so we can measure torque we can measure

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.490 
so we can measure torque we can measure
rotational<00:02:11.280> speed<00:02:11.640> based<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.600> how<00:02:13.200> quickly

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
rotational speed based on how quickly

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320 
rotational speed based on how quickly
you're<00:02:13.770> spinning<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.310> pedals<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.880> bike<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you're spinning the pedals on a bike and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.780 
you're spinning the pedals on a bike and
also<00:02:16.110> wheel<00:02:16.380> speed<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:17.010> deliver<00:02:17.430> an

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
also wheel speed to deliver an

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.930 
also wheel speed to deliver an
unbelievable<00:02:18.600> ride<00:02:18.840> feel<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.640> direct

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
unbelievable ride feel that is in direct

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.650 
unbelievable ride feel that is in direct
proportion<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.960> your<00:02:22.230> human<00:02:22.590> power<00:02:22.770> input<00:02:23.310> and

proportion to your human power input and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
proportion to your human power input and
makes<00:02:24.660> experience<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> magic<00:02:25.980> carpet
