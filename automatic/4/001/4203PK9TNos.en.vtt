00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.060
 I will explain in the order of care 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.130
 The vacuum chilled room uses the vacuum pump to reduce the pressure inside the container 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.820
 Make it hypoxic 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.410
 Moreover, it comes out of food by photocatalyst 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.290
 By decomposing ethylene gas and odor into carbon dioxide gas 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.960
 Prevent freshness of food 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:51.000

 If you want to store something that generates less carbon dioxide, please set it manually in the chilled 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.950
 In the case of auto setting, it switches to the old and new ice temperature 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.950
