you know we seal everything up boil
panel<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:41.320> covers<00:02:42.320> I'm<00:02:42.740> gonna<00:02:42.890> probably

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
panel that covers I'm gonna probably

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.730 
panel that covers I'm gonna probably
repaint<00:02:43.670> them<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:45.230> because<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.620> gonna

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
repaint them just because this is gonna

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.770 
repaint them just because this is gonna
be<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:45.980> my<00:02:46.010> new<00:02:46.280> motor<00:02:46.550> for<00:02:46.670> every<00:02:47.150> car<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> use

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
be in my new motor for every car I use

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.070 
be in my new motor for every car I use
now<00:02:48.020> until<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:50.090> blows<00:02:50.360> up<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.870> get

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
now until it that it blows up and I get

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.160 
now until it that it blows up and I get
another<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.950> anyways<00:02:52.690> that's<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.990> right

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
another one but anyways that's it right

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.380 
another one but anyways that's it right
there

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
there

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.190 
there
this<00:02:56.390> transmission<00:02:58.780> looks<00:02:59.780> like<00:02:59.960> it<00:03:00.080> was

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
this transmission looks like it was

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000 
this transmission looks like it was
rebuilt<00:03:00.650> at<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.100> point<00:03:02.830> gotta<00:03:03.830> make<00:03:03.980> a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
rebuilt at one point gotta make a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.550 
rebuilt at one point gotta make a
shifter<00:03:04.430> for<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.850> don't<00:03:05.030> know

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
shifter for it I don't know

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.630 
shifter for it I don't know
I'm<00:03:06.560> thinking<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.950> making<00:03:07.220> one<00:03:07.370> off<00:03:07.520> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
I'm thinking to making one off the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.870 
I'm thinking to making one off the
tailstock<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.840> I'm<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.080> sure<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.700> might<00:03:10.700> make

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
tailstock but I'm not sure I might make

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
tailstock but I'm not sure I might make
one<00:03:11.090> up<00:03:11.450> off<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.230> block<00:03:13.010> there<00:03:13.870> we'll<00:03:14.870> see

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
one up off the block there we'll see

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.470 
one up off the block there we'll see
what<00:03:15.230> we're<00:03:15.410> gonna<00:03:15.500> make<00:03:15.770> here<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.280> go<00:03:17.270> from

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
what we're gonna make here and go from

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.640 
what we're gonna make here and go from
there<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.080> uh<00:03:18.460> I'm<00:03:19.460> not<00:03:19.520> even<00:03:19.640> sure<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.120> like

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
there but uh I'm not even sure I like

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.620 
there but uh I'm not even sure I like
with<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.920> if<00:03:22.550> that's<00:03:22.790> all<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> way<00:03:23.270> forward

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
with this if that's all the way forward

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.400 
with this if that's all the way forward
like<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:25.400> was<00:03:25.520> that<00:03:25.670> first<00:03:26.380> where's<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.590> Park

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
like it was that first where's that Park

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.060 
like it was that first where's that Park
is<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.590> Park<00:03:31.660> yeah<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.050> Park<00:03:33.350> okay

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
is that Park yeah that is Park okay

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.550 
is that Park yeah that is Park okay
that's<00:03:34.910> Park<00:03:35.680> reverse<00:03:36.820> obviously<00:03:40.510> neutral

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that's Park reverse obviously neutral

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.810 
that's Park reverse obviously neutral
drive<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.160> or<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:47.030> know<00:03:47.120> all<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> way<00:03:47.510> forward

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
drive to or you know all the way forward

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.550 
drive to or you know all the way forward
so<00:03:49.820> we're<00:03:50.360> gonna<00:03:50.450> take<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.989> off<00:03:51.050> there

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
so we're gonna take that off there

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.880 
so we're gonna take that off there
probably<00:03:52.040> put<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.300> just<00:03:53.300> up<00:03:53.420> piece<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:54.200> someone

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
probably put a just up piece up someone

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.699 
probably put a just up piece up someone
you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.100> put<00:03:55.280> shifter<00:03:56.709> it'll<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:58.459> its<00:03:58.610> thing

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you can put shifter it'll do its thing

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.810 
you can put shifter it'll do its thing
yeah<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:00.769> been<00:04:00.980> rebuilt<00:04:01.190> there's<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.670> piece

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
yeah it's been rebuilt there's a piece

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.729 
yeah it's been rebuilt there's a piece
of<00:04:01.940> silicone<00:04:02.300> here<00:04:02.540> around<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.959> sensor<00:04:03.500> so

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
of silicone here around this sensor so

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.000 
of silicone here around this sensor so
that's<00:04:03.920> obviously<00:04:04.690> it's<00:04:05.690> got<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> new<00:04:06.769> pan

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
that's obviously it's got a new pan

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.210 
that's obviously it's got a new pan
gasket<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:09.080> comes<00:04:09.290> complete<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:09.950> mean

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
gasket so it comes complete I mean
