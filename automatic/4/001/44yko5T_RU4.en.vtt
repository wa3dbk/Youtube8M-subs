00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello friends today we will learn to make a 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.870
 paper butterfly 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.100
 we will organize 6 paper and something to cut 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.680
 it's optional 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.830
 we'll start by taking out a square of 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.830
 this sheet this way this point 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.320
 and remark more 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.130
 now we have to cut this part 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.760
 That part has to be remembered 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 good since we have cut them 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 there will be a square 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.010
 this is tip 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.010
 of the other 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.310
 we do not talk 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.399
 if we flip the sheet 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.399
 we do we fold in half 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.300
 and repeating the same thing with the other side 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.800
 we turn them over and press 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.500
 through the center 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.920
 now we do the following we double 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 this form 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.299
 a ladder to national 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.240
 now it 's tip we talk up 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 or not 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.680
 suddenly repeating the same thing with the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.680
 other 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 i 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.600
 now we stir 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.750
 and that part of talking about here as 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.750
 here 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.819
 we hide 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.060
 and this fold we fold down 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.910
 now it is in this part and also 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.260
 we push and bend 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 and we repeat the same with the other 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 now we turn the account we put the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.260
 speak down 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 ah 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.570
 come up for a peak 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.430
 now we will fold in half 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.200
 thus 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.450
 then we will do it and we will see that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.830
 here we have a group mark it 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.830
 we will not go back to this form 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.159
 now have our tip 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.519
 so that you are the most symmetrical 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.519
 possible 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.860
 and where will we do this way 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.330
 you have to give something like that
