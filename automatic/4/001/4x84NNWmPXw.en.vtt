about<00:00:06.800> exacts<00:00:07.719> the<00:00:08.719> defilers<00:00:09.559> a<00:00:09.740> master<00:00:10.219> of

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
about exacts the defilers a master of

about exacts the defilers a master of
spells<00:00:10.809> it<00:00:11.809> already<00:00:12.260> spawns<00:00:12.710> burrows

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
spells it already spawns burrows

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.580 
spells it already spawns burrows
so<00:00:13.690> let's<00:00:14.690> Ambro<00:00:15.110> it<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:17.200> let's<00:00:18.200> have<00:00:18.349> a<00:00:18.410> look

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
so let's Ambro it and let's have a look

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.400 
so let's Ambro it and let's have a look
at<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:18.800> unit<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:20.180> spawns<00:00:20.510> with<00:00:20.720> around<00:00:20.990> 50

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
at the unit it spawns with around 50

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.260 
at the unit it spawns with around 50
energy<00:00:22.330> 280<00:00:23.330> health<00:00:23.779> points<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.850> 3<00:00:25.850> armor

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
energy 280 health points and 3 armor

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.529 
energy 280 health points and 3 armor
also<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.199> lot<00:00:27.470> of<00:00:27.500> spells<00:00:27.910> consumed<00:00:28.910> for<00:00:29.300> 10

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
also a lot of spells consumed for 10

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.110 
also a lot of spells consumed for 10
energy<00:00:30.310> it<00:00:31.310> has<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:32.059> darks<00:00:32.480> run<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:32.989> 60<00:00:33.470> and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
energy it has the darks run for 60 and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.549 
energy it has the darks run for 60 and
plague<00:00:35.120> for<00:00:35.629> also<00:00:36.290> 60<00:00:36.800> energy<00:00:37.159> cost<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:39.260> first

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
plague for also 60 energy cost the first

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.369 
plague for also 60 energy cost the first
thing<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.100> wanna<00:00:40.339> do<00:00:40.519> when<00:00:41.199> you<00:00:42.199> have

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
thing you wanna do when you have

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.700 
thing you wanna do when you have
selected<00:00:42.799> you<00:00:42.949> hero<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:44.299> get<00:00:45.019> some<00:00:45.229> circu

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
selected you hero is to get some circu

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.299 
selected you hero is to get some circu
Mnet's<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:47.089> increase<00:00:47.780> your<00:00:48.049> energy<00:00:48.309> you

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
Mnet's and to increase your energy you

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.259 
Mnet's and to increase your energy you
use<00:00:50.299> the<00:00:50.629> consume<00:00:51.250> ability<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.549> consume<00:00:53.150> you

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
use the consume ability and consume you

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.270 
use the consume ability and consume you
circulates<00:00:53.870> like<00:00:54.229> that<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:54.559> can<00:00:54.769> get<00:00:55.010> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
circulates like that you can get a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.109 
circulates like that you can get a
maximum<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.799> 250<00:00:57.799> energy<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:01.190> plague<00:01:01.580> ability

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
maximum of 250 energy the plague ability

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.840 
maximum of 250 energy the plague ability
can<00:01:02.479> be<00:01:02.659> great<00:01:03.080> to<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.500> part<00:01:03.830> a<00:01:04.040> push<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.729> can

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
can be great to the part a push you can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.270 
can be great to the part a push you can
see<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:05.420> we'd<00:01:05.690> like<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:06.200> lot<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.920> units

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
see that here we'd like a lot of units

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.459 
see that here we'd like a lot of units
and<00:01:07.520> their<00:01:08.479> health<00:01:08.750> points<00:01:09.170> reduced<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.310> 1

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
and their health points reduced to 1

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.080 
and their health points reduced to 1
automatically<00:01:12.469> so<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.280> no<00:01:13.490> problem<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.969> get

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
automatically so it's no problem to get

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.749 
automatically so it's no problem to get
a<00:01:14.149> lot<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.420> points<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.619> dark<00:01:15.979> swarm<00:01:16.250> ability

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
a lot of points the dark swarm ability

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.209 
a lot of points the dark swarm ability
is<00:01:17.359> also<00:01:17.780> very<00:01:18.049> strong<00:01:18.200> especially<00:01:18.799> when

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
is also very strong especially when

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.639 
is also very strong especially when
combined<00:01:19.640> with<00:01:19.759> Revis<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.049> can<00:01:21.259> see<00:01:21.439> that

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
combined with Revis you can see that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.669 
combined with Revis you can see that
here<00:01:21.979> range<00:01:22.490> units<00:01:22.909> like<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.270> dragoons<00:01:23.679> can't

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
here range units like the dragoons can't

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.410 
here range units like the dragoons can't
hit<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.969> units<00:01:26.509> under<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.770> swarm

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
hit the units under the swarm

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.990 
hit the units under the swarm
so<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.659> Reavers<00:01:29.960> have

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
so the Reavers have

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.350 
so the Reavers have
the<00:01:31.120> game<00:01:31.300> here<00:01:32.370> so<00:01:33.370> your<00:01:33.640> opponents<00:01:34.150> need

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
the game here so your opponents need

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.930 
the game here so your opponents need
some<00:01:34.600> melee<00:01:34.870> units<00:01:35.320> they<00:01:36.040> can<00:01:36.070> get<00:01:36.460> under<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
some melee units they can get under the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.740 
some melee units they can get under the
swarm<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:39.490> some<00:01:39.760> damage<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.600> see

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
swarm and do some damage you can see

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.290 
swarm and do some damage you can see
that<00:01:40.900> here<00:01:41.140> okay<00:01:41.770> I'll<00:01:42.100> stop<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.700> big<00:01:42.880> scarabs

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
that here okay I'll stop the big scarabs

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.620 
that here okay I'll stop the big scarabs
to<00:01:43.479> show<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:44.220> where<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.460> servants<00:01:45.820> can<00:01:46.120> take

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
to show you where the servants can take

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.570 
to show you where the servants can take
those<00:01:46.900> three<00:01:47.260> result

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.410 

when<00:01:52.150> you'll<00:01:52.360> only<00:01:53.020> have<00:01:53.320> some<00:01:53.760> few<00:01:54.760> sporting

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
when you'll only have some few sporting

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.500 
when you'll only have some few sporting
units<00:01:55.750> left<00:01:55.990> or<00:01:56.350> none<00:01:56.800> like<00:01:57.190> here<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.270> bullsh

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
units left or none like here the bullsh

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.810 
units left or none like here the bullsh
is<00:01:58.690> our<00:01:58.840> number<00:01:59.200> one<00:01:59.350> killer<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.740> exacts<00:02:00.220> you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
is our number one killer of exacts you

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.350 
is our number one killer of exacts you
can<00:02:01.030> see<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.360> here<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.250> range<00:02:03.250> damage<00:02:03.820> can

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
can see that here the range damage can

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.110 
can see that here the range damage can
be<00:02:04.900> stopped<00:02:05.380> by<00:02:05.530> using<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.310> darks<00:02:06.610> form<00:02:06.820> but

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
be stopped by using the darks form but

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.840 
be stopped by using the darks form but
they<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.600> lay<00:02:07.960> their<00:02:07.990> minds<00:02:08.740> even<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.730> you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
they can lay their minds even if you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.580 
they can lay their minds even if you
pull<00:02:10.090> out<00:02:10.119> they<00:02:10.450> don't<00:02:10.510> see<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.990> but<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.320> know

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
pull out they don't see you but I know

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.450 
pull out they don't see you but I know
you're<00:02:11.770> there<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.340> they<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:14.280> keep<00:02:15.280> on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
you're there so they can just go keep on

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.780 
you're there so they can just go keep on
laying<00:02:15.820> mines<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.220> you're<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> fire<00:02:18.520> will<00:02:18.760> go

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
laying mines and you're the fire will go

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.310 
laying mines and you're the fire will go
down<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:21.010> playability<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:22.210> also<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.810> really

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
down the playability can also be really

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.380 
down the playability can also be really
useful<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:26.380> some<00:02:26.860> clock<00:02:27.310> rates<00:02:27.610> visible

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
useful to make some clock rates visible

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.660 
useful to make some clock rates visible
also<00:02:28.720> versus<00:02:29.260> dark<00:02:29.410> templars<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.070> their

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
also versus dark templars and their

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.720 
also versus dark templars and their
energy<00:02:31.060> or<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.380> health<00:02:32.650> points<00:02:33.130> will<00:02:33.400> be

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
energy or the health points will be

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
energy or the health points will be
reduced<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:35.350> one<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.910> easy

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
reduced to one like here and that's easy

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.170 
reduced to one like here and that's easy
easy<00:02:38.170> points<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.640> course<00:02:39.730> they

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
easy points for you of course they

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.030 
easy points for you of course they
should<00:02:40.210> not<00:02:40.570> go<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.750> suicide<00:02:41.350> because<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
should not go and suicide because as you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.340 
should not go and suicide because as you
can<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.430> one<00:02:43.030> shot<00:02:43.600> kills<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:47.110> strong

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
can see one shot kills a really strong

can see one shot kills a really strong
combo<00:02:47.740> is<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> combine<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.520> darks<00:02:48.970> run<00:02:49.150> with<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420

combo is to combine the darks run with a
phoenix<00:02:49.930> drop<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.860> can<00:02:51.040> see<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.370> here<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
phoenix drop you can see that here you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.900 
phoenix drop you can see that here you
would<00:02:53.230> usually<00:02:53.440> go<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.130> guardians<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.700> get

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
would usually go for guardians to get

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.690 
would usually go for guardians to get
rid<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> phoenix<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.660> fast<00:02:55.930> as<00:02:56.080> possible<00:02:56.530> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
rid of phoenix as fast as possible and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.610 
rid of phoenix as fast as possible and
while<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:57.850> can't<00:02:58.450> hit<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.260> down<00:02:59.410> this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
while they just can't hit it down this

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.130 
while they just can't hit it down this
warm<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.910> only<00:03:01.060> thing<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.959> kind

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
warm so the only thing you can do kind

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.160 
warm so the only thing you can do kind
of<00:03:02.350> try<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.739> lock<00:03:03.100> down<00:03:03.250> phoenix<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:04.600> maybe

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
of try to lock down phoenix or maybe

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.400 
of try to lock down phoenix or maybe
better<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:06.010> storm<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.110> conceded<00:03:08.110> here<00:03:08.290> in

better to storm it conceded here in

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.430 
better to storm it conceded here in

kills<00:03:12.070> Phoenix<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:14.620> you're<00:03:15.280> doing<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.610> tank

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
kills Phoenix if you're doing a tank

kills Phoenix if you're doing a tank
drop<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.750> dark<00:03:16.960> swarm<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.410> also

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
drop of the dark swarm is also

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.710 
drop of the dark swarm is also
absolutely<00:03:18.460> brilliant<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.210> support<00:03:19.600> it

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
absolutely brilliant to support it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.340 
absolutely brilliant to support it
because<00:03:20.550> just<00:03:21.550> like<00:03:21.670> before<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.690> opponent's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
because just like before the opponent's

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.520 
because just like before the opponent's
will<00:03:23.620> usually<00:03:23.890> go<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.690> air<00:03:25.690> units<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.230> get<00:03:26.380> rid

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
will usually go for air units to get rid

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.950 
will usually go for air units to get rid
of<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.070> tanks<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:28.210> you<00:03:28.270> can<00:03:28.510> see<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.750> tier

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
of the tanks so you can see the tier

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.870 
of the tanks so you can see the tier
dark<00:03:29.890> swarm<00:03:30.160> casters<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:32.800> can<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.550> lot

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
dark swarm casters and that can do a lot

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.600 
dark swarm casters and that can do a lot
of<00:03:33.910> damage<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.330> me<00:03:34.780> Nexus<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.890> can<00:03:39.070> also<00:03:39.250> use

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
of damage to me Nexus you can also use

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.120 
of damage to me Nexus you can also use
play<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.300> slowly<00:03:40.810> weaken<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.440> Nexus<00:03:41.860> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
play to slowly weaken the Nexus a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.790 
play to slowly weaken the Nexus a
garrison<00:03:43.090> minutes<00:03:43.450> plague<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.620> will

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
garrison minutes plague it and it will

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.880 
garrison minutes plague it and it will
lose<00:03:45.000> some<00:03:46.000> health<00:03:46.450> points<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.710> go

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
lose some health points and you can go

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.170 
lose some health points and you can go
to<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.160> side<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.640> just<00:03:48.850> burrow

to the side and just burrow

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.630 
to the side and just burrow
stay<00:03:49.600> there<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.890> minutes<00:03:51.250> for<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
right timing you go again but you also

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.500 
right timing you go again but you also
have<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.070> pay<00:03:54.190> attention<00:03:54.250> if<00:03:54.880> your<00:03:55.060> opponent's

you to Feiler you have to run run run
and<00:04:07.990> then<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.140> can<00:04:08.410> use<00:04:08.620> teleports<00:04:09.930> response

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
and then you can use teleports response
