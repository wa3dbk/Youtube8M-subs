this<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.359> really<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.689> the<00:00:07.080> Golden<00:00:07.379> Age<00:00:07.439> of<00:00:07.589> SLR

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
this is really the the Golden Age of SLR

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.890 
this is really the the Golden Age of SLR
is<00:00:08.040> these<00:00:08.250> days<00:00:08.400> with<00:00:08.580> digital<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.240> growing

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
is these days with digital it's growing

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.630 
is these days with digital it's growing
tremendously<00:00:10.080> again<00:00:10.680> spiked<00:00:11.190> back<00:00:11.430> in<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640 
tremendously again spiked back in the

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.940 
tremendously again spiked back in the
60s<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.150> film<00:00:12.300> cameras<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.560> get<00:00:13.740> one

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
60s with film cameras now we get one

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.380 
60s with film cameras now we get one
more<00:00:14.100> lens<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> also<00:00:14.880> saw<00:00:15.270> this

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.390 
more lens here we also saw this

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.659 
more lens here we also saw this
previously<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.500> last<00:00:16.740> year's<00:00:16.949> PMA<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.519> now<00:00:17.640> I

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:17.669 
previously at last year's PMA and now I

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.550 
previously at last year's PMA and now I
gather<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.179> closer<00:00:18.929> to<00:00:19.019> being<00:00:19.259> a<00:00:19.320> product

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
gather it's closer to being a product

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.679 
gather it's closer to being a product
this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.130> Big<00:00:20.369> Bopper<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.789> called<00:00:21.089> it<00:00:21.240> okay

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this is the Big Bopper I called it okay

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.200 
this is the Big Bopper I called it okay
yes<00:00:21.929> yeah<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.949> introduced<00:00:23.429> last<00:00:23.669> year<00:00:23.849> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
yes yeah it was introduced last year in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
yes yeah it was introduced last year in
a<00:00:24.269> prototype<00:00:24.720> form<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> design<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a prototype form now the design is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
a prototype form now the design is
finalized<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.179> the<00:00:27.269> factory<00:00:27.659> is<00:00:27.779> scheduling

take<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.970> walk

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
take a look at that we have to walk

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
take a look at that we have to walk
across<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> come<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
across that one we have to come to that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.260 
across that one we have to come to that
that<00:00:38.220> won't<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> us<00:00:38.760> let's<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.240> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that won't come to us let's go take a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:01:03.420 
that won't come to us let's go take a
look

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.490 

it's<00:01:03.820> totally<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.360> listeners<00:01:05.140> what<00:01:05.320> this

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
it's totally the listeners what this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's totally the listeners what this
what<00:01:05.710> we're<00:01:05.830> looking<00:01:06.010> at<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:06.280> okay

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
what we're looking at here okay

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.140 
what we're looking at here okay
this<00:01:07.090> big<00:01:07.299> baby<00:01:07.450> here<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.760> 200<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.940> 500

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
this big baby here is a 200 to 500

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.350 
this big baby here is a 200 to 500
millimeter<00:01:10.810> zoom<00:01:11.080> lens<00:01:11.320> with<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.130> constant<00:01:12.850> 2.8

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.410 
millimeter zoom lens with a constant 2.8
maximum<00:01:13.930> aperture<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.130> making<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.729> perhaps

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
maximum aperture so making it perhaps

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.930 
maximum aperture so making it perhaps
the<00:01:16.659> fastest<00:01:17.320> 500<00:01:18.100> millimeter<00:01:18.430> telephoto

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
the fastest 500 millimeter telephoto

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.719 
the fastest 500 millimeter telephoto
lens<00:01:19.240> but<00:01:19.930> also<00:01:20.170> being<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.770> zoom<00:01:20.950> lens<00:01:21.159> being

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
lens but also being a zoom lens being

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.300 
lens but also being a zoom lens being
able<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.000> zoom<00:01:22.119> between<00:01:22.990> 500<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.649> is<00:01:23.920> as<00:01:24.130> small

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
able to zoom between 500 and is as small

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.969 
able to zoom between 500 and is as small
as<00:01:24.369> 200<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.570> be<00:01:25.720> very<00:01:25.840> useful<00:01:26.320> like<00:01:26.470> for<00:01:26.680> sports

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
as 200 so be very useful like for sports

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.180 
as 200 so be very useful like for sports
and<00:01:27.220> nature<00:01:27.759> photography<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.860> supplied

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
and nature photography it is supplied

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.149 
and nature photography it is supplied
with<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.850> matched<00:01:31.509> 2<00:01:31.960> x<00:01:32.259> teleconverter<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
with a matched 2 x teleconverter and

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.969 
with a matched 2 x teleconverter and
when<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.820> teleconverter<00:01:34.360> is<00:01:34.540> employed

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
when the teleconverter is employed

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.169 
when the teleconverter is employed
effectively<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.070> becomes<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.520> four<00:01:36.729> hundred<00:01:36.880> to

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
effectively it becomes a four hundred to

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.719 
effectively it becomes a four hundred to

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
top to see the distance scale and zoom

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.380 
top to see the distance scale and zoom
scale<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.340> engineers<00:02:06.789> have<00:02:07.000> designed<00:02:07.119> an

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
scale so the engineers have designed an

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.600 
scale so the engineers have designed an
LCD<00:02:07.750> display<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.410> back<00:02:08.440> surface<00:02:09.009> which

that's where you mentioned that's
everything's<00:02:44.620> motorized<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:45.310> just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
everything's motorized in there just

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.680 
everything's motorized in there just
playing<00:02:45.730> with<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.000> earlier<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.239> can<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.540> tell

the viewers that we're really surprised
how<00:02:48.489> fast<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.970> was<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.239> really<00:02:49.450> sloughs<00:02:49.720> very

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
how fast it was it really sloughs very

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.930 
how fast it was it really sloughs very
rapidly<00:02:50.349> for<00:02:50.620> considering<00:02:51.430> how<00:02:51.519> much<00:02:51.640> glass

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
rapidly for considering how much glass

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.250 
rapidly for considering how much glass
has<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.330> move<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.780> forth<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.080> there

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
has got to move back and forth in there

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.229 
has got to move back and forth in there
right<00:02:53.650> yeah<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:54.610> made<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> quite<00:02:55.060> an

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
right yeah they made it quite an

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.780 
right yeah they made it quite an
efficient<00:02:55.660> system<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.129> is<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
efficient system and it is a

efficient system and it is a
self-contained<00:02:58.540> power<00:02:58.930> system<00:02:59.440> there's<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
self-contained power system there's a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
