00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 The magician will keep his charge. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.000

 all the battles of the novel of turn that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.890

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.070
 this business of choosing the characters 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 of the chosen being something against the wall 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.740
