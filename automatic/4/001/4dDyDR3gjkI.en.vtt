00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
those videos about the training of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
those videos about the training of
myself<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:42.239> results<00:00:42.660> so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
myself they think that do results so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
myself they think that do results so
fast<00:00:43.140> right<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.829> first<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

most looking fool cuz you know
sarcoplasmic<00:00:47.039> hypertrophy<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy so it's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510 
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy so it's
purposeful<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.230> eventually<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.860> stays<00:00:50.190> right

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
purposeful but eventually it stays right

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.549 
purposeful but eventually it stays right
and<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.120> told<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> guys<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.140> only<00:00:52.170> stays

backs<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.890> something

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
backs up this thing is just something

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.410 
backs up this thing is just something
that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.520> observation<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.329> I'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that I got from observation if I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
that I got from observation if I'm
looking<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.840> friends<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.409> people<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.130> saw

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
looking at my friends and people I saw

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
looking at my friends and people I saw
the<00:01:35.400> body<00:01:35.700> building<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.840> train<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the body building that would train the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
the body building that would train the
muscle<00:01:38.400> every<00:01:38.490> day<00:01:38.790> without<00:01:39.150> even<00:01:39.509> knowing<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
muscle every day without even knowing it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
muscle every day without even knowing it
like<00:01:40.049> unconsciously<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.250> their

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
like unconsciously or just because their

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
like unconsciously or just because their
job<00:01:41.640> required<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> started

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
job required it and when I started

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
job required it and when I started
bodybuilding<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> study<00:01:44.490> increasing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
bodybuilding on the study increasing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.139 
bodybuilding on the study increasing
their<00:01:45.750> protein<00:01:46.320> intake<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.490> specific

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
their protein intake that that specific

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.050 
their protein intake that that specific
muscle<00:01:48.630> blew<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.590> fast<00:01:49.829> right<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
muscle blew up so fast right and I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
muscle blew up so fast right and I
explained<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:52.140> friends<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> used

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
explained my friends right when I used

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
explained my friends right when I used
to<00:01:53.310> play<00:01:53.490> football<00:01:53.700> how<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> neck

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to play football how to do a lot of neck

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
to play football how to do a lot of neck
and<00:01:54.930> traps<00:01:55.229> work<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> prevent

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and traps work to do to prevent

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
and traps work to do to prevent
concussions<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> started

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
concussions and when I started

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.990 
concussions and when I started
bodybuilding<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.130> first<00:01:59.490> connect<00:01:59.820> groove

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
bodybuilding the first connect groove

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
bodybuilding the first connect groove
was<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> tracks<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> wasn't<00:02:01.079> genetics

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
was the tracks right it wasn't genetics

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200 
was the tracks right it wasn't genetics
because<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.950> said<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:02.729> genetics

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
because like I said if your genetics

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.950 
because like I said if your genetics
around<00:02:03.750> 18<00:02:04.229> 16<00:02:04.860> 18<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.329> most<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.689> start

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
around 18 16 18 is the most gonna start

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.359 
around 18 16 18 is the most gonna start
to<00:02:07.049> show<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.890> using<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
to show not using and

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.859 
to show not using and
and<00:02:09.459> full<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.269> it's<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.539> start<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> show

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and full but it's going to start to show

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.360 
and full but it's going to start to show
when<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.170> have<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> genetic<00:02:11.650> strong<00:02:11.950> point<00:02:12.220> it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
when you have a genetic strong point it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.649 
when you have a genetic strong point it
shows<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.610> them<00:02:12.730> before<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> start<00:02:13.120> training

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
shows you them before you start training

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.670 
shows you them before you start training
and<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.659> those<00:02:16.780> cases<00:02:16.989> these<00:02:17.260> people<00:02:17.319> have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and so in those cases these people have

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.479 
and so in those cases these people have
just<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.099> average<00:02:18.940> physiques<00:02:19.379> so

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
just you know average physiques so

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.740 
just you know average physiques so
anyway<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.670> got<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:21.909> lot<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> messages<00:02:22.330> you

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
know people should not tell me

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.890 
know people should not tell me
these<00:02:24.849> guys<00:02:25.030> say<00:02:25.150> my<00:02:25.299> basket<00:02:25.599> used<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> be

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
these guys say my basket used to be

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.360 
these guys say my basket used to be
lagging<00:02:26.079> a<00:02:26.379> lot<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.769> now<00:02:26.890> started<00:02:27.250> training

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
lagging a lot but now started training

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.920 
lagging a lot but now started training
them<00:02:27.549> everyday<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.940> they're<00:02:28.450> getting<00:02:28.599> bigger

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
them everyday and they're getting bigger

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.380 
them everyday and they're getting bigger
my<00:02:29.620> vascular<00:02:30.190> obviously<00:02:30.610> with<00:02:30.819> more<00:02:30.940> vascular

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
my vascular obviously with more vascular

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.640 
my vascular obviously with more vascular
because<00:02:31.569> he's<00:02:31.690> pushing<00:02:32.019> out<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.170> blood<00:02:32.409> into

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
because he's pushing out the blood into

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.289 
because he's pushing out the blood into
it<00:02:32.769> I'm<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.250> told<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.519> guys<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
mostly make the mistakes ago and try to

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.610 
mostly make the mistakes ago and try to
do<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> heavy-ass<00:02:46.209> workouts<00:02:46.870> every<00:02:47.200> day<00:02:47.349> that's

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
do a heavy-ass workouts every day that's

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
do a heavy-ass workouts every day that's
the<00:02:47.709> number<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.459> way<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.609> burn<00:02:48.940> yourself<00:02:49.060> out

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the number one way to burn yourself out

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.000 
the number one way to burn yourself out
right<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:50.079> not<00:02:50.290> necessarily<00:02:50.739> have<00:02:50.859> your

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
right it's not necessarily have your

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.490 
right it's not necessarily have your
regular<00:02:51.190> workouts<00:02:51.819> but<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.629> every<00:02:52.959> day<00:02:53.170> go

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
regular workouts but then every day go

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.930 
regular workouts but then every day go
in<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.829> put<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.040> blood<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.549> muscle<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
in and put the blood in the muscle and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.699 
in and put the blood in the muscle and
you'd<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.209> amazed<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.049> anyway<00:02:56.230> these<00:02:56.319> monkeys

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
you'd be amazed so anyway these monkeys

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.559 
you'd be amazed so anyway these monkeys
bigger<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:57.129> vascular<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.329> people

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
bigger more vascular and then people

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.119 
bigger more vascular and then people
look<00:02:58.750> at<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:58.959> biceps<00:02:59.230> while<00:02:59.560> I'm<00:02:59.709> talking<00:02:59.890> to

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
look at my biceps while I'm talking to

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.520 
look at my biceps while I'm talking to
