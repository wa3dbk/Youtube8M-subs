00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.089
 vision could not get along 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.369

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:09.770

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.630
 I have 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.630
 I think that's from the newer types, but I've never seen one 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.869
 and you can 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.039
 to sleep 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 and check out the Sunday message 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.069
 surely 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.069
 In addition, such is 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.620
 in an earlier post 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.090
 That's not because I remember being with me anymore 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.920
 and I think this is not the case 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 the gentlemen continental 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.490
 to show 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.190
 he that there could be another child with me at all 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.490
 and 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.670
 perhaps 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.540
 it depends on my he knows or so I have 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.620
 total 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.590
 see 3 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.760
 but 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.230
 the ieperstraat 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.370
 the cia 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.780
 what a power parity that can do 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 for the people who don't know that should be possible 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.760
 the bet their bet 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.760
 hair lane year 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.970
 a baby who has been wrong but know 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 and 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.850
 we can't just do times move 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.760
 that will be difficult 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.910
 6 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.040

 contractor 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.569
 this goes 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 if you like the results 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.839
 that is video images has had to contract for this 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.070
 and yes if a beast comes so dead tired triangle 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.129
 similarly like-minded people here 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.339

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.269
