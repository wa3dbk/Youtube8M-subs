00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.710
 hi to all having all and that's 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.490
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.540
 video a bit peculiar that will not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.670
 so changed from what I do 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.650
 usually for the moment so that's 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.020
 a video I will introduce you to my 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.310
 headphones and installing a new 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.070
 visor that I was looking for 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.480
 today then the helmet is here 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.449
 it's a matte black ashton gtb 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.390
 so it's a case that I paid 150 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.650
 euros who does his job very well 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.979
 so as we can see a life with 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:54.879
 a classic visor a dual screen 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:59.860
 solar ventilation at the level of the 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.129
 mouth on the top good it's both 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.479
 only ventilation we have except that we 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:13.890
 behind exits to do well 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:17.280
 take out the hot air so over there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.280
 this is finally frankly I think that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.940
 if he does his job well and I've been 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 today bought an iridium visor 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.080
 so iridium is a reflection 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.160
 a rainbow reflection we will say so 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:42.090
 here we will see right away what that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 then give these two are perfect then 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.290
 so it's a visor that I bought 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.760
 at max s always have besides 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:02:01.630
 it's the good I buy everything and I 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:02:02.170
 am very happy then at the level of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 dismantling 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.520
 there is really nothing complicated there is 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:20.290
 two little click and hop there we go out on 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:23.980
 first side and there the second is that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.810
 it's good so I'm not good 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 for the moment we do not see well there the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.940
 color i will leave the protection 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.500
 during the installation of the shot it is not 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 obvious because we see more through 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.580
 that's it in there is the clip this good clip 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.390
 frankly that's it all alone 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.390
 really change nothing laughs and complicated 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.830
 good even if I wanted you galley I a 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.830
 little 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:26.300
 so here's the click is in it's long 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.300
 and so we'll see what it's like 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.010
 a magnificent magnificent 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 so frankly I'm happy because 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.850
 that I did not know what I did not know 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 really what to expect because 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.420
 iridium visors are of all 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 colors 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.140
 so there when I ordered them I 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.630
 not seen so I ordered a chrome 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.880
 rank rainbow so I did not know the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.390
 all that was going to give and 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.390
 frankly I think it's stupid 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.550
 good after I do not know I hope that from 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.530
 the interior was not too much 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.680
 opaque either because the night is 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:27.760
 boring otherwise it seems to be going 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.890
 good there it's cool good ben voila I think 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 that this is the end of the video I hope 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.100
 that you will have liked 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.540
 then at the driving level because 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.160
 that yes it's a motorcycle chain that 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.790
 for now do not have a motorcycle yet 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.400
 not stupid so soon I have planned 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.380
 a video about a derby ride 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.080
 so here and at the good ones at the level of 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.100
 allowed I'm still at the code so there 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.770
 it's starting to come good and I think 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.560
 around mid September or 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.150
 October we will have 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.570
 oh no no because I say no more 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.280
 far here's 6 6 is way I think 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.500
 october there will be the first 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.700
 the first hours of driving so 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.590
 that I will share with you of course 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.550
 so here we are later 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.550
 Hi everybody
