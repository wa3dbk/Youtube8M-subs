why<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:30.130> would<00:04:30.490> never<00:04:30.639> make<00:04:30.940> an<00:04:31.120> Ironman<00:04:31.479> pardon

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
why I would never make an Ironman pardon

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.860 
why I would never make an Ironman pardon
what<00:04:32.199> account<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.740> fuck<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.400> this

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
what account what the fuck is this

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.210 
what account what the fuck is this
that's<00:04:34.870> definitely<00:04:35.349> the<00:04:35.470> world<00:04:35.740> going<00:04:36.009> down

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
that's definitely the world going down

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.370 
that's definitely the world going down
because<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:37.060> going<00:04:37.300> fine<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.690> think<00:04:37.990> I'm

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
because this is going fine I think I'm

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.610 
because this is going fine I think I'm
able<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.979> move<00:04:39.250> in<00:04:39.460> everything<00:04:39.910> but<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.900> no

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
able to move in everything but this no

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.129 
able to move in everything but this no
it's<00:04:42.160> probably<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.580> hilt<00:04:42.880> drop<00:04:43.150> product<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.960> just

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
it's probably a hilt drop product I just

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.770 
it's probably a hilt drop product I just
missed<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:48.030> don't<00:04:49.030> think<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.240> could<00:04:49.389> even<00:04:49.509> get

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
missed it I don't think I could even get

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.300 
missed it I don't think I could even get
back<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.199> room<00:04:50.560> come<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.949> guess<00:04:51.160> it's

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
back in that room come I guess it's

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.610 
back in that room come I guess it's
instance<00:04:51.880> like<00:04:52.210> if<00:04:52.599> you<00:04:52.750> log<00:04:52.960> out<00:04:53.139> do<00:04:53.349> you<00:04:53.440> lose

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
instance like if you log out do you lose

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.219 
instance like if you log out do you lose
it<00:04:53.770> or<00:04:53.919> something<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.729> is<00:04:54.789> say<00:04:55.509> oh<00:04:56.789> shit

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
think this is worth around 2.2 mil but

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.320 
think this is worth around 2.2 mil but

section Bulls like I said before but
this<00:05:24.580> setup<00:05:25.180> is<00:05:25.449> I<00:05:25.720> mean<00:05:25.870> it's<00:05:25.990> not<00:05:26.080> really<00:05:26.259> a

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
this setup is I mean it's not really a

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.230 
this setup is I mean it's not really a
big<00:05:26.380> deal<00:05:26.560> okay<00:05:26.680> arcs<00:05:27.069> or<00:05:27.220> extensions<00:05:27.849> you

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
big deal okay arcs or extensions you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.550 
big deal okay arcs or extensions you
rate<00:05:28.419> bar<00:05:28.630> middle<00:05:28.840> boss<00:05:29.020> either<00:05:29.289> way

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860
