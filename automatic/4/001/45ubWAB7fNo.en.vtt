because if you put like too much on your
face<00:02:49.310> your<00:02:50.000> face<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.690> become<00:02:51.020> dry<00:02:52.000> because

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
face your face will become dry because

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.410 
face your face will become dry because
at<00:02:53.270> first<00:02:53.570> time<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.200> was<00:02:54.890> thinking<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.090> put

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
at first time I was thinking if you put

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
at first time I was thinking if you put
more<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.990> like<00:02:57.550> like<00:02:58.550> mogul<00:02:59.320> and<00:03:00.320> then<00:03:00.560> like

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
more it's like like mogul and then like

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.690 
more it's like like mogul and then like
maybe<00:03:02.240> in<00:03:02.540> my<00:03:02.720> face<00:03:02.990> will<00:03:03.260> become<00:03:03.800> much<00:03:04.370> more

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
maybe in my face will become much more

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.729 
maybe in my face will become much more
better<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.860> faster<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.390> was<00:03:08.840> wrong

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
better and faster but then I was wrong

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.370 
better and faster but then I was wrong
that's<00:03:10.700> why<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.720> can't<00:03:12.640> using<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.380> treatment

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
that's why you can't using the treatment

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.940 
that's why you can't using the treatment
which<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.890> fans<00:03:16.850> are<00:03:17.090> poor<00:03:17.420> parasites<00:03:18.350> too

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
which is fans are poor parasites too

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.170 
which is fans are poor parasites too
much<00:03:19.190> because<00:03:19.610> it's<00:03:20.000> not<00:03:20.480> good<00:03:20.900> because<00:03:22.180> like
