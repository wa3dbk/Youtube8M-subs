because you could use that on this song
or<00:00:46.870> lots<00:00:47.409> of<00:00:47.530> other<00:00:47.649> songs<00:00:50.039> okay<00:00:51.039> this<00:00:51.369> is<00:00:51.519> that

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
that are waltz time because you can

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.579 
that are waltz time because you can
always<00:00:57.610> think<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.059> waltz<00:00:58.269> as<00:00:58.479> being<00:00:59.229> half

measures<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.250> 6/8<00:01:00.640> if<00:01:00.909> you<00:01:01.539> look<00:01:01.719> at<00:01:01.869> the<00:01:02.049> at

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
measures of 6/8 if you look at the at

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.460 
measures of 6/8 if you look at the at
the<00:01:02.589> strum<00:01:03.489> diagram<00:01:03.909> here<00:01:04.180> you'll<00:01:04.929> see<00:01:05.199> that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
the strum diagram here you'll see that

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.240 
the strum diagram here you'll see that
we've<00:01:06.280> got<00:01:06.630> strokes

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we've got strokes

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.120 
we've got strokes
strums<00:01:09.250> both<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:09.759> black<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.679> white<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.920> white

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
strums both in black and white the white

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.210 
strums both in black and white the white
ones<00:01:12.399> are<00:01:12.550> what<00:01:13.479> are<00:01:13.569> called<00:01:13.720> ghost<00:01:14.170> brokes

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
ones are what are called ghost brokes

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.340 
ones are what are called ghost brokes
that<00:01:15.550> is<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.940> say<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.600> move<00:01:16.750> your<00:01:16.929> hand<00:01:17.110> but

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
that is to say you move your hand but

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.719 
that is to say you move your hand but
you<00:01:17.380> don't<00:01:17.590> actually<00:01:17.740> hit<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.159> strings<00:01:18.429> and

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
you don't actually hit the strings and

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.580 
you don't actually hit the strings and
so<00:01:18.880> they're<00:01:19.060> kind<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.539> silent<00:01:19.929> although<00:01:20.110> every

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
so they're kind of silent although every

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.109 
so they're kind of silent although every
once<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.890> while<00:01:21.009> because<00:01:21.310> you're<00:01:21.460> still

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
once in a while because you're still

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.300 
once in a while because you're still
doing<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:23.080> can<00:01:23.229> kind<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.470> dip<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.100> pic

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
doing this you can kind of dip the pic

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.859 
doing this you can kind of dip the pic
down<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> little<00:01:24.789> bit<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.539> get<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> little

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
down a little bit and you get a little

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.480 
down a little bit and you get a little
bit<00:01:26.049> of<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.319> stroke<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:26.890> kind<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.340> adds

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
bit of that stroke and it kind of adds

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.160 
bit of that stroke and it kind of adds
variety<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:28.000> makes<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.569> interesting<00:01:28.720> so

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
variety it makes it interesting so

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.680 
variety it makes it interesting so
you'll<00:01:29.890> notice<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.880> first<00:01:31.090> line<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
you'll notice that the first line of the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.690 
you'll notice that the first line of the
pattern<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.049> just<00:01:32.259> two<00:01:32.440> measures<00:01:32.770> here<00:01:33.039> to

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
pattern is just two measures here to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.919 
pattern is just two measures here to
six-feet<00:01:34.479> measures<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.740> first<00:01:36.039> line<00:01:36.929> I'm

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
six-feet measures the first line I'm

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.859 
six-feet measures the first line I'm
just<00:01:38.200> playing<00:01:38.500> down<00:01:39.190> strokes<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.660> beats

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
just playing down strokes on the beats

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.300 
just playing down strokes on the beats
on<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.679> two<00:01:42.280> three<00:01:43.090> four<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:44.349> at<00:01:44.560> four<00:01:45.009> the

on one two three four then at four the
end<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.849> four<00:01:46.179> we<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:46.979> upstroke<00:01:47.979> that's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
end of four we have a upstroke that's

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.749 
end of four we have a upstroke that's
not<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> ghost<00:01:48.610> stroke<00:01:48.970> then<00:01:49.750> down<00:01:50.709> on<00:01:51.069> five<00:01:51.550> and

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
not a ghost stroke then down on five and

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.960 
not a ghost stroke then down on five and
six<00:01:51.819> all<00:01:52.629> the<00:01:52.989> other<00:01:53.140> up<00:01:53.440> up<00:01:54.250> strokes<00:01:54.759> our

six all the other up up strokes our
ghost<00:01:55.300> strokes<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.989> that<00:01:56.140> sounds<00:01:56.619> like<00:01:57.060> one

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
ghost strokes so that sounds like one

beat be the note
it's<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.959> chord<00:04:06.350> you're<00:04:06.530> playing<00:04:06.560> like<00:04:07.160> in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
it's the chord you're playing like in

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.920 
it's the chord you're playing like in
this<00:04:07.459> case<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:07.790> playing<00:04:08.000> D<00:04:08.240> string<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.780> D

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
this case I'm playing D string for the D

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.510 
this case I'm playing D string for the D
chord

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.810 

and<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.090> make<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.660> four<00:04:13.050> Veet<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.370> different

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
and to make the four Veet be a different

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.190 
and to make the four Veet be a different
string<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.240> different<00:04:15.570> bass<00:04:15.720> string<00:04:15.990> in<00:04:16.110> this

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
string a different bass string in this

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.930 
string a different bass string in this
case<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.620> would<00:04:16.770> try<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.040> fifth<00:04:17.400> string<00:04:17.670> that's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
case I would try the fifth string that's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.790 
case I would try the fifth string that's
open<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.500> get<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> sound<00:04:19.950> like

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.220 

this<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.920> often<00:04:26.100> called<00:04:26.280> alternating<00:04:27.120> base<00:04:27.450> is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
this is often called alternating base is

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.869 
this is often called alternating base is
it<00:04:28.440> all<00:04:28.620> chase<00:04:28.890> between<00:04:29.250> those<00:04:29.610> two<00:04:29.820> notes

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.999 

kind<00:04:33.879> of<00:04:33.969> makes<00:04:34.149> the<00:04:34.330> pattern<00:04:34.539> field<00:04:35.610> longer

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
kind of makes the pattern field longer

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:49.629 
kind of makes the pattern field longer
but<00:04:38.819> still<00:04:39.119> has<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.449> waltz

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.520 

okay<00:04:50.270> so<00:04:50.330> if<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:50.599> put<00:04:50.900> these<00:04:51.050> two<00:04:51.110> together

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
okay so if we put these two together

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.640 
okay so if we put these two together
let's<00:04:52.189> just<00:04:52.729> recap<00:04:53.150> first<00:04:53.569> one<00:04:53.840> was<00:04:54.050> was
