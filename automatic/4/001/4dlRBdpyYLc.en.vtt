00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 learning to play clinks 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.390
 so hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.140
 sofa 12 and today we are already in dota 2 on 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:45.500
 sagzi driver driver all pick 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:47.629
 here today is a great idea to take clinkz 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 acres peak without even thinking about the possible 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.590
 appearance in the enemy time of Zeus or 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.140
 bounty hunter im still a slardar not 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.150
 enough to complete happiness the same logic 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.530
 the man who took the river does not give in 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.799
 no comprehension 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.890
 so say apache 2 with some waited 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:06.620
 distant fire arrows 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 i like fire arrows this 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.640
 great, how do you explain 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.619
 appearance of a boot in your inventory though 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.150
 Why am I asking for this boots for a long time 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.860
 became a symbol of inferiority 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:23.619
 acute need 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:26.000
 creating scale guides attention gentlemen 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.350
 get ready for a breathtaking battle 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.270
 in which the number of clicks on 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.980
 keyboard exceeds the highest 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.980
 docker performance 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.810
 killed one 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.700
 I have only two questions first 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.039
 why is zeus so stupid 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.259
 but probably these are rhetorical questions during 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.659
 second since when are the clinks arrows 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.030
 became one of the variations of the golden rain 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:15.079
 strange but humor among developers 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:19.970
 dota and those who want to run and 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:34.840
 hiding in caves Well who does not 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:37.819
 hid I won't ask for a mug she 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 he asks the courier it would be funny if 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.599
 would the courier be not give them up for 15 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.840
 minute would answer him as follows 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.840
 fuck it 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.620
 ulta did not have time to shove 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.840
 Christmas trees are really invisible 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.290
 perfectly saves from ulty 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.290
 Zeus 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:17.170
 okay I think we stand then 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.389
 here agree that this is the most 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.489
 smart excuse of all possible 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.769
 for example and if you clinkz happy 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.109
 schmitt in all possible ways forgetting 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.090
 at the same time that Zeus has your country 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:42.189
 inviz then on all attacks from the side 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:46.290
 teammates you can answer the following for 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:49.900
 of papers and years of batko nobody to climb 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.299
 Azef here I probably can not not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.400
 agree and in order to reflect with her 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.510
 Zeus's unenviable position I decided 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.510
 make a miniature 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.199
 Well, it is worth noting that all further 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:57.020
 Guide held a scuffle of Zeus and 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:57.020
 life and live hold . 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.690
 all this was accompanied by hysterical 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.490
 student shouts to the accompaniment 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.690
 from morse code we beat it with 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.690
 its keyboard 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.060
 I never got lucky in the first game 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.240
 skill and ult and he barely collected pt 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.570
 mkb and demonitsy stating the following 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.730
 and the daughter is to play well, here we come to 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.890
 end dear friends and summing up 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.510
 I want to do it without further ado 1 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.220
 laconic phrases that would be perfect 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.560
 reflected my attitude to this 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.240
 brilliant Kaido pizza and I know 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.630
 I will do the same as the hero of this 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:52.140
