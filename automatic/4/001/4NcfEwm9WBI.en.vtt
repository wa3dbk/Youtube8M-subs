how's it going guys welcome to the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.820 
how's it going guys welcome to the
seventh<00:00:05.240> argument<00:00:05.660> tutorial<00:00:06.140> in<00:00:06.319> which<00:00:06.589> we're

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
seventh argument tutorial in which we're

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.980 
seventh argument tutorial in which we're
going<00:00:07.009> to<00:00:07.129> discuss<00:00:07.640> what<00:00:08.330> are<00:00:08.420> the<00:00:08.510> basic

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
going to discuss what are the basic

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.020 
going to discuss what are the basic
concepts<00:00:09.500> that<00:00:09.770> I<00:00:09.799> wanted<00:00:10.100> to<00:00:10.160> discuss<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:10.760> long

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
concepts that I wanted to discuss a long

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.150 
concepts that I wanted to discuss a long
time<00:00:11.270> ago<00:00:11.539> but<00:00:11.719> never<00:00:11.869> got<00:00:12.199> around<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.709> it<00:00:12.830> so

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
time ago but never got around to it so

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.150 
time ago but never got around to it so
that<00:00:14.150> would<00:00:14.270> be<00:00:14.449> button<00:00:15.049> debouncing<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.039> as

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
that would be button debouncing so as

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.980 
that would be button debouncing so as
you<00:00:16.250> can<00:00:16.369> see<00:00:16.430> I<00:00:16.580> have<00:00:16.760> a<00:00:16.820> small<00:00:16.910> setup<00:00:17.750> where<00:00:17.930> I

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
you can see I have a small setup where I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.589 
you can see I have a small setup where I
have<00:00:18.199> two<00:00:18.439> LEDs<00:00:18.859> on<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.279> bread<00:00:19.490> board<00:00:19.759> along

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
have two LEDs on the bread board along

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.779 
have two LEDs on the bread board along
with<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.839> button<00:00:21.349> which<00:00:21.859> is<00:00:21.890> used<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.550> toggle

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
with a button which is used to toggle

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.019 
with a button which is used to toggle
the<00:00:23.509> LEDs<00:00:24.109> and<00:00:24.550> currently<00:00:25.550> there<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:25.880> no

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
the LEDs and currently there is no

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.060 
the LEDs and currently there is no
button<00:00:26.269> debouncing<00:00:26.990> present<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.829> my

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
button debouncing present and my

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.149 
button debouncing present and my
software<00:00:28.669> or<00:00:28.999> hardware<00:00:29.509> as<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.470> can<00:00:30.619> see<00:00:30.859> if<00:00:31.009> I

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:31.159 
software or hardware as you can see if I

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.450 
software or hardware as you can see if I
if<00:00:32.090> I<00:00:32.300> keep<00:00:32.540> just<00:00:32.780> pressing<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.320> button<00:00:33.680> you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
if I keep just pressing the button you

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.600 
if I keep just pressing the button you
would<00:00:34.610> see<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.910> LEDs<00:00:35.300> blinking<00:00:35.750> sometimes<00:00:36.610> so

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
would see the LEDs blinking sometimes so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.240 
would see the LEDs blinking sometimes so
I'm<00:00:38.390> going<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.810> discuss<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.350> concept<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:40.040> the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
I'm going to discuss the concept of the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.460 
I'm going to discuss the concept of the
whole<00:00:40.330> button<00:00:41.330> debouncing<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.230> what's

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
whole button debouncing and what's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.670 
whole button debouncing and what's
happening<00:00:42.950> exactly<00:00:43.130> in<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.760> separate<00:00:44.240> video

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
happening exactly in a separate video

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.680 
happening exactly in a separate video
but<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.710> actually<00:00:45.890> wanted<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.400> show<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.820> what

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
but I actually wanted to show you what

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.450 
but I actually wanted to show you what
is<00:00:47.780> actually<00:00:48.140> happening<00:00:48.590> in<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.860> hardware<00:00:49.250> so

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
is actually happening in the hardware so

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.090 
is actually happening in the hardware so
as<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:49.730> can<00:00:49.850> see<00:00:49.910> sometimes<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.720> press<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
as you can see sometimes I press and the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.330 
as you can see sometimes I press and the
LEDs<00:00:52.550> quickly<00:00:53.180> blink<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.920> don't<00:00:55.100> just

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
LEDs quickly blink and they don't just

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.010 
LEDs quickly blink and they don't just
saw<00:00:55.610> as<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.300> would<00:00:56.510> expect<00:00:56.630> them<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:58.060> so<00:00:59.060> let's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
saw as you would expect them to so let's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.750 
saw as you would expect them to so let's
take<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.230> look<00:01:00.440> at<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.650> code<00:01:00.890> what<00:01:01.160> which<00:01:01.640> I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
take a look at the code what which I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.420 
take a look at the code what which I
have<00:01:01.940> right<00:01:02.150> now<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.660> see<00:01:02.960> how<00:01:03.200> we<00:01:03.830> can<00:01:04.100> first

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
have right now and see how we can first

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.899 
have right now and see how we can first
of<00:01:04.549> all<00:01:05.109> debounce<00:01:06.109> and<00:01:06.499> software<00:01:07.429> and<00:01:07.670> then

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
of all debounce and software and then

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.209 
of all debounce and software and then
I'm<00:01:08.210> also<00:01:08.570> going<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.200> explain<00:01:09.590> how<00:01:09.649> you<00:01:09.859> can

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
I'm also going to explain how you can

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.539 
I'm also going to explain how you can
debounce<00:01:10.939> in<00:01:11.240> hardware<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:12.950> stay<00:01:13.340> tuned

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
debounce in hardware so stay tuned

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.120 
debounce in hardware so stay tuned
alright<00:01:14.359> so<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:14.719> can<00:01:14.869> look<00:01:15.140> at<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.439> sketch

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
alright so they can look at the sketch

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.099 
alright so they can look at the sketch
that<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.369> have<00:01:16.579> currently<00:01:16.999> uploaded<00:01:17.539> in<00:01:17.659> on<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
that I have currently uploaded in on the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.830 
that I have currently uploaded in on the
Arduino<00:01:18.469> as<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.369> can<00:01:19.520> see<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:19.999> a<00:01:20.270> button

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
Arduino as you can see I have a button

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.260 
Arduino as you can see I have a button
and<00:01:21.049> two<00:01:21.380> LEDs<00:01:21.890> declared<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:22.609> also<00:01:22.909> have<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
and two LEDs declared I also have a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.770 
and two LEDs declared I also have a
boolean<00:01:23.659> for<00:01:24.999> to<00:01:25.999> keep<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.329> state<00:01:26.569> of<00:01:26.689> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
boolean for to keep the state of the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.950 
boolean for to keep the state of the
button<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.469> have<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.859> toggle<00:01:28.280> which<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:29.659> also

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
button and I have a toggle which is also

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.349 
button and I have a toggle which is also
a<00:01:30.109> boolean<00:01:30.649> I'm<00:01:31.189> going<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.670> explain<00:01:31.969> that<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:32.270> a

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
a boolean I'm going to explain that in a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.359 
a boolean I'm going to explain that in a
second<00:01:32.719> what<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:32.960> does<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.469> setup

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
second what it does in the setup

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.870 
second what it does in the setup
function<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:34.819> have<00:01:35.139> two<00:01:36.139> LEDs<00:01:36.619> as<00:01:36.889> output<00:01:37.490> one

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
function I have two LEDs as output one

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.200 
function I have two LEDs as output one
button<00:01:38.240> as<00:01:38.389> an<00:01:38.749> input<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.030> arbitrarily<00:01:41.030> I

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
button as an input and arbitrarily I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.440 
button as an input and arbitrarily I
have<00:01:41.359> declared<00:01:41.719> two<00:01:41.840> LEDs<00:01:42.380> one<00:01:42.799> high<00:01:43.069> one<00:01:43.399> low

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
have declared two LEDs one high one low

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.539 
have declared two LEDs one high one low
just<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.659> starting<00:01:45.109> purposes<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.369> loop

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
just for starting purposes and the loop

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.120 
just for starting purposes and the loop
as<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.030> see<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.270> write<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.899> digital<00:01:48.469> read<00:01:48.859> of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
as you can see I write a digital read of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.480 
as you can see I write a digital read of
the<00:01:49.340> button<00:01:49.700> high<00:01:49.999> and<00:01:50.359> if<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> case

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the button high and if that is the case

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.370 
the button high and if that is the case
I'm<00:01:52.819> going<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.389> say<00:01:53.569> that<00:01:53.749> the<00:01:53.869> button<00:01:54.200> is

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
I'm going to say that the button is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.269 
I'm going to say that the button is
pressed<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.240> set<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.539> true<00:01:56.840> otherwise<00:01:57.829> it

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
pressed that is set to true otherwise it

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.029 
pressed that is set to true otherwise it
is<00:01:58.459> false<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.359> toggle<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.869> false<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.859> what

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
is false and the toggle is false so what

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.459 
is false and the toggle is false so what
this<00:02:01.189> creates<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.789> situation<00:02:02.209> where<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.170> can

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
this creates is a situation where I can

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.379 
this creates is a situation where I can
actually<00:02:04.159> check<00:02:04.429> if<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.850> button<00:02:05.149> has<00:02:05.359> been

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
actually check if the button has been

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.590 
actually check if the button has been
pressed<00:02:05.749> once<00:02:06.289> or<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.950> has<00:02:07.189> been<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:08.360> held

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
pressed once or it has been just held

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.320 
pressed once or it has been just held
down<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.679> what<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.280> basically<00:02:10.580> means<00:02:10.909> is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
down and what that basically means is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.539 
down and what that basically means is
that<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.349> just<00:02:12.379> hold<00:02:12.739> my<00:02:12.950> finger<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
that if I just hold my finger on the

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:13.960 
that if I just hold my finger on the
button

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
button

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.570 
button
I'm<00:02:14.150> not<00:02:14.510> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.320> keep<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.040> toggling

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
I'm not going to just keep on toggling

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.400 
I'm not going to just keep on toggling
the<00:02:16.670> LEDs<00:02:17.120> during<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.570> process<00:02:17.810> I'm<00:02:18.170> only

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the LEDs during that process I'm only

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.760 
the LEDs during that process I'm only
going<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.890> toggle<00:02:19.070> at<00:02:19.310> once<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.440> once<00:02:21.440> again

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
going to toggle at once so once again

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.180 
going to toggle at once so once again
because<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:23.110> issue<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.980> check

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
because of that issue I have to check

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.570 
because of that issue I have to check
for<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> button<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.360> pressed<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:27.770> true<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
for if the button is pressed is true and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.400 
for if the button is pressed is true and
the<00:02:28.880> toggle<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.360> currently<00:02:29.870> false<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.380> that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the toggle is currently false so that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.290 
the toggle is currently false so that
means<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.370> toggle<00:02:31.730> has<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.090> been

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
means that the toggle has not been

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.410 
means that the toggle has not been
executed<00:02:32.990> yet<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.430> if<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:35.030> has<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.360> been

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
executed yet so it if it has not been

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.170 
executed yet so it if it has not been
executed<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.260> execute<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> once<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.820> set<00:02:38.060> it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
executed I execute it once so I set it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.690 
executed I execute it once so I set it
to<00:02:38.300> true<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.620> execute<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.520> function

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
to true and I execute the function

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.900 
to true and I execute the function
toggle<00:02:41.330> which<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.540> basically<00:02:42.130> setting<00:02:43.130> LED

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
toggle which is basically setting LED

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.449 
toggle which is basically setting LED
LEDs<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> opposite<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:46.010> what<00:02:46.070> they

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
LEDs to the opposite of the of what they

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.490 
LEDs to the opposite of the of what they
currently<00:02:46.700> are<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.830> order<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.190> make<00:02:49.520> this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
currently are so in order to make this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.530 
currently are so in order to make this
fukin<00:02:51.500> debounce<00:02:52.370> able<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
fukin debounce able I'm going to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.160 
fukin debounce able I'm going to
actually<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:54.680> ahead<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.040> add<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:56.030> condition<00:02:56.720> so

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
actually go ahead and add a condition so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.130 
actually go ahead and add a condition so
I'm<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.560> add<00:02:57.740> an<00:02:57.920> int<00:02:58.240> bounce<00:02:59.240> which<00:02:59.870> is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
I'm going to add an int bounce which is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.030 
I'm going to add an int bounce which is
which<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.980> set<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.430> zero<00:03:01.700> for<00:03:02.000> now

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
which I'm going to set to zero for now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.800 
which I'm going to set to zero for now
I'm<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.580> change<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.150> button<00:03:05.660> is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
I'm going to change this button is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.410 
I'm going to change this button is
pressed<00:03:06.280> true<00:03:07.280> because<00:03:07.640> I'm<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.120> add<00:03:08.390> a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
pressed true because I'm going to add a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.830 
pressed true because I'm going to add a
condition<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.580> high<00:03:10.850> I'm<00:03:11.180> going<00:03:11.630> to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
condition so if it is high I'm going to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.690 
condition so if it is high I'm going to
simply<00:03:12.290> increment<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:14.390> bounce<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.980> we're

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
simply increment the bounce so we're

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.570 
simply increment the bounce so we're
going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.000> increment<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.660> bounce<00:03:18.340> we're<00:03:19.340> also

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
going to increment the bounce we're also

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.900 
going to increment the bounce we're also
going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.120> say<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.830> bounce<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.430> going<00:03:22.730> to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
going to say that the bounce is going to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.970 
going to say that the bounce is going to
be<00:03:23.060> reset<00:03:23.870> back<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.200> zero<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:26.060> case<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.980> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
be reset back to zero in case of the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.979 
be reset back to zero in case of the
button<00:03:28.310> not<00:03:28.550> being<00:03:28.880> pressed<00:03:29.180> anymore<00:03:29.630> or<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
button not being pressed anymore or the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.960 
button not being pressed anymore or the
button<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.650> back<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.280> low<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.430> are<00:03:34.459> also

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
button going back to low and we are also

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.190 
button going back to low and we are also
going<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.810> add<00:03:36.170> an<00:03:36.560> if<00:03:36.800> statement<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.850> if

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
going to add an if statement so if

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.759 
going to add an if statement so if
debounce<00:03:39.940> bigger<00:03:40.940> equal<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.350> have

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
debounce bigger equal to and I have

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.460 
debounce bigger equal to and I have
tested<00:03:43.010> several<00:03:43.430> values<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.660> case<00:03:44.959> so

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
tested several values for this case so

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.699 
tested several values for this case so
in<00:03:45.830> my<00:03:46.459> case<00:03:46.820> 5000<00:03:47.690> worked<00:03:47.870> pretty<00:03:48.140> well<00:03:48.500> you

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
in my case 5000 worked pretty well you

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.220 
in my case 5000 worked pretty well you
can<00:03:48.890> experiment<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.610> your<00:03:49.790> own<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:50.720> value<00:03:51.140> is

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
can experiment on your own this value is

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
can experiment on your own this value is
basically<00:03:51.440> going<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:52.040> indicate<00:03:52.430> how<00:03:52.820> long<00:03:52.880> you

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
basically going to indicate how long you

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.470 
basically going to indicate how long you
wait<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.860> be<00:03:54.890> certain<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.060> button<00:03:56.360> is

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
wait to be certain that the button is

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.840 
wait to be certain that the button is
actually<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.290> bouncing<00:03:57.739> any<00:03:57.860> more<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:58.730> you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
actually not bouncing any more so you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.729 
actually not bouncing any more so you
may<00:03:59.120> set<00:03:59.390> this<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.780> something<00:04:00.170> lower<00:04:00.380> it

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
may set this to something lower it

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.640 
may set this to something lower it
depends<00:04:01.220> on<00:04:01.310> your<00:04:01.489> on<00:04:01.670> many<00:04:02.090> factors<00:04:02.650> notably

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
depends on your on many factors notably

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.170 
depends on your on many factors notably
your<00:04:03.860> button<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:06.140> in<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:06.680> case<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.310> am<00:04:08.000> going

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
your button so in this case I am going

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.030 
your button so in this case I am going
to<00:04:08.420> say<00:04:08.600> button<00:04:09.049> pressed<00:04:10.030> equals<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.239> true

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
to say button pressed equals to true

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.000 
to say button pressed equals to true
and<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:14.330> should<00:04:14.629> be<00:04:14.659> about<00:04:14.959> all<00:04:15.379> we<00:04:15.560> need<00:04:15.769> for

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
and this should be about all we need for

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.849 
and this should be about all we need for
button<00:04:16.310> D<00:04:16.459> bouncing<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.150> let's<00:04:17.709> check<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
button D bouncing so let's check the

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.189 
button D bouncing so let's check the
sketch<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.340> upload<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.120> once<00:04:20.690> again<00:04:20.840> this

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
sketch and upload it and once again this

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.200 
sketch and upload it and once again this
is<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.769> value<00:04:22.990> which<00:04:23.990> indicates<00:04:24.880> how<00:04:25.880> long

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
is the value which indicates how long

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.110 
is the value which indicates how long
you<00:04:27.199> need<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.490> wait<00:04:28.490> before<00:04:30.550> accepting<00:04:31.550> that

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
you need to wait before accepting that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.000 
you need to wait before accepting that
the<00:04:32.630> button<00:04:33.320> was<00:04:34.160> pressed<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:36.620> just<00:04:36.889> to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
the button was pressed so just to

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.010 
the button was pressed so just to
explain<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.850> little<00:04:37.880> bit<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.539> may<00:04:38.690> set

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
explain this a little bit you may set

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.620 
explain this a little bit you may set
this<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.620> lower<00:04:39.949> lower<00:04:40.610> value<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.449> for

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this to a lower lower value so for

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.890 
this to a lower lower value so for
example<00:04:42.050> 500<00:04:42.650> or<00:04:42.830> even<00:04:43.160> 50<00:04:43.639> but<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.479> lower<00:04:44.690> you

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
example 500 or even 50 but the lower you

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.830 
example 500 or even 50 but the lower you
set<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.979> less<00:04:46.220> time<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:47.180> give<00:04:47.389> yourself

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
set it the less time you give yourself

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.830 
set it the less time you give yourself
to<00:04:47.960> pick<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.470> D<00:04:48.710> bones<00:04:48.949> so<00:04:49.910> preferably<00:04:50.750> you

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
to pick the D bones so preferably you

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.689 
to pick the D bones so preferably you
would<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.169> to<00:04:51.350> set<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:51.590> as<00:04:51.830> long<00:04:52.100> as<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.430> can

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
would like to set it as long as you can

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.590 
would like to set it as long as you can
without<00:04:53.120> having<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.870> delay<00:04:54.289> in<00:04:55.160> your<00:04:55.220> button<00:04:55.669> so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
without having a delay in your button so

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.920 
without having a delay in your button so
let's<00:04:56.630> take<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.050> look<00:04:57.289> at<00:04:57.410> what<00:04:57.560> our<00:04:58.479> same<00:04:59.479> setup

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
let's take a look at what our same setup

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.930 
let's take a look at what our same setup
does<00:05:00.169> right<00:05:00.620> now<00:05:02.169> alright<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:03.320> we<00:05:03.410> have<00:05:03.440> our<00:05:03.940> D

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
does right now alright so we have our D

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.210 
does right now alright so we have our D
bouncing<00:05:05.389> implemented<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.199> as<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.770> can<00:05:06.949> see

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
bouncing implemented so as you can see

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.730 
bouncing implemented so as you can see
no<00:05:07.910> matter<00:05:07.940> how<00:05:08.389> hard<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.169> try<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:10.760> LEDs<00:05:11.240> are

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
no matter how hard I try the LEDs are

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.020 
no matter how hard I try the LEDs are
responding<00:05:12.740> perfectly<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.520> my<00:05:13.669> button

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
responding perfectly to my button

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.270 
responding perfectly to my button
presses<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:15.380> no<00:05:15.530> longer<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:16.130> them

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
presses you no longer see them

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.140 
presses you no longer see them
flickering<00:05:16.880> here<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.479> there<00:05:18.849> so<00:05:19.849> obviously

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
flickering here and there so obviously

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.210 
flickering here and there so obviously
if<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.599> if<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.440> try<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:22.190> sort<00:05:22.820> of<00:05:24.220> press

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
if I if I try and sort of press

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.879 
if I if I try and sort of press
extremely<00:05:25.940> fast<00:05:26.210> that's<00:05:26.900> only<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.440> contact

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
extremely fast that's only the contact

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.779 
extremely fast that's only the contact
not<00:05:28.160> making<00:05:28.669> um<00:05:29.770> sort<00:05:30.770> of<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.039> closure<00:05:31.340> and

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
not making um sort of the closure and

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.689 
not making um sort of the closure and
it's<00:05:32.030> not<00:05:32.240> actually<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.930> button<00:05:33.889> bouncing

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
it's not actually the button bouncing

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.060 
it's not actually the button bouncing
effect<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:36.050> let's<00:05:36.380> take<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.560> look<00:05:36.740> at<00:05:36.889> the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
effect so let's take a look at the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.800 
effect so let's take a look at the
hardware<00:05:37.729> solution<00:05:38.240> that<00:05:38.360> we<00:05:38.449> can<00:05:38.599> also

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
hardware solution that we can also

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.900 
hardware solution that we can also
implement<00:05:39.289> alright<00:05:40.039> so<00:05:40.190> if<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.340> have<00:05:40.490> noticed

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
implement alright so if you have noticed

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.570 
implement alright so if you have noticed
this<00:05:41.599> is<00:05:41.750> my<00:05:41.930> current<00:05:42.169> setup<00:05:42.530> for<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.130> button

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
this is my current setup for the button

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.450 
this is my current setup for the button
so<00:05:44.419> as<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:44.720> can<00:05:44.840> see<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.650> pen<00:05:45.830> is<00:05:45.979> normally

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
so as you can see the pen is normally

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.580 
so as you can see the pen is normally
pulled<00:05:46.789> down<00:05:46.970> low<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.510> once<00:05:47.840> you<00:05:48.020> press<00:05:48.320> the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
pulled down low and once you press the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.800 
pulled down low and once you press the
button<00:05:49.039> it<00:05:49.250> goes<00:05:49.520> too<00:05:49.820> high<00:05:50.000> so<00:05:50.330> that's<00:05:50.539> what

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
button it goes too high so that's what

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.060 
button it goes too high so that's what
I'm<00:05:51.220> detecting<00:05:52.220> in<00:05:52.490> my<00:05:52.669> software<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.919> what

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
I'm detecting in my software so what

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.279 
I'm detecting in my software so what
happens<00:05:55.430> is<00:05:55.990> when<00:05:56.990> this<00:05:57.229> contact<00:05:57.680> makes

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
happens is when this contact makes

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.390 
happens is when this contact makes
basically<00:06:00.289> when<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.470> create<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:00.979> contact

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
basically when I create this contact

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.820 
basically when I create this contact
with<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.820> button<00:06:02.180> it<00:06:02.780> goes<00:06:03.050> high<00:06:03.320> low<00:06:03.560> high

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
with the button it goes high low high

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.670 
with the button it goes high low high
low<00:06:03.860> which<00:06:04.789> is<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.659> bouncing<00:06:06.169> of<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:06.380> button

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
low which is the bouncing of the button

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.200 
low which is the bouncing of the button
but<00:06:07.460> if<00:06:07.669> you<00:06:07.909> were<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.780> insert<00:06:09.260> a<00:06:10.210> capacitor

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
but if you were to insert a capacitor

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.560 
but if you were to insert a capacitor
right<00:06:11.539> here<00:06:15.430> basically<00:06:16.430> you<00:06:16.940> would<00:06:17.090> have<00:06:17.330> a

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
right here basically you would have a

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.920 
right here basically you would have a
low<00:06:18.380> on<00:06:18.770> this<00:06:19.159> capacitor<00:06:19.789> right<00:06:20.000> so<00:06:20.330> zero

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
low on this capacitor right so zero

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.820 
low on this capacitor right so zero
volts<00:06:21.349> and<00:06:21.760> when<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:23.389> press<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.870> button

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
volts and when you press the button

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.370 
volts and when you press the button
instead<00:06:25.490> of<00:06:25.610> going<00:06:25.910> up<00:06:26.030> instantly<00:06:26.750> this

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
instead of going up instantly this

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.500 
instead of going up instantly this
voltage<00:06:27.920> would<00:06:28.100> actually<00:06:28.520> take<00:06:28.760> time<00:06:29.090> to<00:06:29.390> go

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
voltage would actually take time to go

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.660 
voltage would actually take time to go
to<00:06:29.570> five<00:06:29.840> volts<00:06:30.260> depending<00:06:30.470> on<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.100> capacitor

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
to five volts depending on the capacitor

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.350 
to five volts depending on the capacitor
value<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.600> that<00:06:32.630> is<00:06:32.930> one<00:06:33.230> way<00:06:33.470> that<00:06:33.740> you<00:06:33.890> can

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
value so that is one way that you can
