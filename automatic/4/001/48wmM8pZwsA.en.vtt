hello<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.380> welcome<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.490> first<00:00:02.970> python

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hello and welcome to my first python

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.010 
hello and welcome to my first python
tutorial<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.759> this<00:00:05.759> tutorial<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.660> will<00:00:06.690> be

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
tutorial in this tutorial we will be

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.709 
tutorial in this tutorial we will be
learning<00:00:07.230> about<00:00:07.589> computer<00:00:08.429> science

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
learning about computer science

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.360 
learning about computer science
computers<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.750> general<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.500> along<00:00:11.340> with

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
computers in general and along with

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.870 
computers in general and along with
Python<00:00:12.469> getting<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.620> better<00:00:13.830> understanding<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
Python getting a better understanding of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
Python getting a better understanding of
all<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.420> three<00:00:15.780> things<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:18.650> computer

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
all of these three things so computer

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.920 
all of these three things so computer
science<00:00:20.070> computer<00:00:21.000> science<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
science computer science is not the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
science computer science is not the
study<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> computers<00:00:23.029> computers<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.480> help

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
study of computers computers just help

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.160 
study of computers computers just help
with<00:00:25.289> computer<00:00:25.500> science<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> computer

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
with computer science so computer

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
with computer science so computer
science<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:29.130> about<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.789> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
science actually about what can be

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.200 
science actually about what can be
computed<00:00:30.420> using<00:00:31.199> algorithms<00:00:31.610> and<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:35.210> we

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
computed using algorithms and so on we

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.540 
computed using algorithms and so on we
use<00:00:36.420> programming<00:00:37.170> languages<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.219> humans<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
use programming languages for humans to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
use programming languages for humans to
compute<00:00:41.550> things<00:00:41.850> instead<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> writing<00:00:42.780> in

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
compute things instead of writing in

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.639 
compute things instead of writing in
binary<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.629> programming<00:00:45.629> languages<00:00:46.020> take

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
binary and programming languages take

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.450 
binary and programming languages take
out<00:00:46.890> many<00:00:47.719> redundancies<00:00:48.719> while<00:00:49.620> doing<00:00:50.129> tasks

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
out many redundancies while doing tasks

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.910 
out many redundancies while doing tasks
on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> computer<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> help<00:00:52.350> us<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.649> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on the computer and help us out in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.790 
on the computer and help us out in
general<00:00:53.489> most<00:00:54.360> people<00:00:54.960> who<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.620> know

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
general most people who don't know

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
general most people who don't know
programming<00:00:56.460> feel<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.879> slave<00:00:59.879> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
programming feel like they are slave to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.139 
programming feel like they are slave to
their<00:01:00.629> computer<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.520> don't<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.820> much

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
their computer and don't have much

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.840 
their computer and don't have much
control<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.409> once<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.739> learn<00:01:05.010> programming

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
control but once you learn programming

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.810 
control but once you learn programming
you<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.600> full<00:01:06.869> control<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.860> computer

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you have full control over your computer

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
you have full control over your computer
and<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.659> make<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> decisions<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.220> basic

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and you make the decisions so a basic

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
and you make the decisions so a basic
overview<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:16.220> computers<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
overview of computers so we have the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.679 
overview of computers so we have the
input<00:01:18.810> such<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> mouse<00:01:20.299> microphone<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
input such as a mouse microphone or

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.980 
input such as a mouse microphone or
keyboard<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:25.130> gets<00:01:26.330> loaded<00:01:27.330> onto

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
keyboard and then that gets loaded onto

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.880 
keyboard and then that gets loaded onto
the<00:01:28.700> CPU<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.000> GPU<00:01:30.299> stands<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> central

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the CPU and GPU stands for a central

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.810 
the CPU and GPU stands for a central
processing<00:01:32.490> unit<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.290> brain<00:01:34.820> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
processing unit and that's the brain of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929 
processing unit and that's the brain of
the<00:01:36.180> computer<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> week<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the computer so this week and that is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.899 
the computer so this week and that is
all<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.380> mathematical<00:01:41.450> functions<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
all of the mathematical functions and

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
all of the mathematical functions and
logical<00:01:44.909> functions<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
logical functions which I will get to in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.679 
logical functions which I will get to in
another<00:01:48.540> tutorial<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
another tutorial so then we have the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.499 
another tutorial so then we have the
primary<00:01:54.689> memory<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.640> memory<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.060> general

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
primary memory or just memory in general

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
primary memory or just memory in general
which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> usually<00:01:59.340> called<00:01:59.610> RAM<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.680> random

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
which is usually called RAM or random

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
which is usually called RAM or random
access<00:02:01.860> memory<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.920> where<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.460> CPU

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
access memory and that is where the CPU

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.109 
access memory and that is where the CPU
draws<00:02:06.570> its<00:02:06.899> information<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
draws its information from and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.130 
draws its information from and
then<00:02:10.330> but<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.769> memory<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.569> volatile<00:02:13.569> meaning

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
then but that memory is volatile meaning

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.009 
then but that memory is volatile meaning
when<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.680> computer<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.159> turned<00:02:15.549> off<00:02:16.019> then

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
when your computer is turned off then

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.229 
when your computer is turned off then
that<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.530> gone<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:19.030> more

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
that is gone so you have to have a more

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.890 
that is gone so you have to have a more
permanent<00:02:19.599> storage<00:02:20.080> called<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.900> secondary

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
permanent storage called the secondary

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.740 
permanent storage called the secondary
storage<00:02:23.230> which<00:02:24.159> in<00:02:24.580> most<00:02:24.819> cases<00:02:25.000> called<00:02:25.540> a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
storage which in most cases called a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.680 
storage which in most cases called a
hard<00:02:25.989> disk<00:02:26.230> or<00:02:26.500> hard<00:02:26.560> drive<00:02:27.360> whichever<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
hard disk or hard drive whichever you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.949 
hard disk or hard drive whichever you
prefer<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:30.400> permanent<00:02:31.030> storage<00:02:31.360> but

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
prefer and that's permanent storage but

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.559 
prefer and that's permanent storage but
it's<00:02:32.140> slower<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.030> primary

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
it's slower so it's not the primary

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.559 
it's slower so it's not the primary
sword<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> CPU<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.670> get<00:02:36.790> information

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
sword for the CPU to get information

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.780 
sword for the CPU to get information
from<00:02:37.599> because<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> transfer<00:02:38.799> rate<00:02:38.980> isn't<00:02:39.220> as

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
from because the transfer rate isn't as

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.009 
from because the transfer rate isn't as
fast<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.549> move<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.450> output

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
fast so then we move on to the output

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.210 
fast so then we move on to the output
and<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.370> output<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.410> things<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.769> if<00:02:48.010> we

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and that's the output of things so if we

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.610 
and that's the output of things so if we
put<00:02:48.989> 1<00:02:49.989> plus<00:02:50.560> 3<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.150> add<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:53.349> would

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
put 1 plus 3 then we add for this would

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.949 
put 1 plus 3 then we add for this would
be<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.890> input<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.849> Python<00:02:55.420> will<00:02:55.599> take<00:02:55.780> care

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
be the input then Python will take care

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.199 
be the input then Python will take care
of<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.200> process<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.730> would<00:02:57.909> be<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
of the process and this would be the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.780 
of the process and this would be the
output<00:02:59.190> now<00:03:00.190> Python<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.150> general<00:03:02.159> so<00:03:03.159> python

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
output now Python in general so python

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.819 
output now Python in general so python
is<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> high-level<00:03:04.599> language<00:03:05.700> meaning<00:03:06.700> that

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
is a high-level language meaning that

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.160 
is a high-level language meaning that
the<00:03:08.829> human<00:03:09.459> reader<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:10.000> understand<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.930> end

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the human reader can understand it end

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.000 
the human reader can understand it end
the<00:03:11.980> computer<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.909> also<00:03:13.319> understand<00:03:14.319> it<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.680> a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the computer can also understand it in a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.800 
the computer can also understand it in a
sense<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:17.349> reason<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:17.919> have<00:03:18.810> programming

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
sense the reason we have programming

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.849 
sense the reason we have programming
languages<00:03:20.560> such<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.310> Python<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:22.410> C++<00:03:23.410> many

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
languages such as Python or C++ many

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.430 
languages such as Python or C++ many
high-level<00:03:24.250> languages<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.440> because

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
high-level languages is because

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.280 
high-level languages is because
computers<00:03:26.980> are<00:03:27.430> very<00:03:28.090> literal<00:03:28.859> meaning<00:03:29.859> that

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
computers are very literal meaning that

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.710 
computers are very literal meaning that
most<00:03:33.930> natural<00:03:34.930> languages<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.859> humans<00:03:36.340> use

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
most natural languages that humans use

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.479 
most natural languages that humans use
humans<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:37.900> common<00:03:38.410> knowledge<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.340> all

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
humans have common knowledge so it all

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.530 
humans have common knowledge so it all
makes<00:03:39.519> sense<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:41.260> if<00:03:42.010> you've<00:03:42.310> seen<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.879> IBM

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
makes sense so if you've seen the IBM

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.490 
makes sense so if you've seen the IBM
commercial<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.470> believe<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:46.299> shot<00:03:46.989> an<00:03:47.230> elephant

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
commercial I believe I shot an elephant

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.369 
commercial I believe I shot an elephant
in<00:03:47.980> my<00:03:48.160> pajamas<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:49.750> very<00:03:50.139> ambiguous<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.970> a

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
in my pajamas it's very ambiguous for a

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.379 
in my pajamas it's very ambiguous for a
computer<00:03:53.379> because<00:03:53.620> did<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.730> shoot<00:03:55.239> an

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
computer because did you shoot an

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.990 
computer because did you shoot an
elephant<00:03:55.599> those<00:03:56.049> in<00:03:56.349> your<00:03:56.530> pajamas<00:03:57.160> or<00:03:57.340> were

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
elephant those in your pajamas or were

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.150 
elephant those in your pajamas or were
you<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.449> your<00:03:58.629> pajamas<00:03:59.019> while<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.799> shot<00:04:00.010> the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you in your pajamas while you shot the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.420 
you in your pajamas while you shot the
elephant<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.690> Python<00:04:02.530> or<00:04:02.919> all

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
elephant and so Python or all

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.819 
elephant and so Python or all
programming<00:04:04.209> languages<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.780> general<00:04:04.829> remove

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
programming languages in general remove

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.619 
programming languages in general remove
these<00:04:06.160> ambiguities<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:08.859> are<00:04:09.629> very

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
these ambiguities and on are very

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:22.530 
these ambiguities and on are very
literal<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:12.280> if<00:04:12.639> we<00:04:13.090> say<00:04:15.000> print<00:04:16.000> sorry

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.680 

hello<00:04:23.540> world<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:25.250> means<00:04:25.580> hello<00:04:25.970> world<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
hello world this means hello world and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.469 
hello world this means hello world and
nothing<00:04:27.199> else<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:28.010> something<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:28.970> string

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
nothing else if something is a string

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.430 
nothing else if something is a string
this<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> string<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:33.080> can't<00:04:33.350> be

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
this that is a string it can't be

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.750 
this that is a string it can't be
anything<00:04:33.889> else<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.800> print<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.040> built-in

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
anything else and print is a built-in

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.980 
anything else and print is a built-in
function<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:40.310> computers<00:04:41.060> are<00:04:41.240> very<00:04:41.449> literal

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
function so computers are very literal

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.540 
function so computers are very literal
and<00:04:43.120> python<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.680> also<00:04:45.680> an<00:04:45.889> interpreted

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
and python is also an interpreted

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.340 
and python is also an interpreted
language as<00:04:47.210> opposed<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> compiled

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
language as opposed to a compiled

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.990 
language as opposed to a compiled
language<00:04:48.850> meaning<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:50.479> Python<00:04:51.440> it

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
language meaning that Python it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.879 
language meaning that Python it
literally<00:04:53.000> reads<00:04:53.419> line<00:04:53.810> for<00:04:54.169> line<00:04:54.350> of<00:04:54.680> what

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
literally reads line for line of what

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.240 
literally reads line for line of what
you<00:04:55.070> have<00:04:55.479> everything<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:59.410> that<00:05:00.410> you<00:05:00.889> have

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
you have everything that that you have

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.189 
you have everything that that you have
in<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.270> called<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.780> Python

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
in this this called the Python

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.040 
in this this called the Python
interpreter<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:05.090> where<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:05.780> can

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
interpreter this is where you can

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
interpreter this is where you can
interact<00:05:07.780> it's<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.930> programming<00:05:09.350> environment

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
interact it's a programming environment

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.779 
interact it's a programming environment
and<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.449> other<00:05:11.539> is<00:05:11.900> compiled<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.889> C++

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
and so the other is compiled like C++

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.300 
and so the other is compiled like C++
which<00:05:14.150> windows<00:05:15.080> which<00:05:15.350> I<00:05:15.560> am<00:05:15.620> currently

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
which windows which I am currently

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.430 
which windows which I am currently
running<00:05:16.550> as<00:05:16.880> my<00:05:17.090> operating<00:05:17.570> system<00:05:18.199> is

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
running as my operating system is

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.870 
running as my operating system is
written<00:05:19.250> in<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.770> program<00:05:22.280> can<00:05:22.849> be

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
written in and so the program can be

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.279 
written in and so the program can be
compiled<00:05:23.479> once<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.320> then<00:05:24.919> it<00:05:25.310> is<00:05:25.760> very<00:05:26.289> it's

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
compiled once and then it is very it's

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.820 
compiled once and then it is very it's
much<00:05:27.500> faster<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.150> games<00:05:29.630> are<00:05:30.260> compiled

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
much faster so so games are compiled

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.360 
much faster so so games are compiled
anything<00:05:31.789> you<00:05:31.910> see<00:05:32.120> with<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> dot<00:05:32.840> exe<00:05:33.169> file<00:05:33.979> is

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
anything you see with a dot exe file is

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.740 
anything you see with a dot exe file is
compiled<00:05:34.970> on<00:05:36.070> but<00:05:37.180> interpreted<00:05:38.180> languages

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
compiled on but interpreted languages

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.390 
compiled on but interpreted languages
make<00:05:39.320> for<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.889> much<00:05:40.210> more<00:05:41.210> interactive

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
make for a much more interactive

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.450 
make for a much more interactive
environment<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:43.580> is<00:05:44.090> easier<00:05:44.810> for<00:05:45.169> beginners

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
environment and is easier for beginners

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.310 
environment and is easier for beginners
because<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.849> allows<00:05:47.199> for<00:05:48.199> a<00:05:48.229> more<00:05:48.650> error<00:05:49.099> and

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
because it allows for a more error and

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.420 
because it allows for a more error and
easier<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.620> fix<00:05:51.830> mistakes<00:05:52.070> and<00:05:52.669> debug<00:05:53.599> in

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
easier to fix mistakes and debug in

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.260 
easier to fix mistakes and debug in
general<00:05:55.430> not<00:05:55.970> saying<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:57.250> c++<00:05:58.250> doesn't<00:05:59.120> have

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
general not saying that c++ doesn't have

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.260 
general not saying that c++ doesn't have
its<00:05:59.479> advantages<00:05:59.860> just<00:06:00.860> python<00:06:01.460> is<00:06:01.580> easier<00:06:02.030> for
