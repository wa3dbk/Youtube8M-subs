00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.260
 for we will try to create a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.150
 breakdown that work in deflected flexion 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.490
 this is the result we want to achieve 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 with the moment according to y the moment according to m 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 here is with a profile and so is inclined 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.460
 according to a kid angle so we're going 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.460
 start by creating a plan gantry 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.220
 here in this party plan we go 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.900
 take a bar so there we chose to 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.170
 to take a wooden bar in metal is 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:57.640
 exactly the same 75 by two 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.640
 sense so here we are going to create samba 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.540
 we will put it on we will make a bar in 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.820
 wood 5 meters long this is so 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:18.730
 show the profile and it shows up 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:24.260
 like that we will create support for him so 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.760
 so in 2d just a patella so 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.800
 the supports are well displayed 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:35.260
 we will disable here the profile is so 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.260
 we create on one side a patella forgiveness 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.620
 lojeski is displayed no it is not displayed 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.010
 on one side a simple support and on the other 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.200
 side a kneecap 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.200
 besides it does not work why 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.750
 so here is applied a patella of a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.750
 side 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:23.709
 and on the other hand we press simple 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.989
 here we are isostatic in 2d 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:32.330
 then we will create a load 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.239
 so we press again so that the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.520
 own weight is generated we are not going 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.550
 create other permanent charges for 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.760
 this simple example we will create 1.4 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.800
 load before me no and we will create a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.180
 lifting load on the whole 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:59.330
 the bar so on z search for 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 heave of little less than 0.5 kg 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:09.049
 newton of soulains in two dens 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.370
 global applied so to our number ba 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.220
 a 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.860
 Here it appears, and also in the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.000
 loading chart so now we 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:25.820
 will assign to our bar a ghana angle 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 So structure features angle 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.220
 guena and so we will put him 30 degrees 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.530
 hand corner 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.200
 then we can not enter value 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.049
 why can not we enter a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.299
 value in fact this is due to our 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.150
 starting hypothesis the structure is 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.109
 imparted coupling so to be able 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.230
 define a different angle of a multiple 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.230
 90 ° you have to create a portico in 3d 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 a space portico here it is we 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.550
 proposes to save the structure good 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.670
 we will not register it at this stage 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.950
 we should we can do it so 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.200
 so now I'm my 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.240
 structure hypothesis it's gone well 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.769
 social to operate and we will come back on 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.760
 kid english here we have news 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.620
 values ​​that appear in the menu 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.710
 drop down so definition 30 degrees on 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.330
 go to better see it we'll show a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.950
 time the local landmark and also the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.340
 sketch of the profile and so that's thirty 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.900
 degrees we will apply our part a 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:45.020
 Applied here is waiting for the kid 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:49.020
 which is displayed we will launch with calculation 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.210
 if I have not forgotten anything about instability 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.860
 type 2 rotating around x is 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.190
 always in the hands of around them is 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.670
 in next rotation then displayed the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.610
 number 2 do not disable the structure so 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.480
 it's here so actually like us 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.710
 went into 3d structure the 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.690
 assumptions about the supports have to be 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.160
 reviews so that the whole remains 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.300
 isostatic there is instability 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.990
 remember that the assumptions are too many 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.640
 degrees of freedom on the supports so we 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.640
 will go to our office support 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:34.780
 I will ask the display of me 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.010
 show the codes of the supports to see 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.400
 what is small what is 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.570
 is free here so we see here then 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.300
 I disable the supports there are free 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.450
 ali bach blocked free free free so 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.450
 there we have a lot of freedom is there so 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:58.180
 we have a recoil we put a ball joint 2d 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:02.530
 so the three rotations are free on 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:06.010
 will already start by blocking the rotation 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.530
 in the axis of the project the rotation which 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.530
 twist so we will create a new support 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.140
 we will call 3d patella 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.770
 and we block the rotation around x 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:39.630
 here you go stay alain so in tulle 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.630
 3d apply to number 2 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.030
 if not in broad strokes the sea goes 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.990
 apply that will make the results 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.990
 void 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.550
 obviously so that's the code of support 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:00.700
 exchange 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:07.240
 and here we will put for a kneecap 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:09.410
 will also put in the hall 3d here is 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.180
 so normally there will be more 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.720
 errors when we start calculating 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:18.190
 here are more errors so no no 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.190
 we can go to the results 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.919
 and if we ask 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.270
 so the next moments xc the world 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.699
 sleep on he could not have known everything there 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:38.440
 are neutral that's not what we 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:42.849
 interest we will show the moment alone 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.530
 we see it there and the next moment z 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:50.680
 so here they are not in the best 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:53.440
 in the same plane obviously now 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.180
 that modeling is complete and that 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.009
 the solicitations are calculated 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.740
 will see in the next episode how 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:01.740
 dimensioned this failure in deflected flexion
