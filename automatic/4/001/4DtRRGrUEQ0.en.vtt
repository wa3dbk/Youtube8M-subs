00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

for<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:00.870> past<00:00:01.020> like<00:00:01.170> three<00:00:01.709> days<00:00:01.979> or<00:00:02.190> so<00:00:02.370> I've

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
for the past like three days or so I've

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.030 
for the past like three days or so I've
been<00:00:02.580> kinda<00:00:03.060> sick<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.710> that's<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.830> reason

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
been kinda sick and that's the reason

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.589 
been kinda sick and that's the reason
why<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.850> didn't<00:00:06.359> do<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:08.069> trailer<00:00:08.490> reaction<00:00:08.730> you

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
why I didn't do the trailer reaction you

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.950 
why I didn't do the trailer reaction you
know<00:00:09.630> when<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.440> trailer<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:11.010> came<00:00:11.550> out

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
know when the trailer actually came out

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.269 
know when the trailer actually came out
I<00:00:13.460> actually<00:00:14.460> planned<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.570> not<00:00:15.599> doing<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
I actually planned on not doing this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.840 
I actually planned on not doing this
this<00:00:18.060> particular<00:00:18.350> reaction<00:00:19.350> since<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.310> mean

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
this particular reaction since I mean

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.890 
this particular reaction since I mean
I've<00:00:20.939> already<00:00:21.150> done<00:00:21.859> three<00:00:22.859> trailers<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:23.970> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I've already done three trailers now of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.400 
I've already done three trailers now of
spider-man<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> thought<00:00:27.410> it's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
spider-man and so I thought it's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.830 
spider-man and so I thought it's
probably<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.099> more<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> same

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
probably going to be more of the same

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610 
probably going to be more of the same
but<00:00:30.840> i<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.730> beginning<00:00:33.620> comments

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
but i have actually beginning comments

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.910 
but i have actually beginning comments
which<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.790> strange<00:00:36.510> feeling<00:00:36.899> telling<00:00:37.770> me

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
which is a strange feeling telling me

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
which is a strange feeling telling me
that<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:38.129> should<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> reaction<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that i should actually do a reaction and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.639 
that i should actually do a reaction and
that<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.370> why<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.940> gonna<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.379> i'm

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that is so why I'm gonna do that but i'm

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
that is so why I'm gonna do that but i'm
just<00:00:44.010> warning<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.110> trailer<00:00:46.500> is
