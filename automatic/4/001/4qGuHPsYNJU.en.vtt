Hi, I'm here in the middle of London's Borough
Market on Super Saturday of the Olympics with

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.210
YouTube's famous Katie Puckrik.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.290
Well, famous if you love perfume.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.110
I also do a little TV hosting, I do a little
writing, and I do a lot of eating, which is

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.340
why we're here.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.050
Why we chose this market.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.789
Borough Market is amazing, Amanda.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.470
It's been here in some way, shape or form
for at least 1,000 years.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.470
Wow.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.470
You're gonna take us on a food tour.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.340
We're gonna go on a food tour, and the thing
that I find whenever I come to Borough Market

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.680
is, it's hard to really know how to pace yourself.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.370
You know, you gotta stay flexible.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.399
You can't just think: Um, okay, I'm gonna
start with an appetizer, I'm gonna have the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.399
main course, I'm gonna have dessert.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.830
Because you might see desert first.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.350
It's just a tower of joy.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.151
Talk about anything made with love is healthy,
I'm sure fudge is the healthiest, because

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.649
it's made with so much love.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.759
Made with love.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.870
Where are we?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.430
This is one of my favorite coffee places in
London, Amanda.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.580
It's called Monmouth Coffee, and it is classic
British coffee.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.130
Outstanding caffienation situation.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.670
It really is.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
Cheers.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
Cheers.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.540
Do they have flat whites in American?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Because thats…

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.790
When you said flat whites here, I did not
know what that meant.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.860
What is a flat white?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.750
It's kind of a cross between a macchiato and
a cappuccino, but it's just a slightly creamery

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.351
foam -- the foam is more dense.

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.351
Dense foam.

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:33.351
Yeah.

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.440
So it's a cross between a latte and a cappuccino?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.229
Well, but it's not as milky as a latte.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.650
So that's why I say it's more like a macchiato.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.570
You know, it's like coffee math.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.079
When you come to London, you mostly always
here about Portobello Market.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.079
Yeah.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.940
Well, Portobello Market is more like antiques,
vintage clothes and record shops -- that kind

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940
of thing.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
Yes.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.940
So Borough Market is all about the food.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.159
You can have your Pimm's, you can have your
alcohol, you can have your locally sourced

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.840
food, various meets and various vegetables.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.979
And then there's olden days London Suffolk
Cathedral.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.290
And there's always this kind of electricity
in Borough Market -- because, you know, it's

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.290
food.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.041
And people just get passionate, excited and
overheated.

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:19.041
When you walk into the the cheese market there's
like hundreds of cheeses everywhere.

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:24.080
How do you go about picking -- what did we
end up with?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.819
Well, we ended up with something called Ragstone
goat's cheese.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.730
This is like desert and dinner mixed together,
because it's savory, and it's also so creamy.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.730
Maybe a hit of wine and cheese.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.730
Yeah, do you have some wine?

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670
Do we have some wine?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.349
We are here at the final stop of the day:
The pub.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.690
Actually, for many British people, it's the
first stop of the day.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.690
Well…

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.420
So we don't really need to stand on ceremony
and pretend like it's the last thing we're

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.840
gonna be doing.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.380
Katie, thank you so much.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.930

or fumehead.com.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.900
Alright, let's go play time.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
Cheers.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.901
Cheers.
