00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:06.360
 how do you know what makes the fuel in your car turn into motion 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.970
 if the answer is no 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.690
 Do not worry, it's very common not to know how the system works in this case. 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 the actor makes the energy produced by the combustion compete for energy 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.679
 mechanics so the wheels start some movement this code 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:24.819
 the conference 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.130
 in four times 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.220
 you're going to have a time layoff mikito unit of the mix 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.310
 the compression time of this mixture is compressed 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.110
 reaching the heating temperature approximately 800 degrees 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.530
 in the third time to exposure time 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.740
 My heart is alert. 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 this spark that generated 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 has the capacity to generate 40 thousand 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 if it is enough 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.310
 will enter 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.050
 on Wednesday 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 exhaust 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 this time 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 the three wounded 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 went to sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.829
 the atmosphere as a whole can be divided into parts chips 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:19.710
 properties 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.049
 the pizzas are those that come into motion when the author starts to 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.890
 to function 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.800
 how to pack the card 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.070
 and the head 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.610
 if the parts of this movement are trees and cranks 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.610
 pakistan to bial and the command of valves 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.409
 as now undoubtedly the most important organ if the car 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.899
 and it also how it works for it 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.960
 to access some essential aspects 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.230
 to be a good performer 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.240
 for the shelf life is going to have system is within the standard 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.000
 of perfect maintenance 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.710
 requires preventive maintenance 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 preventive maintenance that depends on assemblers in the assembler 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.220
 respecting the review deadlines 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.830
 if you have an eye 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.249
 you trade within a standard 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.349
 of a physical limit 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.669
 you will have a higher risk durability 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.160
 when this maintenance is done correctly 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.549
 many flaws that can happen in the chest 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.639
 at a time like this knowing how to identify the problem is essential 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:31.359
 then the best thing to do is to look for the 'trustworthy workshop' 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.189
 service all this 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.589
 allows 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.590
 I can have a perfect body condition 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.789
 conservation of 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.509
 both idle 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.589
 old house and here
