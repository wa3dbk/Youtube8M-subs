00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
looked a lot like the only other blind

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450

bags<00:00:36.600> only<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.440> say<00:00:37.620> series<00:00:37.950> 2<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.280> here

an<00:05:30.450> underwater<00:05:30.840> dog<00:05:31.260> for<00:05:31.590> Ariel<00:05:31.979> I<00:05:32.220> guess<00:05:32.700> is

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
an underwater dog for Ariel I guess is

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.340 
an underwater dog for Ariel I guess is
that<00:05:33.000> their<00:05:33.120> Ariel<00:05:33.450> becomes<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.810> princess<00:05:34.020> and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
that their Ariel becomes a princess and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.230 
that their Ariel becomes a princess and
she<00:05:34.500> has<00:05:34.590> legs<00:05:34.830> though<00:05:35.039> because<00:05:35.310> dogs<00:05:35.880> can't

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
she has legs though because dogs can't

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.120 
she has legs though because dogs can't
