00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.470
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 cook delicious yogurt in a slow cooker 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.790
 usually for making a cake 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.140
 Now use such containers are 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 any multicooker here maximum 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 fits up to a liter of milk as it were in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 eventually I was there more than a liter of the product is not the same I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.670
 I use another bowl exactly that bowl 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.549
 which is in the slow cooker 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:01.489
 we will make a yurt on 2 liters poured 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.489
 the tank i use is homemade milk and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 how would you need it before using any 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:19.159
 case of boil the wobbler vanilla on 2 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.310
 liters I take two sachets 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.159
 This, too, as if for an amateur can be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.159
 you even have three sachets of sugar 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.969
 the edge of the house is six spoons of plain sugar 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.709
 stir well and put your foot in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.049
 time of how our milk time we 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.319
 stir to make sugar better 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.319
 dissolved and did not stick like a pot 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.380
 keep a close eye on the milk while stirring 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.420
 at the first sign of boiling right away 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 turn off our task as if only 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.060
 bring to a boil where everyone will die 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.870
 not needed on bacteria and in order to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.319
 good milk steamed out 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.269
 vanilla plain sugar as soon as our 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:59.530

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 stirring off the gas and give it to him 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.319
 cool to room temperature like me 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.670
 said earlier if it is milk 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.739
 Homemade something must be in any 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.459

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.360
 usually but still boiled in the factory 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.550

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.730
 she's sugar dissolved and when added 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.260
 bacteria an important point so that bacteria and 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.410
 milk had 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.580
 and lonely temperature is desirable 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.450
 Of course room as a sourdough we 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.960
 we will use such a product 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.210
 here it is calculated to 3 liters of milk 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.690

 six hours later our yogurt 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:10.560
 the emptiness of yogurt depends on the amount 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.990
 bacteria that we added milk 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.200
