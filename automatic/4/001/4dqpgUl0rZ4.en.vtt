hydropneumatic suspension which you
manually<00:01:01.170> adjust<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.820> even<00:01:03.180> though

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

an hour

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.690 
an hour
you<00:01:07.229> hardly<00:01:07.500> feel<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> thing

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.080 

and<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.360> also<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.900> monster<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.070> machine<00:01:19.189> when

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
and is also a monster of a machine when

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.109 
and is also a monster of a machine when
it<00:01:20.360> comes<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.960> acceleration<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.310> what<00:01:22.880> a

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
it comes to acceleration this is what a

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.560 
it comes to acceleration this is what a
straight<00:01:23.570> 4-cylinder<00:01:24.700> 235<00:01:25.700> brake<00:01:26.090> horsepower

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.830 
straight 4-cylinder 235 brake horsepower
engine<00:01:27.080> sounds<00:01:27.680> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.210 

and<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.960> also<00:01:35.080> does<00:01:35.500> naught<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.010> 100

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and it also does naught to 100

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.350 
and it also does naught to 100
kilometers<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.540> 7.5<00:01:38.230> seconds<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.180> later

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
kilometers in 7.5 seconds see you later

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.679 
kilometers in 7.5 seconds see you later

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
racing the new C 350 e is also a top

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.490 
racing the new C 350 e is also a top
performer<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.299> has<00:01:58.479> managed<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.929> combine<00:01:59.110> all

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
of that with being super efficient it

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.289 
of that with being super efficient it
even<00:02:02.470> has<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.710> enhanced<00:02:03.310> comfort<00:02:03.700> feature<00:02:03.939> of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
AIRMATIC air suspension as standard so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.120 
AIRMATIC air suspension as standard so
I'm<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.960> see<00:02:08.170> what<00:02:08.349> all<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.709> promise

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
I'm going to see what all this promise

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.500 
I'm going to see what all this promise
actually<00:02:09.970> feels<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.360> off<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.380> go

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.509 

now<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.349> think<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.739> hybrid<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.310> first

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
now when you think of a hybrid the first

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.130 
now when you think of a hybrid the first
thing<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> think<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.540> course<00:02:19.750> fuel

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
thing you think about is of course fuel

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.070 
thing you think about is of course fuel
efficiency<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.790> C<00:02:21.940> 350<00:02:22.420> e<00:02:22.450> has<00:02:22.870> got

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
efficiency and the C 350 e has got

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.619 
efficiency and the C 350 e has got
certified<00:02:23.709> figures<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> only<00:02:24.459> using<00:02:25.030> 2.1

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
certified figures of only using 2.1

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.720 
certified figures of only using 2.1
liters<00:02:25.659> of<00:02:26.230> fuel<00:02:26.440> per<00:02:26.530> hundred<00:02:27.310> kilometers

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
liters of fuel per hundred kilometers

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.300 
liters of fuel per hundred kilometers
and<00:02:28.090> when<00:02:28.659> it's<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:28.989> full<00:02:29.379> electric<00:02:29.830> mode<00:02:29.860> can

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
and when it's in full electric mode can

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
and when it's in full electric mode can
achieve<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.269> 31<00:02:31.840> kilometers<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.500> distance

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
achieve up to 31 kilometers in distance

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.610 
achieve up to 31 kilometers in distance
but<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.629> like<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> wolf<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.260> sheep's<00:02:35.500> clothing

that's awesome so the four-cylinder
engine<00:02:49.599> combined<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.349> electric<00:02:50.769> motor<00:02:51.010> give

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
engine combined the electric motor give

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.210 
engine combined the electric motor give
this<00:02:51.489> car<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.819> total<00:02:52.450> power<00:02:52.599> output<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:53.220> 279
