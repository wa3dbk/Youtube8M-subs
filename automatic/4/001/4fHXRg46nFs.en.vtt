00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a bit of a concern but I'm not sure that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
a bit of a concern but I'm not sure that
the<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.640> necessarily<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:24.929> were

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the the necessarily and all of them were

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.300 
the the necessarily and all of them were
penalties<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.769> might<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> disagreement

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
penalties we might have a disagreement

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
penalties we might have a disagreement
on<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> first

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
on well let's have a look at the first

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
on well let's have a look at the first
scrum<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.679> game<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.970> penalty<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
scrum of the game and the penalty is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
scrum of the game and the penalty is
actually<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> far<00:00:30.960> side<00:00:31.259> it's<00:00:31.500> Tom

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
actually on the far side it's Tom

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
actually on the far side it's Tom
Francis<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.940> side

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
Francis on this side

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.229 
Francis on this side
Corbett<00:00:34.140> Hierro<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.670> both<00:00:35.879> come<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
Corbett Hierro and they both come in

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.970 
Corbett Hierro and they both come in
together<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.629> actually<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> gap<00:00:37.530> opens

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
together I actually think the gap opens

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
together I actually think the gap opens
up<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.340> bit<00:00:38.610> you're<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.390> sure<00:00:39.420> well

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
up a little bit you're not so sure well

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
up a little bit you're not so sure well
no<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.379> Exeter<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> look<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.579> their

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
no I think Exeter that you look at their

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
no I think Exeter that you look at their
feet<00:00:41.969> their<00:00:42.180> feet<00:00:42.390> stay<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> ground<00:00:43.079> they

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
feet their feet stay in the ground they

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020 
feet their feet stay in the ground they
wait<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.829> squeeze<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
wait they squeeze and I think it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
wait they squeeze and I think it's
Northampton<00:00:45.660> who<00:00:45.750> give<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.680> okay

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
Northampton who give up first right okay

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
Northampton who give up first right okay
and<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.640> actually<00:00:48.360> core<00:00:48.780> Becerra<00:00:49.079> got<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and then actually core Becerra got the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
and then actually core Becerra got the
penalty<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> next<00:00:51.000> scrum<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.780> third

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
penalty at the next scrum the third

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.260 
penalty at the next scrum the third
scrum<00:00:52.410> again<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> penalty<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.730> time<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
scrum again a penalty this time it's on

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
scrum again a penalty this time it's on
this<00:00:54.390> side<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.780> loose<00:00:54.960> head<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.649> Exeter

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
this side the loose head side for Exeter

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
this side the loose head side for Exeter
penalty<00:00:56.789> goes<00:00:57.149> against<00:00:57.690> Denman<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> tight

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
penalty goes against Denman the tight

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.619 
penalty goes against Denman the tight
Hedford<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.160> Northampton<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Hedford for Northampton but it's all to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
Hedford for Northampton but it's all to
do<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.960> elbow<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.649> roll<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> on

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
do with this elbow if we just roll it on

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
do with this elbow if we just roll it on
let's<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.690> happens

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
let's have a little look what happens

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.040 
let's have a little look what happens
one<00:01:05.010> tug<00:01:05.310> there<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.940> then<00:01:06.120> ball<00:01:06.300> comes<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
one tug there and then ball comes in and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.320 
one tug there and then ball comes in and
the<00:01:07.890> secondary<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> tight<00:01:08.730> and<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:08.970> think

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the secondary the tight and I think

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.790 
the secondary the tight and I think
that's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.960> harsh<00:01:10.200> penalty<00:01:10.620> against

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
that's a really harsh penalty against

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500 
that's a really harsh penalty against
North<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.280> very<00:01:11.850> harsh<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> only

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
North on it's very very harsh the only

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.150 
North on it's very very harsh the only
thing<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.440> linesman<00:01:13.890> sort

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
thing I can think is the linesman sort

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.770 
thing I can think is the linesman sort
of<00:01:14.220> said<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> Northampton's<00:01:15.210> released<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of said that Northampton's released is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
of said that Northampton's released is
buying<00:01:16.020> first<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.620> are<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:16.860> harsh<00:01:17.130> okay

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
buying first but are that's harsh okay

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.800 
buying first but are that's harsh okay
let's<00:01:17.760> go<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.120> quick<00:01:18.300> look<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.600> those

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
let's go and have a quick look at those

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.710

is<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> Exeter<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.940> they<00:01:36.060> keep

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
is that Exeter don't give up they keep

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
is that Exeter don't give up they keep
squeezing<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> Ben<00:01:37.050> Moon<00:01:37.320> does<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> fantastic

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
squeezing and Ben Moon does a fantastic

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
squeezing and Ben Moon does a fantastic
job<00:01:38.370> so<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:38.940> happens<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.510> corbs<00:01:39.870> Corbis

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
job so what happens is corbs Corbis

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
job so what happens is corbs Corbis
arrow<00:01:40.650> steps<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.490> try<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.730> attack<00:01:42.150> him

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
arrow steps out to try and attack him

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
arrow steps out to try and attack him
and<00:01:42.540> Exeter<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.350> keep<00:01:43.590> walking<00:01:44.100> through<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and Exeter just keep walking through and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
and Exeter just keep walking through and
it<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.000> relies<00:01:45.330> on<00:01:45.390> Ben<00:01:45.780> Moon<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.290> forward

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it all relies on Ben Moon going forward

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
it all relies on Ben Moon going forward
and<00:01:46.950> creating<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.550> three<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.910> two

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and creating a three on two

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.000 
and creating a three on two
and<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:49.050> an<00:01:49.140> area<00:01:49.440> if<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.770> back

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
and it's actually an area if we go back

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.770 
and it's actually an area if we go back
slightly<00:01:50.610> guys<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.060> an<00:01:51.150> area<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> they

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
slightly guys it's an area that they

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
slightly guys it's an area that they
struggled<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.220> game<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.970> sometimes

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
struggled with all game and sometimes

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.790 
struggled with all game and sometimes
once<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> referee<00:01:55.080> gets<00:01:55.290> something<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.620> your

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
once the referee gets something in your

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.860 
once the referee gets something in your
mind<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.430> even<00:01:56.850> from<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.270> north<00:01:57.420> ancestors

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
mind and even from the north ancestors

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.060 
mind and even from the north ancestors
perspective<00:01:58.440> they're<00:01:58.620> a<00:01:58.650> bit<00:01:58.860> cautious

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
perspective they're a bit cautious

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.680 
perspective they're a bit cautious
because<00:01:59.460> they're<00:01:59.670> they're<00:02:00.150> thinking<00:02:00.480> well<00:02:00.600> we

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
because they're they're thinking well we

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.880 
because they're they're thinking well we
don't<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.140> pinged<00:02:01.410> for<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
don't want to get pinged for this and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.110 
don't want to get pinged for this and
you<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.460> things<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.850> wouldn't

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
you do you do things that you wouldn't

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.940 
you do you do things that you wouldn't
normally<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.200> wondered<00:02:04.800> whether

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
normally do but I just wondered whether

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.250 
normally do but I just wondered whether
that<00:02:05.490> gap<00:02:05.790> opened<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:07.020> guy

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
that gap opened up because if that guy

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.249 
that gap opened up because if that guy
opens<00:02:07.980> up<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.399> Francis<00:02:09.149> goes<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.630> he<00:02:09.930> can't

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
opens up and Francis goes in he can't

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
opens up and Francis goes in he can't
stay<00:02:10.560> square<00:02:10.890> cut<00:02:11.160> otherwise<00:02:11.700> he's<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
stay square cut otherwise he's going to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.340 
stay square cut otherwise he's going to
get<00:02:12.360> shunted<00:02:12.570> out<00:02:12.810> let's<00:02:13.170> go

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
get shunted out let's go

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410 
get shunted out let's go
to<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> other<00:02:13.770> side<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.460> have<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.270> look

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
to the other side and have a little look

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.350 
to the other side and have a little look
at<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.930> are<00:02:15.960> agreeing<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.150> which<00:02:18.150> is

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
at the one we are agreeing on which is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.320 
at the one we are agreeing on which is
this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.320> Denman<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.190> we've<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:20.880> moon

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
this is Denman here and we've got moon

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.660 
this is Denman here and we've got moon
here<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> pine<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:23.130> me<00:02:23.400> as

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
here so you can see the pine there me as

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.950 
here so you can see the pine there me as
he<00:02:23.760> talked<00:02:23.910> us<00:02:24.030> through<00:02:24.060> yeah<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.810> basically

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
he talked us through yeah so basically

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810 
he talked us through yeah so basically
he's<00:02:25.230> got<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.380> very<00:02:25.680> strong<00:02:26.010> bind<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.610> looks

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
he's got a very strong bind it looks

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.950 
he's got a very strong bind it looks
like<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.180> should<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.420> had<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.600> further

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
like you should have had it further

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.780 
like you should have had it further
which<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.260> why<00:02:28.560> he<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.770> able<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.250> roll<00:02:29.460> him<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
which is why he was able to roll him in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.480 
which is why he was able to roll him in
but<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> maybe<00:02:31.250> demin<00:02:32.250> at<00:02:32.370> his

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
but I do think that maybe demin at his

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.430 
but I do think that maybe demin at his
legs<00:02:32.730> too<00:02:32.970> far<00:02:33.210> back<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.260> their

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
legs too far back so you can see their

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.570 
legs too far back so you can see their
moon<00:02:34.620> almost<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:35.070> legs<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.340> little<00:02:35.430> bit

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
moon almost your legs a little bit

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.190 
moon almost your legs a little bit
further<00:02:35.820> back<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.300> can<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.600> been<00:02:36.930> moving

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
further back so we can see been moving

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.410 
further back so we can see been moving
inside<00:02:37.500> want<00:02:37.710> Bend<00:02:38.160> moon<00:02:38.340> tugs<00:02:38.640> once<00:02:38.970> twice

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
inside want Bend moon tugs once twice

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.090 
inside want Bend moon tugs once twice
and<00:02:39.690> because<00:02:39.900> he's<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.260> wide<00:02:40.500> he's<00:02:40.770> able<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
and because he's so wide he's able to

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.030 
and because he's so wide he's able to
just<00:02:41.370> almost<00:02:41.520> pull<00:02:42.000> him<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.620> his<00:02:43.620> legs<00:02:43.890> are<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
just almost pull him on his legs are a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.350 
just almost pull him on his legs are a
long<00:02:44.190> way<00:02:44.310> back<00:02:44.490> it's<00:02:44.700> almost<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.150> taking

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
long way back it's almost like taking

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600 
long way back it's almost like taking
the<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.840> rug<00:02:46.020> away<00:02:46.230> isn't<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.590> ok<00:02:46.950> let's<00:02:47.460> go

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
the the rug away isn't it ok let's go

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
the the rug away isn't it ok let's go
and<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.820> look<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.570> later<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> game

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and have a look at later on in the game

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440 
and have a look at later on in the game
now<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.580> approach<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.090> scrum

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
now as we approach this scrum

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
now as we approach this scrum
Northampton<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.350> real<00:02:52.620> problems<00:02:53.040> they've

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
the very next scrum was a yellow card

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.740 
the very next scrum was a yellow card
because<00:03:56.190> they'd<00:03:56.340> replaced<00:03:56.760> Kaba<00:03:57.270> Sierra<00:03:57.540> with

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
because they'd replaced Kaba Sierra with

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.530 
because they'd replaced Kaba Sierra with
Alex<00:03:58.020> Walla<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.470> he<00:03:59.430> wheeled<00:03:59.700> out<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.300> got

Alex Walla and he wheeled out and got

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.760 
Alex Walla and he wheeled out and got
yellow<00:04:00.750> card<00:04:00.990> what's<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> difference<00:04:01.650> why

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
yellow card what's the difference why

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.140 
yellow card what's the difference why
would<00:04:01.980> he<00:04:02.100> have<00:04:02.190> been<00:04:02.340> given<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> yellow<00:04:02.790> card

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
would he have been given a yellow card

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.120 
would he have been given a yellow card
against<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> penalty<00:04:04.260> try<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.650> think<00:04:04.740> because

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
against the penalty try I think because

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.130 
against the penalty try I think because
the<00:04:05.250> referee<00:04:05.760> was<00:04:05.880> by<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.420> point<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:06.840> wants

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the referee was by this point just wants

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.420 
the referee was by this point just wants
