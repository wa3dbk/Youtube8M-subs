00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the duisburg zoo is one of 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.549
 Germany 2 in which still the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 many live the second in Nuremberg 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.880
 the dolphin entertainment in Zolli's 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 However, heavily debated and that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 not only because of the delfin shows but 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 also criticized because of the small basin 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.080
 So is the attitude of the animals 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 The Bundestag must be back now 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.859
 to submit an application of the green 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.650
 they want the malfunction in the zoo 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 finally ban it is that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.000
 heraldic animals of duisburg zoos are her 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.410
 proud of their dolphins and convinced 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 that the animals are well 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.880
 Of course, be any 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 livestock farming is always just a compromise 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 that is a tactically fine 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.890
 whoever does not tilt in front of me 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.469
 or other animal species too, it is one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 must reach a compromise if we 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.700
 finally want to fulfill our tasks 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.950
 to do on the nature in conclusion by 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 direct conservation soffin so the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.920
 delfinschützer jürgen ortmüller like 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.780
 do not accept this argument 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 certainly not for the typical too 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 dolphins the so-called big five 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.649
 So big thin against bosch in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 washington found protection agreement 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.909
 are not threatened with extinction 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.439
 That's why it's from elementary school 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.930
 no sense at all because many breed 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.299
 because that's still enough money to live on 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 here in nature up to 50 kilometers 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.799
 The sea mammals are fast every hour 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.020
 if there is enough space according to law 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.360
 need to dolphinaria for five animals only 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 a size of about 40 times ten meters 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.049
 have and be four meters deep 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509
 dolphins dive in the wild 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.400
 but up to 300 meters deep 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.450
 go straight for at least a minute 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 to swim 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.280
 The animals have a 900-meter-long basin 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 measured by natural radius of movement 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.040
 is the bedding almost vanishing 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.110
 small 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.729
 With the ban on refineries, that would be 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 problem, however, not yet solved 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.380
 because you can just go back to the sea 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 the zone many not so the fina 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 the natural hunt for food 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.110
 unlearned and it really was 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 required that people cared 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 be set up by the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.930
 the dolphins own the animals 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 at least one worthy gravy bread 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
 they also do not get trained 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.680
 can be virtually supported living in the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.540
 open sea that is expensive and therefore 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.390
 is not realistic more likely 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.729
 that here 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.170
 the animals from the recently decided 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.760
 Münster delicacy are in a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.440
 zoo landed in holland 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 jürgen ortmüller injuries 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.400
 evidently documents struggling 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.500
 between , however, they would have a law 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.280
 So also specify where the dolphins 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.590
 find accommodation 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.510
 Animal rights activists but expect that the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.350
 Federal Government's application of the green 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.350
 bears
