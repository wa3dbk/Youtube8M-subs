00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.690 
frame we have built this machine for one
of<00:00:18.820> our<00:00:18.939> customer<00:00:19.509> in<00:00:19.630> Saudi<00:00:19.869> Arabia<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.550> is

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
of our customer in Saudi Arabia this is

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.279 
of our customer in Saudi Arabia this is
a<00:00:21.730> simple<00:00:22.090> introduction<00:00:22.419> at<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.840> moment<00:00:23.140> this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
a simple introduction at the moment this

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.990 
a simple introduction at the moment this
octa<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.890> set<00:00:24.189> in<00:00:24.400> i8<00:00:25.109> configuration<00:00:26.109> so<00:00:27.039> if<00:00:27.640> we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
octa is set in i8 configuration so if we

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.369 
octa is set in i8 configuration so if we
look<00:00:28.390> at<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.689> from<00:00:28.900> behind<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.689> yellow<00:00:31.990> strips

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
look at it from behind the yellow strips

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.510 
look at it from behind the yellow strips
are<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.980> forward<00:00:33.370> section<00:00:33.519> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.510 

that<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.970> quad<00:00:39.540> configurations<00:00:40.320> surplus<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that is quad configurations surplus and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.370 
that is quad configurations surplus and
quad<00:00:41.730> configurations<00:00:42.420> together<00:00:42.750> make<00:00:43.170> an

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
quad configurations together make an

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.800 
quad configurations together make an
octa<00:00:44.220> why<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> call<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.060> plus<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.660> quad

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
octa why I call it plus and quad

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.390 
octa why I call it plus and quad
configuration<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:46.950> easy<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
configuration because it's very easy to

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.970 
configuration because it's very easy to
understand<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> mount<00:00:49.260> props<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:49.800> which

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
understand how to mount props and which

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.890 
understand how to mount props and which
way<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.190> motors<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.670> spinning<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
way the motors are spinning so if you

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100 
way the motors are spinning so if you
look<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.380> cross<00:00:52.730> that's<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.390> three

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
look at the cross that's your one three

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.760 
look at the cross that's your one three
five<00:00:55.590> seven<00:00:56.300> okay<00:00:57.330> those<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.350> three

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
five seven okay those are your one three

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
five seven okay those are your one three
five<00:00:59.070> seven<00:00:59.129> motors<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.120> ESS<00:01:00.540> so<00:01:01.080> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.800> cross

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
five seven motors or ESS so in the cross

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.540 
five seven motors or ESS so in the cross
they<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.580> spin<00:01:02.910> counterclockwise<00:01:04.190> okay<00:01:05.190> all

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
they will spin counterclockwise okay all

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.010 
they will spin counterclockwise okay all
will<00:01:06.479> spin<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> counterclockwise<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.340> X

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
will spin in counterclockwise and in X

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
will spin in counterclockwise and in X
they<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.170> spin<00:01:10.470> clockwise<00:01:10.740> because<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.580> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
they will spin clockwise because this is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
they will spin clockwise because this is
2<00:01:12.000> 4<00:01:12.479> 6<00:01:12.930> 8<00:01:13.170> 2<00:01:13.920> 4<00:01:14.310> 6<00:01:14.700> 8<00:01:14.940> they<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> spin<00:01:16.050> clockwise

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
2 4 6 8 2 4 6 8 they will spin clockwise

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
2 4 6 8 2 4 6 8 they will spin clockwise
so<00:01:16.920> cross<00:01:17.490> counterclockwise<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.660> X<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so cross counterclockwise and X is

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.650 
so cross counterclockwise and X is
clockwise<00:01:19.979> spinning<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.910> easy<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.420> remember

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
clockwise spinning very easy to remember

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.870 
clockwise spinning very easy to remember
and<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:22.440> easy<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.830> set<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.340> eye<00:01:23.369> 8

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and very easy to set up the eye 8

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.840 
and very easy to set up the eye 8
configuration

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.620 

now<00:01:30.070> even<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.220> kid<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:31.520> assemble<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.360> frame

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
now even a kid can assemble this frame

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.540 
now even a kid can assemble this frame
because<00:01:33.200> most<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:33.740> parts<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:34.250> come

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
because most of the parts just come

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.520 
because most of the parts just come
assembled<00:01:35.000> all<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:35.600> need<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.870> do<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.170> put<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
assembled all you need to do is put the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.810 
assembled all you need to do is put the
arms<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.400> set<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.120> landing<00:01:38.540> gear<00:01:38.690> on<00:01:38.720> it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
arms in and set the landing gear on it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.460 
arms in and set the landing gear on it
folding<00:01:40.820> mechanism<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.630> easy<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.140> set

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
folding mechanism is really easy to set

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.540 
folding mechanism is really easy to set
basically<00:01:43.460> if<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:44.060> see<00:01:44.300> here<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.950> piece<00:01:46.280> is

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
basically if you see here this piece is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.060 
basically if you see here this piece is
actually<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:51.050> piece<00:01:51.290> is<00:01:51.410> actually<00:01:51.530> fixed

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
actually this piece is actually fixed

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.710 
actually this piece is actually fixed
right<00:01:52.190> now<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.729> cannot<00:01:52.970> move<00:01:53.210> because<00:01:53.540> there's

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
right now it cannot move because there's

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.170 
right now it cannot move because there's
a<00:01:53.780> screw<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.259> here<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.100> lock<00:01:55.310> nut<00:01:55.550> but<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.060> you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
a screw in here the lock nut but if you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.660 
a screw in here the lock nut but if you
remove<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.660> screw<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.680> whole<00:01:57.950> arm<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.520> a

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
remove this screw this whole arm of a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.870 
remove this screw this whole arm of a
fall<00:01:59.000> down<00:01:59.509> so<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.020> will<00:02:00.140> fold<00:02:00.530> down<00:02:00.979> okay

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
fall down so it will fold down okay

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.370 
fall down so it will fold down okay
so<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.390> very<00:02:02.539> very<00:02:02.630> easy<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.140> piece

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so this is very very easy this piece

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740 
so this is very very easy this piece
here<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.830> actually<00:02:04.580> simply<00:02:05.149> holding<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.570> here

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
here is actually simply holding it here

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.540 
here is actually simply holding it here
similarly<00:02:06.380> all<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.950> arms<00:02:07.220> have<00:02:07.340> same

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
similarly all the arms have same

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.639 
similarly all the arms have same
mechanism<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.959> landing<00:02:09.259> gear

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
mechanism and the landing gear

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.020 
mechanism and the landing gear
this<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.009> screw<00:02:10.160> opens<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.820> whole

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
this is screw opens and the whole

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.300 
this is screw opens and the whole
landing<00:02:11.330> gear<00:02:11.510> comes<00:02:11.750> up<00:02:11.989> here<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.440> then<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
landing gear comes up here and then the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.790 
landing gear comes up here and then the
whole<00:02:13.520> arm<00:02:13.850> actually<00:02:14.600> folds<00:02:14.959> down<00:02:15.110> here<00:02:15.380> she

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
whole arm actually folds down here she

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440 
whole arm actually folds down here she
preparing<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.340> frame<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.760> basically<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.239> piece

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
preparing the frame is basically a piece

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
preparing the frame is basically a piece
of<00:02:17.630> cake<00:02:17.900> even<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> kid<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.530> prepare<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:19.250> I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
of cake even a kid can prepare it as I

say though for the convenience of my
customer<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.459> marked<00:02:22.820> all<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> EECS<00:02:23.269> as

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
customer I have marked all the EECS as

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.840 
customer I have marked all the EECS as
with<00:02:24.709> their<00:02:25.070> numbers<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:26.120> 1<00:02:26.630> 2<00:02:27.110> 3<00:02:27.470> 4<00:02:27.830> 5<00:02:28.040> 6<00:02:28.280> 7<00:02:28.489> 8

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
with their numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.970 
with their numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
80s<00:02:29.630> they<00:02:30.080> are<00:02:30.140> all<00:02:30.290> connected<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.860> their

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
80s they are all connected to their

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.850 
80s they are all connected to their
corresponding<00:02:31.670> motors<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.269> all<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.380> ESC<00:02:33.830> is

corresponding motors and all the ESC is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.240 
corresponding motors and all the ESC is
are<00:02:34.190> connected<00:02:34.940> let<00:02:35.360> me<00:02:35.450> move<00:02:35.900> down<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
are connected let me move down the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.199 
are connected let me move down the
middle<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.190> look<00:02:40.340> under<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:41.000> all

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
middle and if you look under here all

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.759 
middle and if you look under here all
the<00:02:41.390> EEOC's<00:02:41.810> are<00:02:41.930> connected<00:02:42.320> on<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> Power

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
the EEOC's are connected on a Power

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.220 
the EEOC's are connected on a Power
Distribution<00:02:43.070> board<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.570> all<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.840> need<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.110> do

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
Distribution board so all you need to do

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800 
Distribution board so all you need to do
is<00:02:45.410> red<00:02:45.709> goes<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.160> plus<00:02:46.430> black<00:02:47.030> goes<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.269> minus

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
is red goes to plus black goes to minus

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.560 
is red goes to plus black goes to minus
so<00:02:48.410> if<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.739> happen<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.400> have<00:02:49.640> one<00:02:49.790> ESC<00:02:50.269> become

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
so if you happen to have one ESC become

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.479 
so if you happen to have one ESC become
bad<00:02:50.750> or<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> few<00:02:51.260> es<00:02:51.530> es<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.040> actually

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
bad or a few es es you can actually

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.759 
bad or a few es es you can actually
easily<00:02:53.120> replace<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.780> ears<00:02:53.959> or<00:02:54.230> even<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> want

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
easily replace the ears or even you want

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.830 
easily replace the ears or even you want
to<00:02:54.890> change<00:02:55.070> them<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.370> 50<00:02:55.670> 60<00:02:55.820> amp<00:02:56.150> ESC<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.720> at

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
to change them to 50 60 amp ESC is at

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.750 
to change them to 50 60 amp ESC is at
the<00:02:56.930> moment<00:02:57.049> therefore<00:02:57.350> ta<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.340> easily

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the moment therefore ta you can easily

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.910 
the moment therefore ta you can easily
replace<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.450> replace<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> EEOC's<00:03:00.320> by<00:03:00.560> just

without<00:04:57.570> motors<00:04:58.139> connected<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.130> just

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
without motors connected so I just

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.719 
without motors connected so I just
connect<00:04:59.639> one<00:04:59.850> battery<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.930> W<00:05:01.260> camp<00:05:01.530> once<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> W
