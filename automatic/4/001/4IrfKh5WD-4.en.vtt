00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.800 
would go in all situations when I first
had<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> big<00:02:19.660> six<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.530> 2010<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.730> 2010<00:02:22.239> model<00:02:22.510> I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
had the big six in 2010 the 2010 model I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.320 
had the big six in 2010 the 2010 model I
went<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.530> polarizer<00:02:24.040> top<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:25.000> were<00:02:25.150> so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
went for polarizer top and we were so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.880 
went for polarizer top and we were so
pleased<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.930> them<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.349> think<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:26.799> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
pleased with them I think that's the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.850 
pleased with them I think that's the
paddles<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.459> sheers<00:02:27.819> save<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> day

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
paddles in the sheers save the day

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.740 
paddles in the sheers save the day
because<00:02:29.860> if<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.069> get<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.250> lot<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.519> trash<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
because if you get a lot of trash the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.000 
because if you get a lot of trash the
pedals<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> sheers<00:02:32.530> will<00:02:32.680> keep<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.980> going

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
pedals in the sheers will keep it going

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.550 
pedals in the sheers will keep it going
so<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.720> wouldn't<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.379> anything

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
so I would I wouldn't have anything

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.220 
so I would I wouldn't have anything
other<00:02:35.769> than<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.129> polarizer<00:02:36.640> top<00:02:36.910> or<00:02:37.060> no<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.450> in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
other than a polarizer top or no and in

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.920 
other than a polarizer top or no and in
saying<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:39.069> another<00:02:39.670> big<00:02:39.849> advantage<00:02:39.970> you

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
saying that another big advantage you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.420 
saying that another big advantage you
don't<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.440> go<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:41.860> way<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.099> row<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
don't have to go one way to row in the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.759 
don't have to go one way to row in the
field<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.849> can<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.720> short<00:02:44.230> work<00:02:44.440> whatever

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
field you can go on short work whatever

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.710 
field you can go on short work whatever
suits<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.700> go<00:02:45.849> with<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.420> elevator

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
suits you you can go with the elevator

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.330 
suits you you can go with the elevator
in<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.019> work<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.709> road<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:47.980> obviously<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
in the work the road and obviously you

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
in the work the road and obviously you
don't<00:02:48.519> want<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.760> run<00:02:48.849> loads<00:02:49.209> which<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.079> very

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
don't want to run loads which is a very

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.970 
don't want to run loads which is a very
good<00:02:50.709> advantage<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.420> new<00:02:52.599> type<00:02:52.870> shears<00:02:53.349> we

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
good advantage the new type shears we

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.319 
good advantage the new type shears we
always<00:02:54.250> thought<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.640> Jilly<00:02:54.910> shears<00:02:55.180> were

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
always thought the Jilly shears were

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.500 
always thought the Jilly shears were
good<00:02:55.569> but<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.709> believe<00:02:56.980> these<00:02:57.310> ones<00:02:57.579> are

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
good but I do believe these ones are

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.539 
good but I do believe these ones are
even<00:02:58.690> better<00:02:58.930> than<00:02:59.079> those<00:02:59.549> they're

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
even better than those they're

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.339 
even better than those they're
definitely<00:03:00.940> cheaper<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.599> simpler<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.049> run

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
definitely cheaper and simpler to run

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.190 
definitely cheaper and simpler to run
from<00:03:02.739> our<00:03:02.860> experience<00:03:03.540> we've<00:03:04.540> always<00:03:04.750> been

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
from our experience we've always been

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400 
from our experience we've always been
out<00:03:05.349> lifting<00:03:06.420> difficult<00:03:07.420> conditions<00:03:08.049> with<00:03:08.230> us

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
out lifting difficult conditions with us

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.250 
out lifting difficult conditions with us
Troy<00:03:08.860> you're<00:03:09.040> wet<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.579> can<00:03:10.090> honestly<00:03:10.510> proudly

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
Troy you're wet I can honestly proudly

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.710 
Troy you're wet I can honestly proudly
say<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.560> I've<00:03:11.950> lifted<00:03:12.220> beat<00:03:12.630> where<00:03:13.630> our

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
say that I've lifted beat where our

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.800 
say that I've lifted beat where our
other<00:03:13.959> machines<00:03:15.180> couldn't<00:03:16.180> work<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.660> big

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
other machines couldn't work the big

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.690 
other machines couldn't work the big
advantage<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.319> big<00:03:17.470> six<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.069> designed<00:03:18.489> to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
advantage of big six that is designed to

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.150 
advantage of big six that is designed to
be<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.819> 6-row<00:03:19.359> we<00:03:19.989> get<00:03:20.139> that<00:03:20.290> good<00:03:20.530> side<00:03:20.799> shift

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
be a 6-row we get that good side shift

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.280 
be a 6-row we get that good side shift
so<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.519> get<00:03:21.670> away<00:03:21.760> from<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.120> work

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.780 

another<00:03:30.290> big<00:03:30.530> advantage<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.550> full

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
another big advantage the full

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.460 
another big advantage the full
consumption<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.570> can<00:03:32.810> improve<00:03:33.200> the
