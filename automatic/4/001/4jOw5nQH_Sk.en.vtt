00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 How about friends today we will talk about the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.350
 importance of the plantain in the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.050
 phytotherapy for the treatment of 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.570
 respiratory diseases 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.450
 there are three kinds of plantain that are the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.200
 most used and known 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.140
 the plantain greater the plantain minor and the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.790
 plantain medium the three have 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.670
 expectorant antitussive properties 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.220
 anti-inflammatory and antiseptic drugs 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.650
 but of the three the one that has 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.860
 antispasmodic properties is the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.090
 plantain major therefore is ideal for 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.170
 treatment in asthma attacks or 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.400
 pneumonia or bronchial spasms 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.880
 this is the largest plantain me 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.799
 their leaves are wide and they are not so long 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.289
 it helps us differentiate ourselves from the others 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.780
 and understand the shape of their seeds that 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.670
 they are very long in firm balls 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 it is very important to recognize it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.450
 because this is the one that is ideal for the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 asthma treatment 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.880
 since they avoid the bronco spaces 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.580
 this greater plantain is very good in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.580
 climates and very wet lands 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.280
 and its leaves are wider 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.270
 The three species of plantain are 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.920
 characterized by having radical leaves or 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.470
 whether they are born directly from the root 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.230
 they differ among themselves in size and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.770
 shape of its leaves as well as the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.730
 length of its floral spike as 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.260
 we can see in these images 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.069
 that is, the three kinds of plantain 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.069
 The younger and the middle are born 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.659
 leaves from the same root and its flowers 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.659
 they are in the shape of spikes 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.940
 the platforms soften and dry at the same time 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.060
 the respiratory mucous membranes being 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.240
 this reason very useful in the healing of 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.150
 Asthma in acute bronchitis 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.150
 chronic and bronchial catarrh 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.819
 they also fluidize the secretions 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:59.870
 facilitate their elimination, it deflates the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.970
 bronchial mucosa and soothe the cough 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.230
 plantain has been used against 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonias 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 as a complement to the treatment 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.280
 specific 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.750
 this greater plantain that we observe in the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.170
 video is the one that has more effect 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.870
 expectorant and antispasmodic so to 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.870
 from now on we can recognize it
