00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
third expansion of the zerk there and if

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
third expansion of the zerk there and if
it<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.350> defended<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.180> obviously<00:01:39.180> if

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it can be defended or not obviously if

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.670 
it can be defended or not obviously if
it<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.540> defended<00:01:39.869> than<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> trailer

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it can be defended than the trailer

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
it can be defended than the trailer
usually<00:01:41.130> loses<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.909> can't<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
usually loses if it can't be then the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
usually loses if it can't be then the
Zerg<00:01:42.750> player<00:01:42.960> usually<00:01:43.110> loses<00:01:43.729> again<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Zerg player usually loses again this is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
Zerg player usually loses again this is
like<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.270> overview<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.320> every

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
like an overview this is not in every

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.800 
like an overview this is not in every
game<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:48.060> only<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
game or in it's only in like the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
game or in it's only in like the
majority<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.409> guess<00:01:49.680> where<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> percentage

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
majority I guess where the percentage

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.260 
majority I guess where the percentage
the<00:01:51.119> higher<00:01:51.299> percentage<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> games<00:01:53.270> again

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the higher percentage of games again

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.359 
the higher percentage of games again
constantly<00:01:54.659> Matt<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.110> 300<00:01:55.590> minerals<00:01:55.920> 700

constantly Matt going 300 minerals 700
gasps<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:57.149> good<00:01:57.329> ratio<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.530> high

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
gasps that's very good ratio I have high

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.139 
gasps that's very good ratio I have high
gas<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.310> once<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.670> vessels<00:01:59.969> start

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
gas because once my vessels start

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.580 
gas because once my vessels start
getting<00:02:00.360> pumped<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:01.049> guess<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
getting pumped out my guess is going to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
getting pumped out my guess is going to
get<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.920> low<00:02:02.689> killed<00:02:03.689> instead<00:02:03.840> expansion

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
get really low killed instead expansion

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.639 
get really low killed instead expansion
that's<00:02:04.829> huge<00:02:06.079> can<00:02:07.079> let<00:02:07.170> me<00:02:07.229> stress<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> little

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
that's huge can let me stress a little

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
that's huge can let me stress a little
more<00:02:07.950> oh<00:02:08.129> my<00:02:08.429> god<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.729> killed<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.090> third

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
more oh my god I killed a third

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
more oh my god I killed a third
expansion<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.289> how<00:02:10.590> important

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
expansion because that's how important

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.230 
expansion because that's how important
it<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.400> is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
it actually is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.270 
it actually is
yeah<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.350> see<00:02:13.380> he<00:02:13.800> bring<00:02:14.160> his

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
yeah and as you can see he bring his

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.830 
yeah and as you can see he bring his
liquors<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.820> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.120> too<00:02:15.240> late<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
liquors in a little bit too late so

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
liquors in a little bit too late so
those<00:02:16.770> letters<00:02:17.070> aren't<00:02:17.340> going<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.670> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
those letters aren't going to do that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.690 
those letters aren't going to do that
much<00:02:19.010> well<00:02:20.010> I've<00:02:20.100> seen<00:02:20.310> how<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.520> are<00:02:20.610> going

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
much well I've seen how they are going

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.210 
much well I've seen how they are going
to<00:02:20.790> do<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> lot<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:22.560> trapped<00:02:23.010> my

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to do a lot because I'm trapped my

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.830 
to do a lot because I'm trapped my
marine<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> medic<00:02:24.120> groups<00:02:24.300> are<00:02:24.420> trapped<00:02:24.660> here

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
marine and medic groups are trapped here

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
marine and medic groups are trapped here
so<00:02:25.310> he's<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.520> kill<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.940> these<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
so he's going to kill a lot of these and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210 
so he's going to kill a lot of these and
if<00:02:27.630> he<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.990> actually<00:02:28.380> position<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:28.890> liquor<00:02:29.070> as

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
if he can actually position as liquor as

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
if he can actually position as liquor as
well<00:02:29.370> enough<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.880> basically<00:02:30.240> get<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:30.810> Marines

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
was a little bit of that well I can't

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
was a little bit of that well I can't
talk<00:03:09.000> today<00:03:09.150> um<00:03:09.740> yeah<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.770> lost<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.130> those

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
talk today um yeah I lost all those

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.710 
talk today um yeah I lost all those
Marines<00:03:11.580> except<00:03:12.120> he<00:03:12.210> lost<00:03:12.390> his<00:03:12.570> third

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
Marines except he lost his third

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360 
Marines except he lost his third
expansion<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.590> got<00:03:13.800> my<00:03:13.950> third<00:03:14.100> expansion

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
expansion and I got my third expansion

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.760 
expansion and I got my third expansion
so<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.090> think<00:03:15.210> it's<00:03:15.630> going<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:15.930> worth<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.290> I'm

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
so I think it's going to be worth it I'm

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.050 
so I think it's going to be worth it I'm
not<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> third<00:03:17.850> expansion

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
not really going for the third expansion

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.430 
not really going for the third expansion
is<00:03:18.330> like<00:03:18.540> I'm<00:03:18.690> not<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.990> try<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.110> defend

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
is like I'm not going to try to defend

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
is like I'm not going to try to defend
it<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.710> well<00:03:19.860> because<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.550> know<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.360> going

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
it that well because I know it's going

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.330 
it that well because I know it's going
to<00:03:21.570> die<00:03:21.690> guaranteed<00:03:22.380> because<00:03:22.590> usually<00:03:22.860> turn

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
to die guaranteed because usually turn

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.760 
to die guaranteed because usually turn
Mercer<00:03:24.080> turns<00:03:25.080> never<00:03:25.320> supposed<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.650> ahead

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
Mercer turns never supposed to be ahead

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.380 
Mercer turns never supposed to be ahead
and<00:03:26.040> expansions<00:03:26.550> if<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.820> are<00:03:27.030> then<00:03:27.240> you're

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
and expansions if you are then you're

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.300 
and expansions if you are then you're
really<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:27.840> winning<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.860> I'm<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.220> not

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
really really winning so I'm just not

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.650 
really really winning so I'm just not
going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.490> really<00:03:29.700> bother<00:03:29.940> her<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:30.330> defended

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
going to really bother her and defended

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.840 
going to really bother her and defended
I'm<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.900> getting<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:31.980> it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
I'm just getting it so it's like it's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.280 
I'm just getting it so it's like it's
like<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.000> target<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.540> him<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.780> attack<00:03:34.020> like

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
like a target for him to attack like

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.780 
like a target for him to attack like
very<00:03:34.530> than<00:03:34.680> attacking<00:03:34.920> my<00:03:35.160> base<00:03:35.340> he<00:03:35.520> just<00:03:35.670> has

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
very than attacking my base he just has

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.540 
very than attacking my base he just has
to<00:03:35.820> attack<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.240> third<00:03:36.420> expansion<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.550> he

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
to attack that third expansion and he

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.250 
to attack that third expansion and he
probably<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.120> go<00:03:39.210> for<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.540> I'm

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
probably is going to go for it I'm

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.750 
probably is going to go for it I'm
transferring<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.740> little<00:03:40.920> bit<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.130> SUVs<00:03:41.460> again

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
transferring a little bit of SUVs again

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.880 
transferring a little bit of SUVs again
not<00:03:41.970> heavily<00:03:42.270> defending<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.840> expansion<00:03:43.200> if

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
not heavily defending this expansion if

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.650 
not heavily defending this expansion if
I<00:03:44.040> lose<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.270> be<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.360> far

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
I lose this I'm not going to be that far

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940 
I lose this I'm not going to be that far
beat<00:03:45.780> wall<00:03:45.960> I'll<00:03:46.200> still<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.530> ahead<00:03:46.620> because

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
beat wall I'll still be ahead because

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.770 
beat wall I'll still be ahead because
two<00:03:47.490> basis<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.880> race<00:03:47.940> two<00:03:48.120> bases<00:03:48.450> trying<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
something key right there i steamed my

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.320 
something key right there i steamed my
Marines<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.280> put<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.490> bath<00:03:59.640> put<00:04:00.060> them<00:04:00.240> back

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
Marines and put the bath put them back

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.240 
Marines and put the bath put them back
in<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.570> bunker<00:04:00.720> that's<00:04:01.530> really<00:04:01.740> important<00:04:02.160> I

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
in the bunker that's really important I

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.620 
in the bunker that's really important I
probably<00:04:02.430> did<00:04:02.640> doubled<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> damaged<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.540> I

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
probably did doubled the damaged and I

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.060 
probably did doubled the damaged and I
could<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:03.930> done<00:04:04.020> before<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:04.920> I'm

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
could have done before and now I'm

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.040 
could have done before and now I'm
trying<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> run<00:04:05.580> my<00:04:05.730> CVS<00:04:06.390> before<00:04:06.690> they<00:04:06.780> all<00:04:06.870> die

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
trying to run my CVS before they all die

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.050 
trying to run my CVS before they all die
I<00:04:07.320> knew<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.310> knew<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.610> space<00:04:08.790> would<00:04:08.940> die

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
I knew this I knew the space would die

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.250 
I knew this I knew the space would die
so<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.330> didn't<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:09.720> bother<00:04:09.810> trying<00:04:10.170> to

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
so I didn't really bother trying to

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.080 
so I didn't really bother trying to
defend<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.800> now<00:04:10.950> scored<00:04:11.520> this<00:04:11.640> coming<00:04:11.970> in

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
defend it and now scored this coming in

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.710 
defend it and now scored this coming in
to<00:04:12.300> kill<00:04:12.480> my<00:04:12.980> my<00:04:13.980> sign<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:14.760> sorry<00:04:15.480> my

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
guess I thought that was kind of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.490 
guess I thought that was kind of
careless<00:05:45.419> in<00:05:45.630> my<00:05:45.720> part<00:05:45.960> though<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.260> shouldn't

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
careless in my part though I shouldn't

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.930 
careless in my part though I shouldn't
have<00:05:46.590> lost<00:05:46.710> either<00:05:46.919> because<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.550> was<00:05:47.669> really

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
have lost either because it was really

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.400 
have lost either because it was really
close<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.240> my<00:05:48.330> medical<00:05:48.510> marine<00:05:48.900> group<00:05:49.050> if<00:05:49.320> I

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
close to my medical marine group if I

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.690 
close to my medical marine group if I
just<00:05:49.590> moved<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.860> little<00:05:49.919> bit<00:05:50.190> back<00:05:50.340> the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
just moved it a little bit back the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.120 
just moved it a little bit back the
other<00:05:50.729> vessel<00:05:51.210> wouldn't<00:05:51.419> have<00:05:51.510> died<00:05:52.010> but<00:05:53.010> now

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
other vessel wouldn't have died but now

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.100 
other vessel wouldn't have died but now
I<00:05:53.160> have<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.370> really<00:05:53.550> huge<00:05:54.120> like<00:05:54.419> I<00:05:54.539> 138

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.990 
I have a really huge like I 138
population<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.220> guys<00:05:56.340> can<00:05:56.580> just<00:05:56.729> see<00:05:56.850> my

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
population and you guys can just see my

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.469 
population and you guys can just see my
army<00:05:57.690> count<00:05:57.900> it's<00:05:58.200> very<00:05:58.350> huge<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.330> yeah<00:06:00.330> this

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
army count it's very huge and yeah this

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.719 
army count it's very huge and yeah this
army<00:06:00.750> counts<00:06:01.050> really<00:06:01.260> huge<00:06:01.440> so<00:06:01.680> this<00:06:02.460> is

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
army counts really huge so this is

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.279 
army counts really huge so this is
probably<00:06:03.000> going<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.240> be<00:06:03.300> like<00:06:03.479> my<00:06:03.780> main<00:06:03.990> push

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
probably going to be like my main push

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.219 
probably going to be like my main push
right<00:06:04.440> now<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.889> once<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:05.580> turn<00:06:06.330> berserk<00:06:06.990> it

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
right now and once like turn berserk it

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.260 
right now and once like turn berserk it
usually<00:06:07.470> comes<00:06:07.800> down<00:06:08.039> to<00:06:08.220> trans<00:06:08.490> main<00:06:08.970> main

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
usually comes down to trans main main

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.080 
usually comes down to trans main main
push<00:06:09.600> succeeding<00:06:10.260> or<00:06:10.350> failing<00:06:10.410> and<00:06:11.090> usually

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
push succeeding or failing and usually

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.790

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
the lurkers splash the hell out of them

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.700 
the lurkers splash the hell out of them
you<00:06:17.630> splash<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.810> hell<00:06:18.960> out<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.380> Marines

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
liquors and so usually one or the other

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.580 
liquors and so usually one or the other
race<00:06:25.410> wins<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:25.950> really<00:06:26.160> badly<00:06:26.340> and<00:06:26.990> as<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.500> can

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
race wins it really badly and as you can

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.110 
race wins it really badly and as you can
see<00:06:28.620> he<00:06:29.010> has<00:06:29.100> a<00:06:29.130> lot<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.340> heusen<00:06:29.729> of<00:06:29.820> that<00:06:29.940> many

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
see he has a lot of heusen of that many

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.879 
see he has a lot of heusen of that many
lurkers<00:06:30.300> that's<00:06:30.660> actually<00:06:30.960> very<00:06:30.990> bad<00:06:31.410> liquor

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
lurkers that's actually very bad liquor

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.040

now I made my other marine stem and that

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.680 
now I made my other marine stem and that
went<00:07:09.950> around<00:07:10.100> also<00:07:10.490> so<00:07:10.670> I<00:07:10.700> lost<00:07:10.940> its<00:07:11.120> very<00:07:11.420> very
