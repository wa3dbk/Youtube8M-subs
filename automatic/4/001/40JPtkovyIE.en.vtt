nine my grandmother was a writer and I

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.260 
nine my grandmother was a writer and I
really<00:00:29.730> admired<00:00:30.090> her<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.360> she<00:00:30.840> encouraged<00:00:31.529> me

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
really admired her and she encouraged me

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.210 
really admired her and she encouraged me
she<00:00:33.270> gave<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.720> typewriter<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.710> me<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.100> was

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
she gave me a typewriter to me it was

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.460 
she gave me a typewriter to me it was
like<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> musical<00:00:35.550> instrument<00:00:35.970> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
like a musical instrument you know I

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.030 
like a musical instrument you know I
could<00:00:38.040> make<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:38.370> talk<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.449> I<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.830> why

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
could make it talk and I don't know why

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.860 
could make it talk and I don't know why
but<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.370> seemed<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.940> part<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.360> process

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
but that seemed like part of the process

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.920 
but that seemed like part of the process
which<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> missing<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.340> computer

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
which is missing now with computer

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.079 
which is missing now with computer
I<00:00:46.460> started<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.550> Yankee<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.089> 1978<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.910> started<00:00:50.910> as

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
I started at Yankee in 1978 I started as

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.640 
I started at Yankee in 1978 I started as
a<00:00:51.600> proofreader<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.530> quite

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
a proofreader and it was actually quite

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.740 
a proofreader and it was actually quite
a<00:00:55.769> quite<00:00:56.339> a<00:00:56.370> long<00:00:56.549> drive<00:00:56.909> from<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.479> was

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
a quite a long drive from where I was

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
a quite a long drive from where I was
living<00:00:58.129> but<00:00:59.129> I<00:01:00.979> sort<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.040> got<00:01:02.190> hooked<00:01:02.460> on

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
living but I sort of got hooked on

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.960 
living but I sort of got hooked on
Yankee<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.680> seemed<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.280> sense<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Yankee and so it seemed to make sense to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.380 
Yankee and so it seemed to make sense to
move<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.690> then<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:08.520> farm<00:01:08.909> came<00:01:09.240> up

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
move up here and then this farm came up

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
move up here and then this farm came up
for<00:01:09.630> sale<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.010> scary<00:01:11.460> because

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
for sale and it was really scary because

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.280 
for sale and it was really scary because
all<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.180> fields<00:01:12.450> seemed<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.229> were

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
all these fields seemed like they were

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
all these fields seemed like they were
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> developed<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.630> developer<00:01:15.630> was

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going to be developed a developer was

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to be developed a developer was
really<00:01:16.049> interested<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.650> buying<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.159> fields

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
really interested in buying these fields

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.710 
really interested in buying these fields
in<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.939> house<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.030> group<00:01:21.390> got

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
in this house and and so a group got

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.370 
in this house and and so a group got
together<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> group<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.380> we

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
together and I was in the group and we
were<00:01:25.500> trying<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> find<00:01:26.039> somebody<00:01:26.369> who<00:01:26.729> would

do I think is especially after Paul's
book<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:12.030> place<00:03:12.239> he<00:03:12.480> made<00:03:12.630> was<00:03:12.870> published

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
to receive that because I mean it's a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.699
