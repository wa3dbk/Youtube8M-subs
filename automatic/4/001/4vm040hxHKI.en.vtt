00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
dr. McCleary can you talk a little bit

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.139 
dr. McCleary can you talk a little bit
about<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.800> benefits<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.190> krill<00:00:02.490> oil<00:00:02.610> we<00:00:02.879> hear

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
about the benefits of krill oil we hear

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.760 
about the benefits of krill oil we hear
a<00:00:03.179> lot<00:00:03.360> about<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.899> know<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.170> fish<00:00:04.350> oil<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
a lot about you know the fish oil the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.000 
a lot about you know the fish oil the
Omega<00:00:05.040> threes<00:00:05.540> is<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.830> good<00:00:07.830> alternative

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
Omega threes is that a good alternative

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.990 
Omega threes is that a good alternative
as<00:00:08.550> well<00:00:08.719> well<00:00:09.719> fish<00:00:10.710> oil<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.340> people<00:00:11.730> think

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
as well well fish oil what people think

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.220 
as well well fish oil what people think
of<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.660> fish<00:00:13.019> oil<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:14.160> fish<00:00:14.880> body<00:00:15.360> oil<00:00:15.719> they

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of as fish oil is is fish body oil they

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170 
of as fish oil is is fish body oil they
basically<00:00:16.619> take<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> fish<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.670> compress<00:00:18.150> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
basically take a fish and compress it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.710 
basically take a fish and compress it
and<00:00:18.650> squeeze<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.250> oils<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and squeeze out the oils that are in the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.340 
and squeeze out the oils that are in the
body<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> fish<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.180> those<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:25.080> type

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
body of the fish and those are one type

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.960 
body of the fish and those are one type

long-chain<00:00:37.440> omega-3s<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.610> fish<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
long-chain omega-3s from fish is that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.119 
long-chain omega-3s from fish is that
fish<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> end<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> food<00:00:42.899> chain

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
fish are at the end of the food chain

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
fish are at the end of the food chain
big<00:00:44.129> fish<00:00:44.399> eat<00:00:44.610> smaller<00:00:45.000> fish<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.750> forth

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
big fish eat smaller fish and so forth

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
big fish eat smaller fish and so forth
and<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> concentrate<00:00:47.420> heavy<00:00:48.420> metals

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and they can concentrate heavy metals

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.490 
and they can concentrate heavy metals
which<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.760> avoided<00:00:51.260> one<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
which is to be avoided one of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.459 
which is to be avoided one of the
benefits<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> krill<00:00:53.610> oil<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.899> krill

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
benefits of krill oil is that krill

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.750 
benefits of krill oil is that krill
basically<00:00:58.469> eat<00:00:59.989> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.770> lowest<00:01:02.309> end<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.699> the

omega-3s and their little crustaceans
which<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.060> eaten<00:01:12.420> by<00:01:12.450> small<00:01:12.659> fish

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
which are then eaten by small fish

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
which are then eaten by small fish
bigger<00:01:13.619> fish<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.310> forth<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.790> they're<00:01:15.030> at

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
bigger fish and so forth so they're at

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
bigger fish and so forth so they're at
the<00:01:15.330> low<00:01:15.509> end<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> food<00:01:16.170> chain<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.770> they

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the low end of the food chain so they

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.230 
the low end of the food chain so they
essentially<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.299> no<00:01:19.080> heavy<00:01:19.799> metals<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.610> no

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
essentially have no heavy metals and no

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
essentially have no heavy metals and no
heavy<00:01:21.479> metal<00:01:21.900> toxicity<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.220> other<00:01:23.369> advantage

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
heavy metal toxicity the other advantage

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
heavy metal toxicity the other advantage
there<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> couple<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.869> advantages<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
there are a couple of advantages of the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
there are a couple of advantages of the
Omega<00:01:26.640> threes<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.509> fish<00:01:27.810> oil<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> those

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Omega threes from fish oil and those

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.330 
Omega threes from fish oil and those
include<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> fact<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
include the fact that they are a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
include the fact that they are a
phospholipid<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.000> don't<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
phospholipid so they don't have to be

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380 
phospholipid so they don't have to be
refrigerated<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.829> they're<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.909> more

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
refrigerated and they're also more

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.170 
refrigerated and they're also more
readily<00:01:36.810> absorbed<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.560> call<00:01:37.799> that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
readily absorbed we call that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
readily absorbed we call that
bioavailable<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> need<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.290> eat<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bioavailable so you need to eat a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.760 
bioavailable so you need to eat a
smaller<00:01:41.759> portion<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.619> your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
smaller portion of them to get what your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
smaller portion of them to get what your
body<00:01:44.040> needs<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> third<00:01:45.030> advantage<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
body needs and the third advantage is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
body needs and the third advantage is
that<00:01:46.100> krill<00:01:47.100> oil<00:01:47.479> naturally<00:01:48.479> contains<00:01:49.280> some

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that krill oil naturally contains some

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.359 
that krill oil naturally contains some
very<00:01:50.520> powerful<00:01:51.439> antioxidants<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.040> not

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
very powerful antioxidants which not

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.389 
very powerful antioxidants which not
only<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:54.030> healthy<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.960> our<00:01:55.140> bodies<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.100> they

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
only are healthy for our bodies but they

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
only are healthy for our bodies but they
are<00:01:56.610> preservatives<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
are preservatives really for the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.120 
are preservatives really for the
delicate<00:01:59.369> fats<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.450> omega-3<00:02:01.170> fats<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.770> in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
delicate fats the omega-3 fats and in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.600 
delicate fats the omega-3 fats and in
krill<00:02:02.579> oil<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.930> many<00:02:04.110> benefits<00:02:04.680> for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
krill oil so there are many benefits for

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.449 
krill oil so there are many benefits for
krill<00:02:06.540> oil<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.439> krill<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.860> basically<00:02:08.250> right

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
krill oil and krill is basically right

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
krill oil and krill is basically right
