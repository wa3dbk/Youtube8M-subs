00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
feel most alive as a painter because you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.750 
feel most alive as a painter because you
have<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.379> be<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.680> present<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.489> have<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.670> be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
have to be so present and you have to be

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.670 
have to be so present and you have to be
so<00:03:25.970> connected<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.049> moment<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:27.530> you're

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
so connected to the moment that you're

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.170 
so connected to the moment that you're
in<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.159> we<00:03:28.220> start<00:03:28.459> at<00:03:28.519> one<00:03:28.640> end<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:28.939> painting

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
in and we start at one end of a painting

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.550 
in and we start at one end of a painting
and<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.420> light<00:03:29.569> changes<00:03:29.959> as<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.140> move<00:03:30.170> across

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
and the light changes as you move across

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.600 
and the light changes as you move across
that<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.890> actually<00:03:31.040> have<00:03:31.310> almost<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.579> a

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
that you actually have almost like a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.670 
that you actually have almost like a
time<00:03:31.879> lapse<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.510> tide<00:03:32.780> may<00:03:32.989> rise<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.260> fall

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
time lapse the tide may rise and fall

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.710 
time lapse the tide may rise and fall
does<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.129> angle<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.640> Sun<00:03:34.849> may<00:03:35.090> change

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
does the angle of the Sun may change

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.330 
does the angle of the Sun may change
that's<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.560> challenge<00:03:36.920> have<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.099> kind<00:03:37.250> of

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
that's the challenge have to kind of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.099 
that's the challenge have to kind of
synthesize<00:03:37.879> and<00:03:38.150> process<00:03:38.569> all<00:03:38.689> that<00:03:38.870> stuff

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
synthesize and process all that stuff

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.690 
synthesize and process all that stuff
and<00:03:39.379> then<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.829> have<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.010> put<00:03:40.189> something<00:03:40.400> down

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
and then you have to put something down

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.149 
and then you have to put something down
that<00:03:40.730> becomes<00:03:41.299> one<00:03:41.689> moment<00:03:42.260> how<00:03:42.769> long<00:03:42.950> does<00:03:43.099> it

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
that becomes one moment how long does it

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.130 
that becomes one moment how long does it
