things the durability in this boot is a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
things the durability in this boot is a
massive<00:00:26.970> component<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> why<00:00:27.900> we're<00:00:28.080> such<00:00:28.230> big

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
massive component to why we're such big

massive component to why we're such big
fans<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.880> normally<00:00:30.300> I'd<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.869> or

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
fans of it when normally I'd get one or

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
fans of it when normally I'd get one or
two<00:00:31.080> seasons<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.099> boot<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.520> could<00:00:32.700> get

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
two seasons out of a boot I could get

two or four out of a Ken attract so the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.370 
two or four out of a Ken attract so the
durability<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> long-lasting<00:00:36.630> nature<00:00:37.290> of

durability and long-lasting nature of
this<00:00:37.500> boot<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> things<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this boot is one of the things that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
this boot is one of the things that
really<00:00:39.120> makes<00:00:39.510> me<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> fan<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:41.100> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
really makes me be a fan of it now this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
really makes me be a fan of it now this
one<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.879> their<00:00:42.270> uninsulated<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.290> haven't

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

for ninety percent applications the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
for ninety percent applications the
uninsulated<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> work<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.140> for

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
uninsulated is going to work better for

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
uninsulated is going to work better for
you<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:50.610> does<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.539> point<00:00:51.899> eight

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you it does have a two point eight

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
you it does have a two point eight
millimeter<00:00:53.070> thickness<00:00:53.430> leather<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.539> that's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
millimeter thickness leather now that's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
millimeter thickness leather now that's
where<00:00:55.020> you're<00:00:55.170> getting<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> stiffness<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
where you're getting that stiffness that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
where you're getting that stiffness that
you<00:00:56.699> need<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.570> ankle<00:00:57.899> support<00:00:58.050> you're

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you need to for ankle support you're

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
you need to for ankle support you're
also<00:00:58.620> getting<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> durability<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> we

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
also getting the durability with that we

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
also getting the durability with that we
also<00:01:01.020> notice<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> boot<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> they

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
also notice on the boot that they

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.600 
also notice on the boot that they
brought<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.480> rubber<00:01:03.870> piece<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:05.010> onto

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
brought that that rubber piece up onto

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
brought that that rubber piece up onto
the<00:01:05.700> boot<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.270> handle<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.159> abrasion<00:01:08.159> from

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the boot to handle with abrasion from

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.530 
the boot to handle with abrasion from
rocks<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.970> sort<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
rocks and that sort of thing in that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
rocks and that sort of thing in that
that<00:01:09.810> system<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.470> works<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.369> don't

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that system really works well we don't

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.330 
that system really works well we don't
see<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.060> breakdown<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> readiness

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
see that breakdown just the readiness

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.760 
see that breakdown just the readiness

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
grab onto that rock edge when you're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
grab onto that rock edge when you're
trying<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> catch<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.259> make<00:01:22.320> those<00:01:22.979> moves

trying to catch it and make those moves

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
trying to catch it and make those moves
that<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> make<00:01:25.220> one<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> keys

with<00:01:27.000> any<00:01:27.299> boot<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.020> waterproofness<00:01:28.710> it's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
with any boot is waterproofness it's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
with any boot is waterproofness it's
important<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.820> only<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.840> two

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
important not only right now but two

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.210 
important not only right now but two
years<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.680> they're<00:01:31.979> still

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
years from now that they're still

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.859 
years from now that they're still
waterproof<00:01:32.579> because<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.150> soon<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.630> lose

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
waterproof because as soon as they lose

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
waterproof because as soon as they lose
that<00:01:34.310> they're<00:01:35.310> difficult<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.850> wear<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that they're difficult to wear in the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.270 
that they're difficult to wear in the
field<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:37.290> keep<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.650> mind<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> things

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
field now keep in mind one of the things

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
field now keep in mind one of the things
that<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> Ken<00:01:38.640> Ettrick<00:01:38.970> does<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:40.049> helps<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that the Ken Ettrick does that helps it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
that the Ken Ettrick does that helps it
