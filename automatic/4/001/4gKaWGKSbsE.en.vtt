yeah<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
yeah and you can see right here this is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.369 
yeah and you can see right here this is
a<00:01:00.059> problem<00:01:00.360> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> lose<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> ball<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a problem when you lose the ball in that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.649 
a problem when you lose the ball in that
area<00:01:01.550> Pierre<00:01:02.550> Meyer<00:01:02.820> gets<00:01:03.059> caught<00:01:03.300> going

area Pierre Meyer gets caught going

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.389 
area Pierre Meyer gets caught going
forward<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.290> means<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.129> hand

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
forward so that means the right hand

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.219 
forward so that means the right hand
side<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.790> wide<00:01:06.030> open<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.509> ball<00:01:06.720> gets<00:01:06.930> played

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
what Erwin did a great job good time he

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.280 
what Erwin did a great job good time he
came<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.180> he<00:01:12.330> made<00:01:12.509> himself<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.899> big<00:01:13.140> as

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
came out he made himself as big as

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
came out he made himself as big as
powerful<00:01:13.770> possible<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> makes<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.119> great<00:01:15.390> safe
