00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
basically this not the axle nut is what

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.200 
basically this not the axle nut is what
has<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
has to start at all and this is

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
has to start at all and this is
extremely<00:00:48.210> difficult<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.140> first<00:00:49.469> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
extremely difficult to get out first of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.020 
extremely difficult to get out first of
all<00:00:49.739> there's<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.309> dimple<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.700> there

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
all there's a little dimple right there

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.240 
all there's a little dimple right there
you<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> remove<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.770> wasn't<00:00:52.980> easy

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you have to remove and that wasn't easy

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
you have to remove and that wasn't easy
with<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> screwdriver<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.780> strong

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
with a screwdriver very strong

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.340 
with a screwdriver very strong
screwdriver<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.860> hammer<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.629> basically

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
screwdriver a hammer and then basically

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
screwdriver a hammer and then basically
you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> either<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> three<00:00:59.370> foot<00:01:00.079> breaker

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you can either get a three foot breaker

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
you can either get a three foot breaker
bar<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> stand<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> guy<00:01:03.180> off

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
bar and stand on it and get this guy off

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
bar and stand on it and get this guy off
that's<00:01:03.719> how<00:01:03.840> difficult<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that's how difficult it is or if you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.960 
that's how difficult it is or if you
just<00:01:05.519> run<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> store<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
just run out to the store and get a

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.310 
just run out to the store and get a
cordless<00:01:09.290> impact<00:01:10.290> wrench

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
cordless impact wrench

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
cordless impact wrench
so<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> impact<00:01:13.740> wrench<00:01:14.010> makes<00:01:14.700> things<00:01:14.909> real

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
so the impact wrench makes things real

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
so the impact wrench makes things real
easy<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:16.759> comes<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> axle<00:01:18.330> nut<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.520> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
easy here comes the axle nut and that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600 
easy here comes the axle nut and that
right<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> actual

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
right there is the end of the actual

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
right there is the end of the actual
axle<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.390> replacing<00:01:24.720> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
axle that I'm going to be replacing but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
axle that I'm going to be replacing but
now<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> axle<00:01:26.189> nut<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.460> off<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> next

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
now that the axle nut is off the next

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.090 
now that the axle nut is off the next
thing<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> unscrew<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:31.350> guys<00:01:31.710> right

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
thing is to unscrew these guys right

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.590 
thing is to unscrew these guys right
here<00:01:32.240> alright<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
here alright so as we can see this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.310 
here alright so as we can see this
infamously<00:01:36.890> awful<00:01:37.890> screw<00:01:38.630> has<00:01:39.630> been<00:01:39.689> stripped

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
infamously awful screw has been stripped

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.469 
infamously awful screw has been stripped
believe<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.159> stripped<00:01:41.490> already<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
believe it was stripped already but it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
believe it was stripped already but it
stripped<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.079> bit<00:01:43.170> more<00:01:43.350> I'm<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.159> sure

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we're gonna do about getting the rotor

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.560 
we're gonna do about getting the rotor

assembly I'm gonna have to get to 17
inch<00:02:07.020> bolts<00:02:07.380> 17<00:02:08.340> millimeter<00:02:08.700> bolts<00:02:09.229> there's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
inch bolts 17 millimeter bolts there's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:23.059 
inch bolts 17 millimeter bolts there's
one<00:02:11.030> at<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> bottom<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:20.750> goodness<00:02:21.830> there<00:02:22.830> we

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
one at the bottom one goodness there we

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.620 
one at the bottom one goodness there we
go

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.059 

hold<00:02:27.630> onto<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.989> caliper<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.620> there's<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.860> fall

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
hold onto the caliper so there's a fall

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.620 
hold onto the caliper so there's a fall

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.290 
that's easy okay after snapping off this
part<00:05:32.949> of<00:05:33.159> the<00:05:33.400> axle<00:05:35.699> there<00:05:36.699> was<00:05:36.849> still<00:05:37.060> some

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
part of the axle there was still some

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.570 
part of the axle there was still some
left<00:05:37.449> at<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:37.780> end<00:05:37.930> that's<00:05:38.229> just<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.560> boot<00:05:38.770> and

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
left at the end that's just the boot and

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.339 
left at the end that's just the boot and
here<00:05:39.940> it<00:05:40.090> is<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.919> other<00:05:42.069> piece<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.580> puzzle

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
here it is the other piece of the puzzle

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.689 
here it is the other piece of the puzzle
so<00:05:44.349> now<00:05:45.389> there<00:05:46.389> we<00:05:46.690> go<00:05:46.930> there's<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.979> hole<00:05:48.219> for

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
so now there we go there's the hole for

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.809 
so now there we go there's the hole for
the<00:05:48.879> new<00:05:49.150> axle<00:05:50.129> that's<00:05:51.129> gonna<00:05:51.310> run<00:05:51.550> through

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
the new axle that's gonna run through

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.930 
the new axle that's gonna run through
there<00:05:52.000> through<00:05:52.870> this<00:05:53.050> fork<00:05:53.759> into<00:05:54.759> that

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
there through this fork into that

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.240 
there through this fork into that
spindle<00:05:55.710> here<00:05:56.710> we<00:05:56.800> have<00:05:56.919> a<00:05:56.949> new<00:05:57.129> axle<00:05:59.129> that's<00:06:00.129> a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
spindle here we have a new axle that's a

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.030 
spindle here we have a new axle that's a
good<00:06:00.460> looking<00:06:00.699> home
