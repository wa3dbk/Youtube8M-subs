with<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> death<00:00:20.400> machine<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> war

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
with the death machine and the war

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.130 
with the death machine and the war
machine<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.750> work<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.900> other

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
weapons or all the killstreaks so it's a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.220

very<00:00:24.029> simple<00:00:24.420> glitch<00:00:24.570> guys<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.080> all<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
very simple glitch guys and all you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.509 
very simple glitch guys and all you
wanna<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.529> basically<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:26.340> war

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
wanna do is basically just get your war

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
wanna do is basically just get your war
machine<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.300> death<00:00:27.480> machine<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.560> this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
machine and your death machine and this

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.870 
machine and your death machine and this
make<00:00:28.890> sure<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.279> save<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.640> least<00:00:29.670> one

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
make sure you have save at least one

make sure you have save at least one
bullet<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> gun<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.320> cannot<00:00:31.529> run

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bullet in the gun so you just cannot run

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
bullet in the gun so you just cannot run
out<00:00:31.859> fully<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.610> ammo<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.390> guys<00:00:33.480> need<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> keep

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
out fully of ammo you guys need to keep

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
out fully of ammo you guys need to keep
a<00:00:33.930> less<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.320> bullet<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> war

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a less one bullet in it now the war

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.830 
a less one bullet in it now the war
machine<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> lot<00:00:36.360> easier<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.660> do

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
machine this will be a lot easier to do

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.119 
machine this will be a lot easier to do
than<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> death<00:00:37.590> machine<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
than with the death machine because the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
than with the death machine because the
death<00:00:38.250> machine<00:00:38.370> shoots<00:00:38.790> incredibly<00:00:39.270> fast<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
death machine shoots incredibly fast and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
death machine shoots incredibly fast and
you<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.379> might<00:00:40.649> burn<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> mo<00:00:41.280> pretty<00:00:41.460> fast

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you as might burn to the mo pretty fast

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.170 
you as might burn to the mo pretty fast
but<00:00:42.410> once<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> guys<00:00:43.620> save<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.670> weapon<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
but once you guys save your weapon and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.819 
but once you guys save your weapon and
you<00:00:45.270> guys<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.660> bolt<00:00:45.840> left<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.710> know

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you guys have one bolt left or you know

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
you guys have one bolt left or you know
just<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.129> 5<00:00:47.370> 10<00:00:47.550> bullets<00:00:47.760> doesn't<00:00:48.239> matter<00:00:48.360> as

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
just like 5 10 bullets doesn't matter as

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000 
just like 5 10 bullets doesn't matter as
long<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> don't<00:00:49.379> run<00:00:49.500> completely<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:49.980> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
long as you don't run completely out of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
long as you don't run completely out of
ammo<00:00:50.219> once<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> guys<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.660> guys<00:00:52.230> want

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
ammo once you guys do that you guys want

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
ammo once you guys do that you guys want
to<00:00:52.620> wait<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> weapon<00:00:53.430> until<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> round

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to wait with that weapon until the round

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
to wait with that weapon until the round
switch<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> guys<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.590> away<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
switch that you guys can put it away is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
switch that you guys can put it away is
doing<00:00:56.160> need<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.789> again<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
doing need to have it out again but you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.430 
doing need to have it out again but you
guys<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.750> need<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.140> sure<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> guys

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
guys just need to make sure you guys

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
guys just need to make sure you guys
don't<00:00:58.530> waste<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> EMA<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.430> said<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.239> once

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
don't waste the EMA like I said now once

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.520 
don't waste the EMA like I said now once
you<00:01:00.480> guys<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> round<00:01:01.140> switches

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you guys do that in the round switches

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.869 
you guys do that in the round switches
it<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.800> give<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> guys<00:01:02.129> full<00:01:02.370> ammo<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it will give you guys full ammo for the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
it will give you guys full ammo for the
weapon<00:01:03.149> again<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.989> guys<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
weapon again now you guys can do this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
weapon again now you guys can do this
multiple<00:01:04.710> times<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.159> guys<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.460> playing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
multiple times you guys are playing

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980 
multiple times you guys are playing
demolition<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> guys<00:01:06.600> switched<00:01:06.840> around

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
demolition and you guys switched around

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
demolition and you guys switched around
twice<00:01:07.350> it'll<00:01:08.010> work<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> it'll<00:01:08.790> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
twice it'll work like that it'll just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
twice it'll work like that it'll just
keep<00:01:09.119> adding<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.780> ammo<00:01:10.140> every<00:01:10.380> time<00:01:10.500> around

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
keep adding more ammo every time around

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
keep adding more ammo every time around
switches<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> only<00:01:12.150> does<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.479> during<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
switches but it only does it during the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149 
switches but it only does it during the
round<00:01:12.960> switch<00:01:13.229> guys<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.710> keep<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.040> mind
