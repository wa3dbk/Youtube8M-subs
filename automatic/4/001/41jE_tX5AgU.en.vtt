00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.080
 is today has already been talked about all 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.630
 it is during the day and evening 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.759
 that today Miguel Herrera is going to sit 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.189
 with the three team goalkeepers 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.490
 Mexican and he will tell you sir is the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.650
 goalkeeper and goalkeeper of Cameroon 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.020
 brazil and croatia for mexico will be 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.980
 flying on such a side 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.750
 What do I say about the three of them? 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 did not fall a puppy and nothing else if we 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.870
 there are two I do not think the competition 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.360
 between comillas is between guillermo ochoa 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 and josé de jesús corona 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.650
 Talavera from the beginning I imagine 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 that he knew he was going as a third goalie 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.489
 and so all types unless the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 of sally with surprise because to cuate 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.120
 previous world that began with the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 rabbit was going to be the title I do not like 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.520
 very much and really the Guillermo ochoa that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.000
 he was super annoying about that situation 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.720
 do you have a favorite of heart 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.370
 with an objective analysis of some 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.100
 because in this case one thing with the other 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.229
 and I'm staying with joseph jesus crown I think 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.310
 which it has been a goalkeeper and not of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.140
 less pressure on what he has done 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.340
 guillermo ochoa ni talavera but I think 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.110
 who has been a goalkeeper that in the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.570
 last three years has shown a great 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 regularity a safe goalkeeper under the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 three posts overcoming those issues 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.970
 extra aggressive court and you 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.700
 you will remember etcetera etcetera 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.950
 I think that Jesus of Jesus must do 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.390
 One week he tripped again and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.390
 he also went crazy 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.390
 I think based on regularity 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.430
 shown with josé manuel de la torre 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.460
 and then with all the technicians that 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.140
 They kept trusting or fulfilling 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.910
 the three posts for what he has shown 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.860
 in the security that has shown and in addition 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.080
 leadership I think it's going to be jose de 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.090
 jesus crown although yes if suddenly I 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.160
 appears well the Guillermo ochoa al 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.709
 contrary, good, good, because you 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.540
 you come in guard 7 that dart 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.659
 this adrenaline friends 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.299
 it occurs to me that whoever they put 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.939
 holder is going to be fair to do 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.280
 justice for any of the two and 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.439
 here do not put it will be unfair 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.239
 paradoxically incredible that is to say that 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.519
 you may be saying here that what 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.650
 He is kept before saying yes to me 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.180
 it seems to me not because the two are very 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.250
 good level now in my objective analysis 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.250
 because he let me go more than by the heart 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.300
 in this situation it seems to me that the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.870
 titular should be guillermo ochoa 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.819
 and beyond what I can believe for 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.999
 where it is shaping 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.980
 miguel herrera not but I think 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.780
 here we are watching performances I think 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.269
 what he faces or what he has 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.769
 faced in the last three years 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.629
 guillermo ochoa in his league has been 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.359
 greater difficulty than what 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.170
 faced and faced joseph de jesus 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.760
 crown and I insist the two seem to me 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.919
 extraordinary goalkeepers and I will be 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.209
 happy with either of the two but 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.129
 if I were in the coaching staff 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.139
 this would be the argument that I 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.180
 would present to miguel herrera or 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.680
 technical outside because surely that what 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.530
 is going to talk or has sat down with his 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840
 body and if to whom do we put why 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.750
 reasons what are the reasons within 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.419
 of the package as goalkeeper the two 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.870
 have deficiencies if both 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.250
 They present great qualities and I tell them 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.310
 both because we are already on one side to 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.560
 talavera the truth 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.290
 but I insist what he has faced 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.409
 guillermo ochoa 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.109
 to solve problems your team have 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.019
 been much bigger and more serious 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.310
 that what has made crown but teacher 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 now he has a better squad and a 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.579
 better definition do not you mean then 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.859
 to the subject also of the figures with the 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.140
 what I face, I really want that and what 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.150
 that you alone without having a good one to take out 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.650
 charges with the equipment has loaded more 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.510
 if the team the repository itself I 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.870
 added yes that's why I would give the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.879
 ownership see that it is a subject 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.799
 complicated but in the end I 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.650
 I see him like that, miguel in asia, sorry 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.720
 two parties in deciding it I think that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.060
 with drinks they have made me strong 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.250
 coalman should already be playing 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.440
 without the time despite the difficulty 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.259
 which is going to represent leaving one or two 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180
 in this case in banking it took a and 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.240
 radjen decide how the theme will be 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.729
 Well, I gave him information, but still not 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.070
 is going to be released except that out there 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.990
 there is an information leak but the 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.790
 topic where 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.700
 and to make it known is going to be up to 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.290
 Thursday, when Miguel Herrera announces 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.180
 of course the 11 holder and there 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.250
 we will know who will be the goalkeeper of 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.220
 the Mexican national team so there 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.660
 there is the theme of goalkeepers and if you 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.300
 it seems little friends we are going to listen 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.300
 words words of miguel herrera that 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.830
 already today because they had 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.420
 presence conference activity there 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.639
 in their training while encouraging 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.069
 hear 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.449
 a moment we saw that Spain lost the 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.389
 first match for being world champion 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.819
 and then that reflection because that's how 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.680
 suddenly they are not so bad that you lose 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.900
 if you have or not but in our case yes 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.659
 because the next second game is 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.330
 against Brazil and Brazil is local is the 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.770
 strongest team is favorite to win 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.050
 the world cup not just to be in 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.900
 the qualifying group then you will be 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.560
 would complicate more then there is that it opens up to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.139
 that strength will be known if we do not know 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.029
 I will try now to extend from 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.340
 writing will be strength and win the grace 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.330
 So the important thing is always 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.330
 start in the truth 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.500
 I see I do not know if because that's what it should be 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.990
 either because he thinks so or because he has 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.970
 to do it but I see a safe technician or 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.060
 he has gone forward we already know 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.190
 with miguel herrera but but I 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.930
 I would like to see what it is that really 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.900
 are you thinking if you are not worried or 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.229
 be me simply not having good 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.229
 defined who the goalkeeper I 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.940
 I have many doubts and I do not see it for sure 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.310
 make a good paper but if at the end of 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.860
 accounts then it is generated here because that's how 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.150
 Let her know Miguel Herrera in the 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.949
 moment in which the last three parties 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.780
 you have an alignment in each match 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.970
 different 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.470
 entry does not give you security class but 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.180
 I've listened to several former players in the 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.190
 case that we talked with nacho ambríz 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.789
 Querétaro technician and with my flowers 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.789
 both former World Cup and good 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.210
 participation both in the shade and 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:53.729
 wish that miguel you go you already know who 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.349
 is going to play on Friday without a doubt what 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.150
 what he is doing now is simply 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.009
 give others the opportunity to 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.780
 show but that miguel herrera already 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.770
 He knows perfectly well what would be worse 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.870
 so 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.990
 know who the players are not 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.419
 put them to practice or not know and be 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.720
 thinking about the selection I do not know 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:15.569
 if it's about the issue of seeking to protect 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.300
 take care of them that is difficult can not be 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.789
 difficult because I see a great 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.650
 insecurity to statements of 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:25.889
 Miguel Herrera who was sure 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.599
 what he said and did not worry was 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.310
 the chícharo hernández who spoke about the 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.729
 situation that had talked about the 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.960
 Cameroon selection with adrenaline
