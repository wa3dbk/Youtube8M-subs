00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
where are your classes I did a map that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.839

but it was sending my viewer and he

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.120 
but it was sending my viewer and he
meant<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.670> send<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.420> map<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.740> map<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
meant to send this map the map that the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
meant to send this map the map that the
other<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.939> he<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.300> sent<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.720> actually

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
other that he first sent was actually

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.130 
other that he first sent was actually
not<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> very<00:00:22.800> good<00:00:22.949> map<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.730> he<00:00:24.140> originally

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
not a very good map but he originally

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.929 
not a very good map but he originally
was<00:00:25.350> saying<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.920> he<00:00:26.039> wanted<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> send<00:00:26.760> this

was saying that he wanted to send this

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
was saying that he wanted to send this
map<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:28.170> he<00:00:28.289> thought<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.890> actually

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
map because he thought I would actually

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
map because he thought I would actually
like<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.640> supports<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.390> salt

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

for<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.190> flag<00:00:35.370> type<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.540> enemies<00:00:36.809> spawn<00:00:37.140> point

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
for a flag type so enemies spawn point

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
for a flag type so enemies spawn point
very<00:00:37.680> near<00:00:38.010> us<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.520> interesting

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
very near us that is very interesting

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
very near us that is very interesting
does<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.050> means<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> spawn

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
does that means that they can spawn

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
does that means that they can spawn
right<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.579> though<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.360> doing

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
right in here though they are not doing

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.799 
right in here though they are not doing
that<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.620> what's<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.809> we

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that so I don't know what's going on we

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.760 
that so I don't know what's going on we

what<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.160> immediately<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
what you can see immediately is that the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
what you can see immediately is that the
path<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.350> there's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> clear<00:01:04.979> path<00:01:05.339> with

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
path that it there's a clear path with

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
path that it there's a clear path with
all<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.500> other<00:01:07.500> spawn<00:01:07.770> points<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
all the other spawn points so it's a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
all the other spawn points so it's a
straight<00:01:09.090> line<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.409> cool<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
straight line so it's pretty cool you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
straight line so it's pretty cool you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
your squad if you are two clones if your

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
your squad if you are two clones if your
droids<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> defend<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:18.650> but<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
if the Walker you could of course use as

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
if the Walker you could of course use as
a<00:01:35.939> battering<00:01:36.329> ram<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.439> spawn<00:01:37.770> points<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
a battering ram and a spawn points and I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609 
a battering ram and a spawn points and I
don't<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.670> he<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.750> already<00:01:43.320> like

don't say he was right I do already like

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
don't say he was right I do already like
this<00:01:43.799> map<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.310> much<00:01:44.520> there's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:45.000> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this map very much there's a lot going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260 
this map very much there's a lot going
on<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.530> many<00:01:46.920> units<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
on I don't know how many units this is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.289 
on I don't know how many units this is
it<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.439> idea<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it I have the idea that actually a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
it I have the idea that actually a
sniper<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:52.470> decipher<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.280> helpful<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
sniper will decipher be very helpful I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.649 
sniper will decipher be very helpful I
don't<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> idea<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
don't think so I have the idea that it

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:05.200 
don't think so I have the idea that it
is<00:01:58.420> Excel<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.810> it<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.380> don't<00:02:01.009> know<00:02:01.100> maybe<00:02:04.210> not

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
is Excel is it I don't know maybe not

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.770 
is Excel is it I don't know maybe not
actually<00:02:05.420> maybe<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.229> regular<00:02:06.679> units<00:02:07.069> I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.729 

think<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.840> might<00:02:11.989> be<00:02:12.019> actually<00:02:12.230> regular<00:02:12.590> your

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
think it might be actually regular your

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.880 
think it might be actually regular your
regular<00:02:13.099> amount<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.340> units<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.330> because<00:02:15.170> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
regular amount of units but because it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.050 
regular amount of units but because it
is<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.069> straight<00:02:16.370> line<00:02:16.549> this<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.819> very

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
is a straight line this is very

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
is a straight line this is very
interesting<00:02:17.269> okay<00:02:18.110> fuck<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.560> enemy<00:02:19.220> sniper

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
interesting okay fuck the enemy sniper

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.330 
interesting okay fuck the enemy sniper
because<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> straight<00:02:21.019> line<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.860> focus

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
because it is a straight line the focus

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.660 
because it is a straight line the focus
of<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.580> battle<00:02:23.000> oh<00:02:23.239> god<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.080> lost<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.670> always

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
have for example multiple spawn points

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.479 
have for example multiple spawn points
in<00:02:34.849> other<00:02:35.510> maps<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.980> need<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.190> defend

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
in other maps that you need to defend

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.050 
in other maps that you need to defend
and<00:02:38.290> flank<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.560> blah<00:02:39.650> blah<00:02:39.680> here<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.849> don't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
and flank and blah blah here you don't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.300 
and flank and blah blah here you don't
have<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.709> since<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.799> go<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.069> chronological

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
have that since you go in chronological

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.970 
have that since you go in chronological
order<00:02:43.700> unless<00:02:44.299> unless<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:45.500> very<00:02:45.530> important

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
order unless unless it's very important

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.550 
order unless unless it's very important
you<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.430> Jedi<00:02:47.000> who<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.420> do<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.660> shit

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.780 

this<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.670> can<00:02:54.790> sprint<00:02:55.330> Oh<00:02:56.370> God

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this you can sprint Oh God

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.420 
this you can sprint Oh God
I<00:02:57.819> guess<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.599> could<00:02:58.720> also<00:02:58.900> take<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.620> team<00:03:00.130> of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
I guess you could also take a team of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.040 
I guess you could also take a team of
clones<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:01.090> group<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.420> clones<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.840> try<00:03:01.989> to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
clones a group of clones and try to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.199 
clones a group of clones and try to
flank<00:03:02.319> though<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.069> course<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.489> think<00:03:03.550> they<00:03:03.970> need

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
flank though of course I think they need

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.470 
flank though of course I think they need
to<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:06.010> at<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.400> end<00:03:06.550> -<00:03:08.069> yes<00:03:09.390> kind<00:03:10.390> of

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
to be more at the end - yes kind of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.650 
to be more at the end - yes kind of
protect<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> their<00:03:11.830> own<00:03:12.040> spawn<00:03:12.340> points<00:03:15.660> go

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
protect the their own spawn points go

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.140 
protect the their own spawn points go
away<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.900> with<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.170> Jedi<00:03:20.440> unit<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:22.000> can

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
away but with a Jedi unit you can

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.309 
away but with a Jedi unit you can
obviously<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> ton<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.680> damage<00:03:25.319> cross

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
obviously do a ton of damage cross

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.160 
obviously do a ton of damage cross
ground<00:03:26.680> very<00:03:27.489> very<00:03:28.299> quickly<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.870> get

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
ground very very quickly and now you get

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.830 
ground very very quickly and now you get
this<00:03:32.319> cool<00:03:32.620> dynamic<00:03:32.860> change<00:03:33.760> where<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.690> also

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
this cool dynamic change where we also

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.800 
this cool dynamic change where we also
attack<00:03:35.140> them<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.440> back<00:03:36.209> if<00:03:37.209> they<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.690> least

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
attack them in the back if they at least

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.080 
attack them in the back if they at least
would<00:03:38.080> spawn<00:03:38.440> over<00:03:38.650> here<00:03:40.980> which<00:03:41.980> they<00:03:42.220> are<00:03:42.790> not

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
would spawn over here which they are not

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.550 
would spawn over here which they are not
doing<00:03:44.670> now<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.900> eye<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.080> kind<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.410> interesting

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
doing now the eye is kind of interesting

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.390 
doing now the eye is kind of interesting
here<00:03:47.890> though<00:03:48.069> because<00:03:48.519> now<00:03:48.910> they<00:03:49.810> are

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
here though because now they are

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.840 
here though because now they are
attacking<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:54.400> spawn<00:03:54.819> point<00:03:55.060> over<00:03:55.209> there

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
attacking that spawn point over there

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.420 
attacking that spawn point over there
come<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.000> fucking<00:03:58.720> oh<00:03:59.220> Jesus

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
come on fucking oh Jesus

come on fucking oh Jesus
okay<00:04:01.000> I'm<00:04:01.690> gonna<00:04:01.870> die<00:04:02.019> yep

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.119 

I'm<00:04:06.620> gonna<00:04:06.739> see<00:04:07.010> if<00:04:07.159> I<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.430> spawn<00:04:07.879> over<00:04:08.090> here

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
I'm gonna see if I can spawn over here

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:17.050 
I'm gonna see if I can spawn over here
there's<00:04:10.129> a<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.430> think<00:04:10.730> yeah<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.000> droid<00:04:11.299> okay<00:04:16.060> well

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
there's a I think yeah I droid okay well

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.590 
there's a I think yeah I droid okay well
at<00:04:17.419> least<00:04:17.630> they<00:04:17.840> are<00:04:17.930> spawning<00:04:18.350> in<00:04:18.500> now<00:04:19.449> we<00:04:20.449> are

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
at least they are spawning in now we are

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.040 
at least they are spawning in now we are
in<00:04:20.720> front<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:22.479> guess<00:04:23.479> what<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.690> could<00:04:23.840> we<00:04:23.900> could

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
in front I guess what we could we could

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.460 
in front I guess what we could we could
be<00:04:24.169> cool<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.860> are<00:04:25.009> holding<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:27.139> spawn

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
be cool if you are holding the the spawn

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.550 
be cool if you are holding the the spawn
point<00:04:27.710> over<00:04:28.009> here<00:04:28.250> or<00:04:28.870> at<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> lower<00:04:30.169> end<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
point over here or at the lower end the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.110 
point over here or at the lower end the
spawn<00:04:30.770> point<00:04:31.009> one<00:04:31.160> what<00:04:31.639> would<00:04:31.789> be<00:04:31.850> cool<00:04:32.030> is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
spawn point one what would be cool is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.480 
spawn point one what would be cool is
you<00:04:32.389> need<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.870> hold<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:34.130> need<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.310> wait

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
you need to hold it and you need to wait

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.029 
you need to hold it and you need to wait
for<00:04:34.520> your<00:04:35.150> own<00:04:35.479> troops<00:04:35.900> in<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.199> north<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.830> come

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
for your own troops in the north to come

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.870 
for your own troops in the north to come
for<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:40.039> have<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.220> get<00:04:40.370> reinforced

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
for you and you have to get reinforced

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:53.510 
for you and you have to get reinforced
this<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.090> almost<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.539> Black<00:04:41.780> Hawk<00:04:41.990> Down<00:04:42.020> idea

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.960 

okay<00:04:54.389> ocean<00:04:55.139> ocean<00:05:01.220> no<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.340> are<00:05:02.460> losing<00:05:02.669> number

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
okay ocean ocean no we are losing number

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.730 
okay ocean ocean no we are losing number
two<00:05:03.120> again<00:05:05.720> so<00:05:06.720> yeah<00:05:06.870> definitely<00:05:07.199> a

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
two again so yeah definitely a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.770 
two again so yeah definitely a
recommendation<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.880> it's<00:05:09.000> been<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.360> while

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.550 

all<00:06:12.040> right<00:06:12.190> 15<00:06:12.639> left<00:06:12.820> we<00:06:13.030> are<00:06:13.300> we're<00:06:14.260> gonna<00:06:14.320> win

this<00:06:14.710> pretty<00:06:14.980> easily

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.210 

it's<00:06:22.780> interesting<00:06:23.260> though<00:06:23.530> that<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.740> just

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
it's interesting though that I just

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.980 
it's interesting though that I just
realized<00:06:24.639> this<00:06:24.790> that<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.120> droids<00:06:25.419> do<00:06:25.810> not

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
realized this that the droids do not

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.770 
realized this that the droids do not
have<00:06:26.260> vehicles<00:06:27.130> at<00:06:27.310> all<00:06:30.210> that<00:06:31.210> changes<00:06:31.630> things

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
have vehicles at all that changes things

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.430 
have vehicles at all that changes things
up<00:06:31.990> that<00:06:32.169> makes<00:06:32.380> them<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:32.860> wonder<00:06:33.790> if<00:06:33.910> that

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
up that makes them I wonder if that

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.110 
up that makes them I wonder if that
balances<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.590> since<00:06:35.830> if<00:06:36.040> we<00:06:36.340> had<00:06:36.460> one<00:06:36.760> Walker<00:06:37.000> I

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
balances it since if we had one Walker I

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.670 
balances it since if we had one Walker I
would<00:06:37.300> be<00:06:37.389> okay<00:06:37.690> but<00:06:37.870> we<00:06:37.900> have<00:06:38.020> speeders<00:06:38.350> also

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
would be okay but we have speeders also

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.500 
would be okay but we have speeders also
I<00:06:38.860> don't<00:06:38.919> know<00:06:39.100> if<00:06:39.220> that<00:06:39.340> if<00:06:39.490> that<00:06:39.610> does<00:06:39.850> but<00:06:40.300> I

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
I don't know if that if that does but I

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.670 
I don't know if that if that does but I
don't<00:06:41.500> know<00:06:42.750> maybe<00:06:43.750> there's<00:06:44.110> a<00:06:44.199> good<00:06:44.470> way

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
don't know maybe there's a good way

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.140 
don't know maybe there's a good way
strategically<00:06:45.610> for<00:06:45.820> them<00:06:45.940> to<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.870> play

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
strategically for them to to play

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.070 
strategically for them to to play
because<00:06:49.150> they<00:06:49.330> really<00:06:49.570> need<00:06:49.600> to<00:06:49.810> get<00:06:49.960> those

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
because they really need to get those

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.469 
because they really need to get those
kills<00:06:50.470> up<00:06:50.740> I<00:06:57.000> guess<00:06:58.000> you<00:06:58.090> know<00:06:58.210> throwing

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
kills up I guess you know throwing

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.879 
kills up I guess you know throwing
grenades<00:06:58.780> and<00:06:58.960> stuff<00:06:59.080> that<00:06:59.199> the<00:06:59.289> Walker<00:06:59.530> would

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
grenades and stuff that the Walker would

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.310 
grenades and stuff that the Walker would
be<00:07:00.039> kind<00:07:00.639> of<00:07:00.789> pointless<00:07:01.000> would<00:07:01.900> take<00:07:02.050> too<00:07:02.169> much

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
be kind of pointless would take too much

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.800 
be kind of pointless would take too much
time<00:07:02.970> you<00:07:03.970> need<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:04.150> focus<00:07:04.300> on<00:07:04.539> killing<00:07:04.750> us

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
time you need to focus on killing us

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.890 
time you need to focus on killing us
much<00:07:05.020> infantry<00:07:05.410> as<00:07:05.470> they<00:07:05.560> can<00:07:09.750> anyway<00:07:10.750> guys
