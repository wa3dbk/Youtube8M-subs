to<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> difference<00:00:26.070> between<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.310> les

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
to know the difference between right les

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670 
to know the difference between right les
is<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> problem<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.779> another<00:00:28.019> Mona<00:00:28.199> because

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
is the problem have another Mona because

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
is the problem have another Mona because
he's<00:00:28.859> getting<00:00:29.070> his<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.550> left<00:00:29.699> mixed<00:00:30.090> up
