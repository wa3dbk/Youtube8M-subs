most part the way I play for my play

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
most part the way I play for my play
style<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.330> love<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> fix<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.470> do<00:02:01.530> think

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
style I love to fix it and I do think

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
style I love to fix it and I do think
it's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.190> great<00:02:02.430> addition<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> game<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it's a great addition to the game and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.410 
it's a great addition to the game and
they<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.410> expand<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:06.270> try

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
they can probably expand on this to try

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
they can probably expand on this to try
to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.780> better<00:02:06.899> everything<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.500> always
