00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 but francesco i think every kind of every 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.179
 once in a while he took some 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.070
 decisions were the result of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 reflections not deep enough for 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.869
 which I think going a bit backwards when 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 he probably left in 2006 and not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.050
 I know if the truth I go by hypothesis can 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.940
 having thought that the most beautiful thing is that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.410
 you could win in football he had it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.480
 won that in the world and he was had 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
 faced this world after a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.940
 very serious injury for which 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 probably preferred as right 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.820
 which I think is in some cases 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.649
 dedicate a little more to the Rome and the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 their career their own health e 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.680
 trying to have a little less commitments 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 and maybe trying to optimize the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 work he did during the week 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 to be able to feel good and could provide 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.600
 performance up to the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 own team 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 and it is clear that in 2006 it was 30 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 francesco years for which it was no longer 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 not even so young maybe he had 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.000
 thought the time had come 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.350
 right here to say goodbye though 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.979
 in short, seeing that seven have passed 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.979
 years and how it is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.780
 and it is clear that he is a bit disappointed though 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.540
 probably it is so maybe it is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.159
 because he succeeded in these seven years a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.430
 work in a certain way that he has 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:47.460
 therefore allowed to last so long 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:50.100
 these are personal speeches and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.049
 intimate because the end when there 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.460
 we meet often we talk about many 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.080
 things in short that he knows that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.370
 that we tell ourselves 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.600
 the locker room in quotes not for 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.060
 what concerns the decisions here of 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.850
 a coach should not say anything in the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.980
 meaning that they are specific responsibilities 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.600
 who guides the team and who thinks 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.300
 to do the good of the team in sight 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.480
 of a competition 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.530
 if in the specific case we speak of a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.120
 boy like francesco francesco is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:40.090
 still today one of the national team because 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.770
 because with some of us he shared 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.420
 kind with me since under 15 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.630
 this kind of this kind of adventure 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.060
 and for me it will always be mine 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.940
 national teammate 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.450
 if then a player like him with his 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.920
 his talent his caliber with his 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.220
 class 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.830
 keep playing on the levels 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.340
 formidable here are those of this year 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.930
 I think the coach's answer is there 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.239
 a very clever answer in the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.480
 sense that it is right not to preclude anything 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.010
 to 1 with which really can do the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.320
 difference and can win 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.209
 start but I think it's a speech 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.610
 very very logical towards a 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:33.640
 boy who is writing the 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:38.230
 history of Italian football and is 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.510
 writing with with the present and maybe 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.890
 not even with a near future here 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.450
 they have the writing we are not talking about 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.450
 just to pass it
