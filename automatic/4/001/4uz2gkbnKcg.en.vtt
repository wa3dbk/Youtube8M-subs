00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.870
 carlos aladro venezuela.com has not 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.900
 passed that the phone is suddenly 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 falls into the golden video in the hands or in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.870
 any container with water but 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'll tell you what to do next 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.320
 let's start what to do when the phone 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.630
 you fall on the heliodoro in your hand in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 any container with water following 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 if these simple steps these simple 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 steps to get it out to rescue them for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.820
 come back to life the demonstration amos is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.820
 how they use their thanks to three 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.950
 the demonstration we are going to do with a 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.410
 blackberry with 85 20 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.340
 So what do we do if we drop the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.340
 phone to the cta 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.350
 Step 1 immediately remove the phone 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.860
 of the liquid 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.480
 step 2 end decanting to touch the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.610
 buttons and see if the phone works 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.860
 I recite that the buttons are at risk 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.200
 that well between more water more liquid in 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.370
 the telephone and the telephone of years passed 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.550
 3 immediately remove the entire cover 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.880
 protective fourth hour of the phone 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.860
 fourth immediately removes the battery 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.600
 of the team if all kinds of obstacles 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.090
 internal battery not removable as a 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.330
 Nokia n8 air with a phone or 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.220
 htc you have to take a chance and turn off the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.759
 phone manually this is 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.259
 mainly because when cutting the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.759
 circuits developed circuits both 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.930
 removing the battery as turning off the 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.520
 equipment is minimized the entire risk that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.920
 the equipment short-circuits in a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 fifth remove the card without a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.290
 microsd card and any other card 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 or telephone peripheral this allows 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.100
 that with open ports can 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.650
 enter more air and dry more radios 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 I know what's left of moisture with a 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.299
 towel be exhaustive with the ports 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.759
 especially the ports of promotion was 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.040
 stacks of card sim cards 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.619
 sd and any contact you have left 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.750
 exposed even when everything is dry can 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.300
 that there is a little moisture inside the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 phone all is recommended that we 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.940
 keep it has already gotten into rice committed 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.010
 in silica sachets or any 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.620
 moisture-absorbing material store it 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 in that container for 24 or 48 hours 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.020
 and the phone will be perfect 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.940
 terms 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 after 48 hours you can turn on 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.870
 the phone with total confidence you 're going to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.150
 have what perfect conditions that yes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.010
 under no circumstances use 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 dryers or any other source of 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.280
 heat the heat can finish damage from 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.069
 the components the team either 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.230
 try to freeze the phone and put it to 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.180
 cold extremes although the water loses 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
 electrical qualities like cold 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 eventually the water will melt and 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.519
 the water will also be in the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.670
 phone and the damage that can be 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.190
 cause of moisture comfort 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.910
