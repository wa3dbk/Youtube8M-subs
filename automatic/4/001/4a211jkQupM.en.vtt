00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.679
 arrives at 8 years or so when 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.329
 my uncles lived with studies no longer 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.189
 they wanted me to be nothing but funny 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.169
 in the house and I enrolled to be a sport 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.570
 there was a little field two blocks from the 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.670
 home and that's where the football started, the truth is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.760
 I did not want I did not want I was not very very 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.829
 very encouraged in that but that's how he was born and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.210
 since eight years eight years and 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 half started playing football and to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.480
 date 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.880
 but the truth is that it was something I say 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.860
 obviously he behaved to the hundreds of 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.230
 monterrey but in first division was 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.820
 something now it is very spontaneous 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.040
 part of the old 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.800
 already being in the full stadium I 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.560
 also with the talk list tells me how 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.120
 you feel good you want to play if it was not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.460
 I who was going to be the owner was going to be 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.260
 Christian the same you will not play and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.270
 change everything in that moment and my mind 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.470
 imagine, I think it made me good 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.290
 because if it had been up all night 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.860
 thinking thinking thinking and this and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.030
 good we had to debut 13 August 2005 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.030
 against the atlas in fact 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.070
 the truth is that very grateful to God 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.800
 I have done very well I worked very hard 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 to be where we are obviously 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.370
 one aspires more things and I would like to continue 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.280
 being more more achievements but I feel myself 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.870
 I feel very good I feel very very very 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.160
 quiet with what I've done so far 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.160
 but with aspirations of more 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.149
 obviously I need to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.670
 start that riding I start to win 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.060
 come out let's get out of this streak that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.620
 has touched us and then I believe that the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.629
 greater achievement the greater I do not know greater greater 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.810
 challenge that we have as a player is the 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.920
 selection has always been in my mind 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.090
 is in the selection obviously I know that 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.250
 it's difficult because there are great archers 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.019
 in Mexico but I do not lose the illusion and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.769
 I lose the fact of continuing to work 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.769
 for some day be there 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.740
 I say I have several obviously one of my 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.490
 idols is the confiscation that was the one that 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.080
 it did touch now that initial soccer 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.780
 when he read he started to take it, he went 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.030
 by confiscation but obviously the most 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.340
 marked and what the idea that I like so 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.590
 is the bravia fields that is also 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.330
 bursting all this time but fields 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.660
 was the one that came to revolutionize the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660
 portalina 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.110
 notice that something started very as if nothing 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.960
 I feel like a suit at the bar one day 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.390
 kid of fact this cross mission and 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.100
 there began the taste the truth is that no 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.780
 paras you like one and you like or you 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.630
 start to see more and more and more and more and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 more and you start to nail this and what 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.870
 it started as supposedly a single 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.930
 tattoo ended up being more than 100 that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.480
 I have this list but it was a pleasure 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.310
 it is a form of expression every tattoo 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.440
 expresses something something that touches me 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.660
 live something what has touched me this 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.820
 some teaching something for my children 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.130
 something for my wife something for the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.630
 football life itself and I 've 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.970
 tried to translate in some way what 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.790
 better others like pital we like 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.380
 do other kinds of things and hobbies I do 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.580
 I wanted to translate into a tattoo that 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.200
 truth for me is very significant 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.380
 and that I know I'm going to take all the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.380
 lifetime 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.840
