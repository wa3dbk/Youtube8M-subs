most<00:01:45.590> useful<00:01:45.709> you<00:01:46.280> could<00:01:46.429> use<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.729> pretty<00:01:46.880> much

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
most useful you could use it pretty much

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.340 
most useful you could use it pretty much
anywhere<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.659> game<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:47.869> mean<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.170> have<00:01:48.289> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
anywhere in the game I mean you have to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
anywhere in the game I mean you have to
look<00:01:48.500> out<00:01:48.649> for<00:01:48.830> things<00:01:48.979> like<00:01:49.129> blindness<00:01:49.789> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
look out for things like blindness and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.460 
look out for things like blindness and
blocking<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.629> all<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.929> good<00:01:51.140> stuff<00:01:51.200> but

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
blocking and all that good stuff but

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.559 
blocking and all that good stuff but
hard<00:01:52.190> mode<00:01:52.369> especially<00:01:52.610> because<00:01:53.269> in<00:01:53.390> normal

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
hard mode especially because in normal

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.059 
hard mode especially because in normal

many skills off as you possibly could

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.779 
many skills off as you possibly could
just<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.379> you<00:01:57.500> kill<00:01:57.800> them<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.190> fast<00:01:58.580> with

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
just because you kill them so fast with

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.550 
just because you kill them so fast with
this<00:01:58.910> build<00:01:59.209> so<00:01:59.330> hard<00:02:00.170> mode<00:02:00.379> especially

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
this build so hard mode especially

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.050 
this build so hard mode especially
vanquishing<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.580> could<00:02:01.729> see<00:02:01.879> this<00:02:02.000> being

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
vanquishing I could see this being

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.270 
vanquishing I could see this being
especially<00:02:02.569> useful<00:02:03.229> maybe<00:02:03.530> elite<00:02:03.920> areas

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
especially useful maybe elite areas

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.650 
especially useful maybe elite areas
maybe<00:02:04.610> I'll<00:02:04.759> see<00:02:04.940> someone<00:02:05.269> create<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.539> new

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
maybe I'll see someone create a new
