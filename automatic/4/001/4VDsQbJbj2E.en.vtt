00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:21.520
 The point is that it is a problem with participle syntax 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:25.560
 First of all , let's review the complete participle syntax as a premise to solve this problem 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 Joining participle syntax is Habing bullet 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.430
 Starting in this way 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:39.740
 Sb of subject and predicate verb after that will continue to lead off until now 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:43.790
 The point here is always the subject of Atoru sentence 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.410
 This part shows the distance to the front also teeth bing bullet 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 What 's the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.190
 That's where the relationship is organized 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.190
 This time the night before 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:02.589
 Apparently called the previous burn 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.150
 Because the past called the road words round has an expression that represents the last distance 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.570
 I understand that I use the complete molecule workshop 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.570
 Stand Then, the first No. 4 not been completed participle syntax 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.370
 Since the summer looks anyone out for a moment, but has become a stool Re India is passive voice 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.560
 This is also a cross 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.960
 The point is that using No. 2 tree part bing group's complete participle syntax 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.680
 We now have 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.400
 However, the subject of this case If you were if No. 2 is correct, as was earlier confirmed and s after 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 It becomes after 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.160
 In other words , if the turn is the correct answer to death already, the subject of the leaf Binglein will be The Road 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.160
 is 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 This also means you do not have any form because indeed the road was raining 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:58.530
 So the second answer to Kojima will make the correct market 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.270
 Here is the forced Dorsie's leaf Binglein's it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.250
 This it has become one animal representing health 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.470
 Because the whole sentence had rained the night before 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.270
 The road was muddy 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.890
 The current problem is the rear to the attention First of all completed minute to the right before 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.620
 See through 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.860
 Furthermore, it differs from the subject of later sentences 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.350
 Please be aware that there is a thread of semantic subject 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.380
 I'll divide it into two minutes and check again 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.720

 Then the road east Li road was muddy 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.580
 Originally, the subject is different because we think from these two sentences 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.860

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.569
 hard rain degree of Ha Bingure the leaves which India head here in the past completed 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.650

 You can think of it as transformed to this perfect participle syntax 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:17.380

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:21.580
 Please think slowly 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:26.970
