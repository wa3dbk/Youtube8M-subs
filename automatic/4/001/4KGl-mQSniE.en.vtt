00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.820
 when Jesus is taken to be 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.870
 circumcised to the eighth day and receives the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.060
 name 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.289
 Your name is savior we have here a 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:26.449
 singular moment in which god made people 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 subject to the requirement to be 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.690
 circumcised as a Jewish boy and this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 is a vision that today was a ceremony 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 simply must have lasted ten minutes at the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 maximum 15 minutes but it was something 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.210
 awesome for once 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 from the point of view where we 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.780
 we find today because maybe in that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 time not everyone noticed his 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.340
 meaning 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 there we have God himself made man 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 subject to being mutilated because it is 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.110
 mutilation by being subjected to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.979
 mutilated and occupying the place of the sinner and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 all for the sake of those he came 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.840
 rescue but there are more things here 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 when Jesus is circumcised he then becomes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 makes it obligatory to comply with all the law 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.030
 because circumcision was the symbol of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.909
 all that system of laws 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 at the time that Jesus is circumcised and he 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 becomes officially Jewish and as such he 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.759
 if he places himself under the law he is obliged 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.680
 then to keep by law 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.590
 This is what Paul said in Galatians. 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.079
 chapter 5 verse 3 who who circumcised 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.649
 is required to keep the entire law 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 then Jesus there submits himself to the law there 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.470
 is placed under the law as Paul says 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 there in Galatians chapter 4 verse 4 that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 in the fulness of time god sent his 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.229
 son born of a woman and born 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.960
 under the law to rescue those who 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.660
 were under the law the law of God 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720
 although it was given to the Jews 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.710
 it has a global reach because 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.840
 the requirements 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.180
 God not only because they are not only 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.700
 for the descendants of Abraham does not 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 you will not adulterate 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.980
 you will die evil is false testimony honor 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.050
 your father and your mother did not covet the area 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 from your neighbor you will have no other gods 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.160
 in front of me is not part of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.690
 you will not take my name in vain 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.870
 remembers the day of rest for 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.190
 sanctify these laws are valid for the world 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.480
 everything for every person that comes to the world 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.760
 so jesus and and these laws they took the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.740
 substance in the law of moses they are 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.400
 written in the law of Moses when Jesus 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.230
 he is born a Jew he is born officially 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.350
 under the law with obligation to keep 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.720
 the law but it does so with a goal 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.260
 to rescue all who are underneath 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.960
 of the law not only Jews but also the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 Gentiles like you and how can you 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.170
 ask but what 's underneath 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.570
 of law 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.390
 it was not god who gave the law was not god 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.180
 which revealed whether the moses and the nation of 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.660
 israel and gave his law that he is just holy 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 and good the problem is not the law 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.940
 are we if we were not sinners 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.700
 would a blessing be under the law 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.100
 because of course we would not kill 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.590
 we would not save, we will not start the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.230
 things of the neighbor did not lie we were going 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.960
 we would only worship God then it would be 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.670
 a wonder is under the law if we 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.490
 we would not have sinned if we had not 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.280
 we were inclined by nature to break 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.400
 each of the precepts of this law 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 our natural inclination is to break 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.070
 this law every one of its precepts 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 That's why it's no advantage to us. 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.180
 live under the law because the law will 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.180
 to reveal our sin 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.740
 the law will characterize us as 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.980
 transgressors and the law will require that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.400
 we pay at the price of having 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.310
 disobeyed God and the price and 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.190
 condemnation and eternal suffering before 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.190
 God is not an advantage, is not it? 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.669
 good is under this law and the Jews 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.590
 suffered so much is that the law itself 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.570
 she already had the escape 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.270
 if you do these things you want 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.360
 these commandments and will be killed but there 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.220
 she herself said if you are 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.340
 sorry if you confess your 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.560
 sins you can bring an animal that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.620
 will be sacrificed at the altar by the 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.320
 priest and the life of that animal goes 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.800
 pay for his blood that he spills 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.810
 God says I'll take it in exchange for your 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.449
 blood of your life the very law of 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.250
 moses already had provision for 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.150
 sinners bring a system of 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.100
 sacrifice in which the lives of animals 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.169
 would replace the Jew's life 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.260
 he had to live offering the 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.460
 sacrifices because he could not 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.080
 obey the law 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.960
 and these sacrifices were to be made 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.330
 which proves that the law does not 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.979
 perfected no one because every day 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.410
 had a sacrifice every day had 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:27.250
 sin was not an advantage why the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.979
 son of god is born under the law 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.810
 he becomes bound to keep all law 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.660
 and he is born under her to rescue 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.000
 those who are under the law to 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.280
 rescue you and me we are 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.990
 under this law and we can not fulfill 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.510
 we could not get there 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.729
 we are condemned for it we are 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.570
 framed as transgressors and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:56.590
 placed under the righteous wrath of God 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.380
 he was circumcised then to be 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.169
 obliged to keep all laws to be 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.360
 placed under the law and to faint 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.229
 one thing about this in Galatians 3 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.919
 13 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.470
 it became an audition for us because 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:16.240
 it is written in the cursed law all that 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:19.389
 that is hung on the tree so that 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.599
 Jesus could become a curse for us 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:28.180
 and take the punishment we deserve 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.840
 being made cursed of God in our 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.300
 place 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.510
 he must have been born under the law 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.000
 which says that everyone who is hung 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.039
 on a cross is god damn 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.300
 This is a law that we find there in the 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.849
 Old testment 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.379
 in which it was said that whoever died 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.520
 suspended 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:50.889
 had to be taken from the cross take the 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.770
 where it was hung because it is 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.800
 damn god then already in the old 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.500
 testament the law cursed whoever 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.270
 hanging died hanging on a cross 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.879
 that's why he was born under the law 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.479
 so that it could become a curse on 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:11.520
 our place for him to take on 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.520
 if the curse that was upon us
