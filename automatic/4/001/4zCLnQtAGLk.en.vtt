00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
hey friends this is 2000 ml sorry 20 and

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.440 
hey friends this is 2000 ml sorry 20 and
let's<00:00:06.359> look<00:00:06.750> together<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:08.309> reset<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
let's look together how we can reset the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.680 
let's look together how we can reset the
service<00:00:10.019> slide<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.830> vehicle<00:00:11.480> but<00:00:12.480> you

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
service slide on this vehicle but you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.950 
service slide on this vehicle but you
know<00:00:12.870> what<00:00:13.309> let's<00:00:14.309> first<00:00:14.730> get<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.509> little<00:00:15.809> bit

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
know what let's first get a little bit

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
know what let's first get a little bit
educated<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.310> system<00:00:17.699> works<00:00:19.400> Mercedes

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
educated how this system works Mercedes

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.009 
educated how this system works Mercedes
Benz<00:00:20.760> calls<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:22.279> service<00:00:23.279> system<00:00:24.019> flexible

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
Benz calls this service system flexible

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.660 
Benz calls this service system flexible
service<00:00:25.680> system<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.050> why<00:00:28.670> generally

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
service system and this is why generally

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.130 
service system and this is why generally
the<00:00:30.510> interval<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> set<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.920> 10000<00:00:32.669> miles

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
the interval is set up for 10000 miles

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
the interval is set up for 10000 miles
but<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.649> computer<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> vehicle<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
but if the computer of the vehicle is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.470 
but if the computer of the vehicle is
reading<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:38.010> driving<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:39.120> short

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
reading that you are driving very short

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
reading that you are driving very short
trips<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.620> engine<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.160> warm<00:00:41.700> up

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
trips when the engine is not warm up

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
trips when the engine is not warm up
enough<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.190> fast<00:00:44.870> driving<00:00:46.039> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
enough or it's a very fast driving that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.990 
enough or it's a very fast driving that
interval<00:00:47.760> might<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.660> shorter<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.760> let's<00:00:50.760> go

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
interval might be shorter so let's go

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.470 
interval might be shorter so let's go
and<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.660> together<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:54.420> many

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and see together how we can see how many

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.340 
and see together how we can see how many
miles<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.440> remaining<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> next<00:00:56.670> service

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
miles are remaining to the next service

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.599 
miles are remaining to the next service
so<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.399> ahead<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.090> put<00:01:00.449> ignition<00:01:01.379> on

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
so I will go ahead and put ignition on

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.490 
so I will go ahead and put ignition on
and<00:01:02.930> where<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.460> service<00:01:05.570> reminder<00:01:06.570> number

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and where is my service reminder number

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.630 
and where is my service reminder number
it's<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.299> displayed<00:01:10.189> these<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.460> only

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's not there displayed these are only

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.140 
it's not there displayed these are only
the<00:01:11.820> miles<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.900> push<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.500> button

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the miles and if I push this button

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
the miles and if I push this button
there's<00:01:15.150> nothing<00:01:15.270> happening<00:01:16.110> let's<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.340> how

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
there's nothing happening let's see how

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480 
there's nothing happening let's see how
we<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:19.250> information<00:01:20.250> wasn't

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
we will do it information wasn't

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.609 
we will do it information wasn't
displayed<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.070> displayed<00:01:23.670> only

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
displayed because it is displayed only

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
displayed because it is displayed only
2,000<00:01:25.619> miles<00:01:26.720> before<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.439> service<00:01:29.390> intervals

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
2,000 miles before the service intervals

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.800 
2,000 miles before the service intervals
expire<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.369> obviously<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:33.299> but

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
expire so we have obviously more but

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.719 
expire so we have obviously more but
what<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.920> recall<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> putting

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
what I can do I can recall it putting

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.300 
what I can do I can recall it putting
key<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> ignition<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
key in the ignition going to the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.319 
key in the ignition going to the
position<00:01:38.909> 2<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> pushing<00:01:40.400> twice<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.850> button

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
position 2 and pushing twice this button

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.889 
position 2 and pushing twice this button
1<00:01:42.570> 2<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
1 2 and you can see there there is the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.859 
1 2 and you can see there there is the
service<00:01:46.350> interval<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.220> still<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.970> 4,200

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
service interval I still have 4,200

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.219 
service interval I still have 4,200
miles<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> next<00:01:50.369> service<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.450> finally<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
miles to the next service and finally I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
miles to the next service and finally I
will<00:01:52.290> show<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.240> reset<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.450> service

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
will show you how to reset that service

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.039 
will show you how to reset that service
slide<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> act<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.329> quickly

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
slide you have to act really quickly

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.340 
slide you have to act really quickly
otherwise<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.310> miss<00:01:59.670> these<00:02:00.479> limits

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
otherwise you will miss these limits

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.730 
otherwise you will miss these limits
time<00:02:01.920> limits<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.750> put<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> key<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
time limits so you put a key in the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.609 
time limits so you put a key in the
ignition<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:06.000> turn<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> position

will show you your mileage remain

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.509 
will show you your mileage remain
you<00:02:14.299> go<00:02:14.510> immediately<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.499> the<00:02:15.739> zero<00:02:16.159> who's

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
you go immediately in the zero who's

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.789 
you go immediately in the zero who's
this<00:02:16.790> button<00:02:17.269> again<00:02:17.689> and<00:02:17.870> immediately<00:02:18.530> put

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
this button again and immediately put

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.119 
this button again and immediately put
number<00:02:19.219> two<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.760> after<00:02:20.859> approximately<00:02:21.859> 10

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
number two and after approximately 10

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.660 
number two and after approximately 10
seconds<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:23.749> will<00:02:23.989> beep<00:02:24.499> and<00:02:24.769> put<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
seconds the thing will beep and put it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.809 
seconds the thing will beep and put it
in<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.999> 10,000<00:02:26.930> miles<00:02:27.139> interval<00:02:27.889> that<00:02:28.159> means

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
in the 10,000 miles interval that means

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.490 
in the 10,000 miles interval that means
it<00:02:29.329> did<00:02:29.780> reset<00:02:30.469> you<00:02:31.069> just<00:02:31.370> heard<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:31.819> beep<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it did reset you just heard a beep and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.349 
it did reset you just heard a beep and
that's<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.739> way<00:02:33.889> how<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.250> works<00:02:34.519> if<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.969> do<00:02:35.180> it

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
that's the way how it works if you do it

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.349 
that's the way how it works if you do it
a<00:02:35.569> little<00:02:35.930> bit<00:02:36.170> slower<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:37.459> will<00:02:37.670> always<00:02:38.090> miss
