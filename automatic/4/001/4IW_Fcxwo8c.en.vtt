00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and it looks like actually really good

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.770 
and it looks like actually really good
it<00:02:08.580> does<00:02:08.729> bring<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> quality<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> little

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it does bring down the quality a little

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.870 
it does bring down the quality a little
bit<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> still<00:02:11.039> looks<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bit but it still looks pretty good and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.820 
bit but it still looks pretty good and
for<00:02:12.239> some<00:02:12.390> reason<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> cuts<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.260> audio<00:02:13.650> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
for some reason it cuts out the audio so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.199 
for some reason it cuts out the audio so
you're<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.550> super<00:02:14.819> cool

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
you're not going to get that super cool

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're not going to get that super cool
rule<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.989> sound<00:02:16.349> when<00:02:16.500> you're<00:02:16.590> doing<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
rule or sound when you're doing the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.070 
rule or sound when you're doing the
slo-mo<00:02:17.280> effects<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.569> still<00:02:18.750> looks<00:02:18.930> great

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
slo-mo effects but it still looks great

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.960 
slo-mo effects but it still looks great
another<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.040> fisheye<00:02:20.430> effect<00:02:20.459> which

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970

reflects<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.799> camera<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.909> audio

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
reflects on the camera and the audio

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.460 
reflects on the camera and the audio
sounds<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.569> lot<00:04:12.690> better<00:04:12.870> now<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.230> I'm<00:04:13.319> inside

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
sounds a lot better now that I'm inside

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.670 
sounds a lot better now that I'm inside

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.350 
the iPad iPhone cuz I'm such a fan boy
as<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.039> can<00:04:27.160> see<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.520> camera<00:04:27.759> is<00:04:27.970> also

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
as you can see this camera is also

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.120 
as you can see this camera is also
really<00:04:28.750> good<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:29.169> low<00:04:29.470> lighting<00:04:29.770> situations

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
really good in low lighting situations

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.550 
really good in low lighting situations
so<00:04:30.669> if<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:30.970> kind<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.210> dark<00:04:31.449> outside<00:04:31.960> or<00:04:32.350> if

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so if it's kind of dark outside or if

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.930 
so if it's kind of dark outside or if
you're<00:04:32.710> in<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.860> darker<00:04:33.250> room<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.699> you<00:04:33.759> don't

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
you're in a darker room and you don't

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.969 
you're in a darker room and you don't
have<00:04:34.060> great<00:04:34.240> lighting<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.259> still<00:04:35.500> records

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
have great lighting and it still records

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.279 
have great lighting and it still records
really<00:04:36.759> nice<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.240> kind<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.780> brightens<00:04:38.169> things

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
really nice and kind of brightens things

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.499 
really nice and kind of brightens things
up<00:04:38.710> again<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.460> five<00:04:39.699> times<00:04:39.729> optical<00:04:40.479> zoom

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
up again it is five times optical zoom

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.390 
up again it is five times optical zoom
when<00:04:41.320> you're<00:04:41.410> taking<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.740> picture<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.250> does

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
when you're taking a picture it does

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.830 
when you're taking a picture it does
zoom<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.759> pretty<00:04:43.030> fast<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:43.570> when<00:04:43.720> you're

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
zoom in pretty fast but when you're

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.540 
zoom in pretty fast but when you're
recording<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.259> video<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.770> kind<00:04:45.070> of<00:04:45.130> zooms<00:04:45.340> in<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
recording a video it kind of zooms in a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.460 
recording a video it kind of zooms in a
little<00:04:45.729> bit<00:04:45.820> slower<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.449> does<00:04:46.660> autofocus

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
little bit slower but it does autofocus

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.960 
little bit slower but it does autofocus
at<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.770> same<00:04:47.949> time<00:04:48.190> while<00:04:48.370> you're<00:04:48.490> zooming<00:04:48.789> in

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
at the same time while you're zooming in

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.790 
at the same time while you're zooming in
so<00:04:49.570> that's<00:04:49.750> actually<00:04:49.960> really<00:04:50.139> good<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.740> it

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
so that's actually really good and it

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.050 
so that's actually really good and it
works<00:04:50.919> really<00:04:51.160> well<00:04:51.280> now<00:04:51.729> this<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:51.940> a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
works really well now this is a

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.760 
works really well now this is a
point-and-shoot<00:04:52.570> power<00:04:52.900> shot<00:04:53.229> camera<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:53.710> you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
point-and-shoot power shot camera so you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.870 
point-and-shoot power shot camera so you
do<00:04:53.919> want<00:04:54.130> this<00:04:54.220> thing<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.520> take<00:04:54.639> great

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
do want this thing to take great

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.820 
do want this thing to take great
pictures<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.720> does<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:55.990> pretty<00:04:56.289> good<00:04:56.380> job<00:04:56.530> at

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
pictures it does a pretty good job at

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.740 
pictures it does a pretty good job at
pictures<00:04:57.190> there's<00:04:57.460> obviously<00:04:57.940> better

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
pictures there's obviously better

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.110 
pictures there's obviously better
cameras<00:04:59.199> out<00:04:59.380> there<00:04:59.650> for<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.520> price<00:05:00.729> but<00:05:00.970> they

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
cameras out there for the price but they

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.159 
cameras out there for the price but they
are<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.449> end<00:05:01.630> up<00:05:01.690> being<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.930> little<00:05:01.990> bit

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
are going to end up being a little bit

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.480 
are going to end up being a little bit
bigger<00:05:02.380> but<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.800> camera<00:05:03.039> I<00:05:03.160> think

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
bigger but this camera I think

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.700 
bigger but this camera I think
specializes<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.240> video<00:05:04.389> but<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.229> pictures<00:05:05.530> do

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
specializes in video but the pictures do

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.110 
specializes in video but the pictures do
look<00:05:05.919> pretty<00:05:06.099> good<00:05:06.280> as<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.669> can<00:05:06.789> see<00:05:06.940> right

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
look pretty good as you can see right

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.210 
look pretty good as you can see right
here<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.840> can't<00:05:08.289> give<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.650> best<00:05:08.830> picture

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
here I can't give you the best picture

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.279 
here I can't give you the best picture
possible<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.000> video<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:10.539> that<00:05:10.930> does<00:05:11.110> take

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
possible in the video but that does take

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.629 
possible in the video but that does take
great<00:05:11.470> pictures<00:05:11.650> it's<00:05:12.070> going<00:05:12.250> to<00:05:12.310> do<00:05:12.400> just

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
great pictures it's going to do just

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:13.860 
great pictures it's going to do just
fine<00:05:12.789> for<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.060> I'm<00:05:13.240> pretty<00:05:13.419> sure<00:05:13.599> you<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:13.810> be

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
fine for you I'm pretty sure you can be

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.719 
fine for you I'm pretty sure you can be
satisfied<00:05:14.080> with<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.680> but<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.280> think<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.580> main

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
satisfied with it but I think the main

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.310 
satisfied with it but I think the main
selling<00:05:15.970> point<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:16.449> camera<00:05:16.660> is<00:05:16.900> just<00:05:17.199> the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
selling point of this camera is just the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.529 
selling point of this camera is just the
1080p<00:05:17.830> video<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:18.250> how<00:05:18.340> well<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.820> looks<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
1080p video and how well it looks the

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.700 
1080p video and how well it looks the
battery<00:05:19.840> life<00:05:19.990> unless<00:05:20.139> camera<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.560> actually

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
battery life unless camera is actually

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.040 
battery life unless camera is actually
really<00:05:21.070> good<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.699> use<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.360> again<00:05:22.479> in<00:05:22.780> my<00:05:22.870> daily

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
really good I use it again in my daily

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.810 
really good I use it again in my daily
videos<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.770> use<00:05:23.889> it<00:05:24.010> pretty<00:05:24.160> much<00:05:24.310> all<00:05:24.580> day

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
videos and use it pretty much all day

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.000 
videos and use it pretty much all day
and<00:05:24.880> it<00:05:25.090> lasts<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.870> sometimes<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.650> does<00:05:26.800> run

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
and it lasts and sometimes it does run

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.680 
and it lasts and sometimes it does run
out<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.400> I'm<00:05:27.520> recording<00:05:28.030> video<00:05:28.300> all<00:05:28.449> day<00:05:28.630> so

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
out but I'm recording video all day so

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.180 
out but I'm recording video all day so
obviously<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.500> best<00:05:29.710> kind<00:05:29.919> of<00:05:29.979> drained

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
obviously the best kind of drained

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.500 
obviously the best kind of drained
battery<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.520> lot<00:05:30.699> faster<00:05:31.060> than<00:05:31.240> if<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.419> were

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
battery a lot faster than if you were

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.120 
battery a lot faster than if you were
taking<00:05:31.810> pictures<00:05:31.930> bored<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.530> did<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.830> make<00:05:32.949> up

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130

is just so much smaller and does way
better<00:06:19.120> video<00:06:19.570> than<00:06:20.169> like<00:06:20.860> flip<00:06:21.099> cameras<00:06:21.490> or

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639

any other flogging cameras out there I

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.350 
any other flogging cameras out there I
think<00:06:23.680> it's<00:06:23.950> just<00:06:24.130> amazing<00:06:24.729> if<00:06:25.090> you're<00:06:25.240> doing

tech videos like me it's a pretty good
hammer<00:06:27.500> because<00:06:27.740> it<00:06:27.920> does<00:06:28.070> have<00:06:28.250> autofocus

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
hammer because it does have autofocus

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.200 
and everything but at the same time it
is<00:06:30.950> kind<00:06:31.190> of<00:06:31.250> annoying<00:06:31.460> if<00:06:31.730> you<00:06:31.820> want<00:06:32.000> to<00:06:32.090> get
