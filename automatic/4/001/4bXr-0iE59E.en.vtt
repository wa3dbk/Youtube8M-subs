fascination with it as well this is

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.370 
fascination with it as well this is
certainly<00:04:08.310> not<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.940> film<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.600> was<00:04:09.750> made<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.200> be

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
certainly not a film that was made to be

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.920 
certainly not a film that was made to be
a<00:04:10.410> hint<00:04:10.920> or<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.250> moneymaker<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.360> very<00:04:12.630> much

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
a hint or a moneymaker it is very much

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.160 
a hint or a moneymaker it is very much
an<00:04:13.080> art<00:04:13.350> piece<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.370> shows<00:04:14.670> there<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.750> so

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
an art piece and it shows there is so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.170 
an art piece and it shows there is so
much<00:04:16.410> symbolism<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> dissect<00:04:17.670> in<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:17.970> piece

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
much symbolism to dissect in this piece

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.789 
much symbolism to dissect in this piece
that<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.390> would<00:04:18.510> take<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> pretty<00:04:19.080> long<00:04:19.230> video

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799
