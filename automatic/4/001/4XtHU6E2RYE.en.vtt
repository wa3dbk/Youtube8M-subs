believe<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> toner<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> laser<00:00:57.090> printer

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
believe the toner it is a laser printer

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
believe the toner it is a laser printer
so<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.870> tone<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> reckon<00:00:59.129> that's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so you get tone of it I reckon that's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
so you get tone of it I reckon that's
paper<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.600> power<00:01:00.809> light

paper you got some kind of power light

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.700 
paper you got some kind of power light
and<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> connection<00:01:02.850> need

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and you don't get the connection need

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.920 
and you don't get the connection need
it's<00:01:04.710> acceptable<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.760> Mac<00:01:06.090> OS<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.900> windows

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's acceptable on Mac OS and windows

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.810
