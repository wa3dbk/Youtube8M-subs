to know about neon tetras it's just that

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.830 
to know about neon tetras it's just that
you're<00:02:37.160> small<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.910> first<00:02:38.240> started<00:02:38.630> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
you're small when I first started I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.710 
you're small when I first started I
added<00:02:39.560> five<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:40.130> my<00:02:40.220> tank<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.420> night

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
added five to my tank and that night

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
added five to my tank and that night
they<00:02:42.140> all<00:02:42.170> were<00:02:42.410> gone<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:42.860> they<00:02:43.160> were

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
they all were gone because they were

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.910 
they all were gone because they were
eating<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.090> these<00:02:44.209> fish<00:02:44.510> are<00:02:44.690> super<00:02:45.050> tiny<00:02:45.260> so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
eating so these fish are super tiny so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.470 
eating so these fish are super tiny so
you<00:02:45.950> got<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> make<00:02:46.400> sure<00:02:46.580> there's<00:02:46.880> no<00:02:47.090> fish<00:02:47.330> in

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
you got to make sure there's no fish in

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.120 
you got to make sure there's no fish in
here<00:02:47.600> that's<00:02:47.870> able<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> eat<00:02:48.350> them<00:02:48.560> now

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
here that's able to eat them now

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
here that's able to eat them now
eventually<00:02:49.459> these<00:02:49.820> parasitic<00:02:50.270> lows<00:02:50.570> will

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
eventually these parasitic lows will

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.300 
eventually these parasitic lows will
grow<00:02:51.020> up<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.380> we'll<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:51.620> able<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.920> eat<00:02:52.130> them

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
grow up and we'll be able to eat them

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.920 
grow up and we'll be able to eat them
but<00:02:52.850> by<00:02:52.970> then<00:02:53.150> they're<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.570> go<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.840> from

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
but by then they're going to go on from

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.500 
but by then they're going to go on from
this<00:02:54.140> tank<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:55.250> make<00:02:55.400> sure<00:02:55.640> when<00:02:56.390> you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.780 
and red just looks awesome passing the
green<00:03:38.390> leaves<00:03:38.630> but<00:03:39.380> they<00:03:40.190> don't<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.670> be<00:03:40.760> a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
green leaves but they don't have to be a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.070 
green leaves but they don't have to be a
planted<00:03:41.180> tank<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.570> keep<00:03:41.720> them<00:03:41.840> at<00:03:41.930> any
