00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
is good what else I thought was cool as

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
is good what else I thought was cool as
it<00:00:35.820> came<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> stand<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.840> went<00:00:37.260> they

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it came with a stand that went they

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.150 
it came with a stand that went they
connected<00:00:38.309> from<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> rack<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.480> sat<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.680> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
connected from the rack and sat you just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
connected from the rack and sat you just
stick<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.820> snare<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.420> into<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> rack<00:00:43.170> for

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
some people who always need it from the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.340 
some people who always need it from the
same<00:00:45.780> place<00:00:46.399> that's<00:00:47.399> perfect

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
same place that's perfect

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.279 
same place that's perfect
I've<00:00:49.649> never<00:00:49.829> seen<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> before<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
I've never seen that before which is

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.930 
I've never seen that before which is
great

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
great

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.870 
great
pretty<00:00:53.940> innovative

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
pretty innovative

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.810 
pretty innovative
it's<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.540> big<00:00:56.810> big<00:00:57.530> kit<00:00:57.829> bigger<00:00:58.220> kit<00:00:58.520> didn't<00:00:58.790> I

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
it's a big big kit bigger kit didn't I

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's a big big kit bigger kit didn't I
think<00:00:58.880> I've<00:00:59.150> ever<00:00:59.180> used<00:00:59.420> eleven<00:01:00.110> piece<00:01:00.290> I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
think I've ever used eleven piece I

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.760 
think I've ever used eleven piece I
think<00:01:01.940> twelve<00:01:02.600> because<00:01:03.020> there's<00:01:03.290> two<00:01:03.500> snares

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
think twelve because there's two snares

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:12.250 
think twelve because there's two snares
and<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.519> cymbal<00:01:04.910> setup<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:10.750> twelve<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:12.050> well

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
and the cymbal setup is twelve as well

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.290 
and the cymbal setup is twelve as well
so<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.580> guess<00:01:14.180> it's<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.600> twenty<00:01:14.960> four<00:01:15.200> piece<00:01:16.300> set

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
so I guess it's a twenty four piece set

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.690 
so I guess it's a twenty four piece set
up<00:01:17.450> every<00:01:17.720> day<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.170> know<00:01:19.070> we'll<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:19.460> have

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
up every day you know we'll just have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.240 
up every day you know we'll just have
the<00:01:19.850> rugs<00:01:20.090> marked<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:21.500> it's<00:01:21.710> setup<00:01:22.009> from

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
the rugs marked but it's setup from

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.920 
the rugs marked but it's setup from
scratch<00:01:22.550> every<00:01:22.880> day<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:23.509> everything's

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
scratch every day but everything's

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.440 
scratch every day but everything's
memory<00:01:24.350> locked<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.979> locks<00:01:25.220> are<00:01:25.490> are

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
memory locked and the locks are are

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.420 
memory locked and the locks are are
perfect<00:01:26.990> nothing<00:01:27.710> moves

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.830 

yeah<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.000> surprising<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.780> you

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
especially since you know fact that my

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.249 
especially since you know fact that my
kids<00:01:35.450> setup<00:01:36.080> has<00:01:36.410> curved<00:01:36.890> bars<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.670> usually

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
kids setup has curved bars and usually

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.749 
kids setup has curved bars and usually
you<00:01:39.259> know<00:01:39.410> when<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.590> have<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.830> kind<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
you know when you have that kind of the

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.779 
you know when you have that kind of the
lots<00:01:41.509> tend<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.899> try<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.289> move<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.009> it's<00:01:43.430> solid

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
lots tend to try to move and it's solid

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.719 
lots tend to try to move and it's solid
this<00:01:44.360> wreck<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:45.140> don't<00:01:45.680> have<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.490> same
