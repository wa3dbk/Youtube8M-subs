to show you how to make any beyblade you

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.790 
to show you how to make any beyblade you
have<00:00:07.440> ended<00:00:08.069> first<00:00:09.059> take<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.780> spin<00:00:10.290> track<00:00:10.559> and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
have ended first take a spin track and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.250 
have ended first take a spin track and
take<00:00:11.010> off<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> performance<00:00:11.670> tip<00:00:12.120> like<00:00:12.719> show

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.500 

second<00:00:16.260> take<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> ball<00:00:17.039> bearing<00:00:17.279> small<00:00:18.180> enough

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
second take a ball bearing small enough

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
second take a ball bearing small enough
to<00:00:18.750> fit<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.199> base<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> spin<00:00:20.279> track

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to fit in this base and the spin track

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.840 
to fit in this base and the spin track
next<00:00:21.439> superglue<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.619> ball<00:00:22.859> bearings<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
next superglue the ball bearings to the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
next superglue the ball bearings to the
spin<00:00:24.090> track<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.840> you're<00:00:25.019> done<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> what

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
spin track when you're done this is what

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
spin track when you're done this is what
it<00:00:26.310> should<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:31.009> okay<00:00:32.180> now<00:00:33.180> let's<00:00:33.960> see

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
it should look like okay now let's see

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.680 
it should look like okay now let's see
how<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.590> performs<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> four<00:00:36.030> types<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
how it performs to get to four types of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.470 
how it performs to get to four types of
a<00:00:41.480> first<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:43.440> here's<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> attack<00:00:44.489> based<00:00:44.850> on

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a first here here's the attack based on

sourcing stay still and as storm pegasus

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.310 
sourcing stay still and as storm pegasus
runs<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:04.309> pure<00:01:05.309> efficiency<00:01:05.610> gains<00:01:06.600> more

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
runs out pure efficiency gains more

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.420 
runs out pure efficiency gains more
speed<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.600> colder<00:01:12.950> let's<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
speed and get colder let's do the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:26.690 
speed and get colder let's do the
defense<00:01:14.970> big<00:01:15.330> rock<00:01:15.960> Scorpio<00:01:24.950> now<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.640> a
