 Knicks in a big bowl of water 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.280
 shaped eggplant zebra stripes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 cut the black should be like that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 be as low as possible because that's relative 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 bitter is then once in the middle 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 cut through 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.809
 if he has narrow long aubergines 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.960
 then you can just do it all over 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.120
 leave and the aubergines then about 20 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.610
 minutes in the water 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.100
 I complain about that with a plate 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.530
 then do my teapot on it and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.160
 let the whole 20 minutes just like that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.440
 cold water then become a big one 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.899
 just have a bit of oil 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.500
 and the eggplants dry up and on 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.560
 All then distribute with aluminum foil 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 cover and circulate at 200 degrees 30 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.150
 for minutes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.150
 there you can 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.930
 now cut the whole vegetables small 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 the onions parsley and the paprika 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.140
 I have the yellow paprika for me 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 side we need for the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:51.700
 Deko I still owe you as always 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:01.869
 a turkish word and fitting today 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:03.729
 on the subject itself vegetables now 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.440
 still cut the tomatoes in the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.039
 In the meantime, I have cooked water 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 because we want to peel the tomatoes and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.709
 For that you have to short the tomatoes 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.920
 just blanch into the hot 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.310
 water to give 30 seconds long in 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.950
 pull and then with a 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.260
 get out ladle and short 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.790
 scare off 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.170
 then you can easily skin them 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.450
 and cut eight decorative ones 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.209
 I cut off one sixth 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.980
 tomato ever and then stop by one 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.560
 another two slices and the other 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.549
 rest i just cut myself into small ones 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 fine dice 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.680
 we'll make the filling out of it right away 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.459
 and now the yellow peppers 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 each in four parts cut the green 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.170
 what I got but I get the kernels 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:12.640
 out because I think so nice with 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:16.799
 heat the green in a saucepan 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.540
 and fry the onions in a glassy sauce 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.220
 before I give the cloves of garlic 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.200
 you can really use the press through it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.909
 finely chop 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.049
 I'll smear it with the onions 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.360
 in oil 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.860
 I used a lot of oil because 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 that is a flavor 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.770
 Now I give the paprika heat 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.569
 So the non-decorative paprika and 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.709
 I also roast my tomato paste with me 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.920
 lawyer there is a very nice 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:53.410
 taste only the tomatoes inside 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.590
 then add all the salt and pepper 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.590
 and briefly I still have a pinch of sugar 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.690
 Added to and so on shortly drove on 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:08.800
 tip and then you can already 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:10.450
 parsley in there and yes that 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.790
 eggplants are ready now and with 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.320
 help of two forks I'm there 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.780
 Now she wants to be so cool 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:25.919
 can fill in salt now and then 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.919
 can you fill it already 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.650
 only the tomatoes and the peppers 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.890
 distribute on it and the whole at 160 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.000
 degrees circulating for another 20 to 25 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:45.940
 minutes to bake until, so to speak, the peppers 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.290
 lose their structure a bit and 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.310
 then you can serve it too 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.210
