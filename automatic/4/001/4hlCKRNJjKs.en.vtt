00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
layer so command shift and if you're on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
layer so command shift and if you're on
a<00:01:53.399> Mac<00:01:53.610> ctrl<00:01:54.180> shift<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:54.840> all

we're going to change the angle up to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.589 
we're going to change the angle up to
maybe<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:39.299> say<00:02:40.290> negative<00:02:40.890> 32<00:02:41.459> degrees<00:02:42.269> and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
actually send the blending mode of this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.380 
actually send the blending mode of this
to<00:02:48.840> overlay<00:02:49.440> itself<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.940> gonna<00:02:51.030> make<00:02:51.239> it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
to overlay itself and it's gonna make it

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.910 
to overlay itself and it's gonna make it
much<00:02:51.690> much<00:02:51.959> lighter<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.650> only<00:02:52.739> gonna

much much lighter and it's only gonna

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.000 
much much lighter and it's only gonna
focus<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.640> area<00:02:53.849> that<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.180> put<00:02:54.390> grey<00:02:54.599> on

focus on that area that we put grey on
so<00:02:56.010> we're<00:02:56.190> gonna<00:02:56.280> duplicate<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> layer<00:02:57.090> down

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
so we're gonna duplicate the layer down

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.900 
so we're gonna duplicate the layer down
so<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.660> click<00:02:57.959> duplicate<00:02:58.920> layer<00:02:58.980> press<00:02:59.579> ok

made over here we have a planet and
there's<00:05:43.470> some<00:05:43.620> light<00:05:43.800> source<00:05:44.070> coming<00:05:44.280> in

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
there's some light source coming in

there's some light source coming in
front<00:05:44.760> of<00:05:44.849> it<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.659> could<00:05:45.780> be<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.050> Sun<00:05:46.320> that

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
front of it that could be the Sun that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
make a new layer above this levels okay

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.939 
make a new layer above this levels okay
and<00:05:54.000> we're<00:05:54.690> gonna<00:05:54.810> select<00:05:55.139> the<00:05:55.710> brush<00:05:55.889> tool

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
and we're gonna select the brush tool

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
large soft brush we're gonna just click

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.100 
large soft brush we're gonna just click
on<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:01.949> light<00:06:02.340> source<00:06:02.550> up<00:06:02.820> there<00:06:03.030> okay<00:06:03.810> and

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
on that light source up there okay and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.020 
on that light source up there okay and
now<00:06:04.860> what<00:06:04.979> we<00:06:05.099> want<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.370> do<00:06:05.490> is<00:06:05.580> make<00:06:05.729> a<00:06:05.760> new

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
now what we want to do is make a new

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.420 
now what we want to do is make a new
layer<00:06:06.240> for<00:06:06.570> a<00:06:06.599> lens<00:06:06.870> flare<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:08.039> let's<00:06:08.250> make

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
layer for a lens flare so let's make

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.820 
layer for a lens flare so let's make
that<00:06:08.460> layer<00:06:08.849> press<00:06:09.389> ok<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.020> then<00:06:10.650> we're<00:06:10.740> gonna

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
that layer press ok and then we're gonna

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.370 
that layer press ok and then we're gonna
fill<00:06:11.159> that<00:06:11.250> in<00:06:11.400> with<00:06:11.550> black<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.229> then<00:06:13.229> we're

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
fill that in with black and then we're

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.930 
fill that in with black and then we're
gonna<00:06:13.470> change<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:14.039> blending<00:06:14.340> mode<00:06:14.400> to<00:06:14.699> screen

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
gonna change the blending mode to screen

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.460 
gonna change the blending mode to screen
so<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.300> black<00:06:15.479> doesn't<00:06:15.720> show<00:06:15.990> because<00:06:16.349> we

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
so the black doesn't show because we

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.830 
so the black doesn't show because we
just<00:06:16.650> want<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.919> lens<00:06:17.099> flare<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.370> show<00:06:17.639> and<00:06:17.909> to

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
just want the lens flare to show and to

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.060 
just want the lens flare to show and to
actually<00:06:19.110> make<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.409> lens<00:06:19.560> flare<00:06:19.800> we're<00:06:19.949> gonna

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
actually make the lens flare we're gonna

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.399 
actually make the lens flare we're gonna
click<00:06:20.280> on<00:06:20.400> filter<00:06:20.880> we're<00:06:21.630> gonna<00:06:21.750> hover<00:06:22.020> over

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
click on filter we're gonna hover over

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.430 
click on filter we're gonna hover over
render<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.070> click<00:06:23.460> on<00:06:23.610> lens<00:06:23.880> flare<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:25.289> could

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
render and click on lens flare you could

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.290 
render and click on lens flare you could
really<00:06:25.620> mess<00:06:25.860> with<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.280> type<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.760> lens<00:06:27.090> flare

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
really mess with the type of lens flare

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.839 
really mess with the type of lens flare
that<00:06:27.419> you<00:06:27.570> want<00:06:27.949> I'm<00:06:28.949> probably<00:06:29.430> gonna<00:06:29.639> end<00:06:29.729> up

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
that you want I'm probably gonna end up

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.430 
that you want I'm probably gonna end up
choosing<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.320> 105<00:06:31.320> millimeter<00:06:31.620> prime<00:06:33.409> with<00:06:34.409> a

choosing the 105 millimeter prime with a

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.750 
choosing the 105 millimeter prime with a
brightness<00:06:34.889> of<00:06:35.070> about<00:06:35.279> a<00:06:35.310> hundred<00:06:35.669> percent

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
brightness of about a hundred percent

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.920 
brightness of about a hundred percent
press<00:06:36.659> ok<00:06:36.960> and<00:06:38.029> we<00:06:39.029> can<00:06:39.060> move<00:06:39.300> this<00:06:39.419> around<00:06:39.570> a

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
press ok and we can move this around a

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
press ok and we can move this around a
little<00:06:40.139> bit<00:06:40.380> if<00:06:40.469> we

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
little bit if we

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.380 
little bit if we
but<00:06:41.190> that's<00:06:41.340> looking<00:06:41.490> pretty<00:06:41.910> good<00:06:42.060> on<00:06:42.120> its

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
but that's looking pretty good on its

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.420 
but that's looking pretty good on its
own<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:42.780> then<00:06:43.560> one<00:06:43.770> last<00:06:43.950> thing<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.400> just

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
own and then one last thing I just

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.670 
own and then one last thing I just
wanted<00:06:44.880> to<00:06:44.940> add<00:06:45.090> that<00:06:45.120> planet<00:06:45.960> shape<00:06:46.230> figure

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
wanted to add that planet shape figure

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.560 
wanted to add that planet shape figure
so<00:06:47.220> we're<00:06:47.400> gonna<00:06:47.520> make<00:06:47.760> another<00:06:48.150> new<00:06:48.360> layer

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
so we're gonna make another new layer

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.320 
so we're gonna make another new layer
perhaps<00:06:49.200> okay<00:06:49.650> make<00:06:50.550> sure<00:06:50.580> we<00:06:50.850> have<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.120> color

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
perhaps okay make sure we have the color

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.690 
perhaps okay make sure we have the color
black<00:06:51.600> selected<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.440> we're<00:06:53.250> gonna<00:06:53.340> choose

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
black selected and we're gonna choose

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.810 
black selected and we're gonna choose
this<00:06:53.940> tool<00:06:54.300> the<00:06:54.720> ellipse<00:06:55.200> tool<00:06:55.530> and<00:06:55.820> we're

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
this tool the ellipse tool and we're

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.240 
this tool the ellipse tool and we're
gonna<00:06:56.940> hold<00:06:57.150> down<00:06:57.270> shift<00:06:57.690> and<00:06:57.870> click<00:06:58.190> and<00:06:59.190> drag

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
gonna hold down shift and click and drag

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.780 
gonna hold down shift and click and drag
to<00:07:00.030> make<00:07:00.150> that<00:07:00.360> planet<00:07:00.600> and<00:07:01.490> then<00:07:02.490> we<00:07:02.670> could

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
to make that planet and then we could

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.340 
to make that planet and then we could
just<00:07:02.820> hide<00:07:03.120> it<00:07:03.270> behind<00:07:03.420> a<00:07:03.720> couple<00:07:04.020> different

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
just hide it behind a couple different

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.200 
just hide it behind a couple different
layers<00:07:04.530> like<00:07:04.860> so<00:07:06.110> and<00:07:07.490> there<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:08.640> go<00:07:08.790> we're

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
layers like so and there you go we're

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.940 
layers like so and there you go we're
pretty<00:07:09.450> much<00:07:09.690> done<00:07:10.050> with<00:07:10.080> this<00:07:10.380> really<00:07:10.650> really

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
pretty much done with this really really

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.060 
pretty much done with this really really
