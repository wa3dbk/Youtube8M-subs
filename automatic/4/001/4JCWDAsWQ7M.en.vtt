 design with such pieces all the vegetables I have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.540
 prepared 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.870
 Now you can begin roasting for 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.990
 this I will include in the stove and as much 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.670
 I will warm up the pan for that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.600
 so that the vegetables are not stewed not cooked 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.400
 immediately seized instantly roasted 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.840
