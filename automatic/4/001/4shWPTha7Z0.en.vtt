00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.240 
29th birthday for me to be a grandmother
and<00:00:26.140> I<00:00:27.150> realized<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:28.539> each<00:00:29.080> person<00:00:30.070> was

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
and I realized that each person was

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.660 
and I realized that each person was
about<00:00:30.730> 13<00:00:31.390> or<00:00:31.420> 14<00:00:31.599> at<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.470> time<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:33.070> delivery

and that this was something that was

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.299 
and that this was something that was
happening<00:00:36.430> from<00:00:37.089> one<00:00:37.269> generation<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.710> again

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
like the player gets to decide what

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.560

ci3<00:04:58.360> is<00:04:58.660> really<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.380> commitment<00:04:59.800> to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
ci3 is really a so commitment to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.130 
ci3 is really a so commitment to
translation<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:01.090> thinking<00:05:01.450> about<00:05:01.540> how<00:05:01.690> some

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
translation so thinking about how some

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.270 
translation so thinking about how some
of<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.320> research<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.650> we're<00:05:03.040> bringing

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
of the research that we're bringing

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.390 
of the research that we're bringing
together<00:05:03.550> here<00:05:04.210> could<00:05:04.960> inform<00:05:05.680> potentially

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
together here could inform potentially

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.670 
together here could inform potentially
let's<00:05:06.610> say<00:05:06.729> programs<00:05:07.240> in<00:05:07.720> middle<00:05:08.350> schools<00:05:08.590> in

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
let's say programs in middle schools in

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.700 
especially I think is ripe for that
