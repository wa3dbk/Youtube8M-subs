from<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> girls<00:00:23.279> x-ray<00:00:23.609> plot<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.420> see

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
from the girls x-ray plot you can see

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
from the girls x-ray plot you can see
that<00:00:24.660> we've<00:00:24.900> had<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> few<00:00:25.350> spiky<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:26.010> flares<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that we've had a few spiky be flares and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.990 
that we've had a few spiky be flares and
the<00:00:27.449> background<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.960> started<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> rise<00:00:29.000> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the background is started to rise this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.099 
the background is started to rise this
generally<00:00:30.269> means<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:30.869> something

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
generally means that there's something

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
generally means that there's something
somewhere<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.769> growing<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.910> there's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> new

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
somewhere is growing or there's a new

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
somewhere is growing or there's a new
region<00:00:33.570> emerging<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> new<00:00:34.770> region<00:00:34.950> coming

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
region emerging or a new region coming

region emerging or a new region coming
over<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> years<00:00:35.760> limb<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.809> let's<00:00:36.989> take<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> look

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
over the years limb so let's take a look

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
over the years limb so let's take a look
at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> sunspot<00:00:37.829> regions<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:39.120> what's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
at the sunspot regions and see what's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.619 
at the sunspot regions and see what's
going<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> sunspot<00:00:41.790> situation<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.450> nearly

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
going on the sunspot situation is nearly

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.830 
going on the sunspot situation is nearly
as<00:00:42.750> complicated<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.680> yesterday

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
as complicated as it was yesterday

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.889 
as complicated as it was yesterday
region<00:00:45.840> 12<00:00:45.870> 45<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> 1253<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.780> never

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
region 12 45 or was it 1253 I can never

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.889 
region 12 45 or was it 1253 I can never
remember<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.440> died<00:00:50.070> away<00:00:50.370> overnight<00:00:50.899> however

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
remember now died away overnight however

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
remember now died away overnight however
a<00:00:51.989> new<00:00:52.170> region<00:00:52.379> popped<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> behind<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.460> matt<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
a new region popped up behind it matt is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.279 
a new region popped up behind it matt is
growing<00:00:54.090> rapidly<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
growing rapidly and I think that is the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
growing rapidly and I think that is the
origin<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> both<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> spiky<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.090> flares<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
origin of both the spiky be flares and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.680 
origin of both the spiky be flares and
also<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> increase<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> background<00:00:59.690> region

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
also the increase in background region

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
also the increase in background region
1250<00:01:01.410> remains<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.890> single<00:01:02.219> large<00:01:02.399> spot<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
1250 remains a single large spot and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
1250 remains a single large spot and
it's<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.629> stable<00:01:04.309> same<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> 1251<00:01:06.380> region

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it's very stable same as 1251 region

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.149 
it's very stable same as 1251 region
1256<00:01:08.090> seems<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.270> decayed<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.930> bit

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
1256 seems to have decayed a little bit

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.940 
1256 seems to have decayed a little bit
and<00:01:11.159> region<00:01:11.490> 1254<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> southeast

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and region 1254 down in the southeast

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.060 
and region 1254 down in the southeast
has<00:01:14.640> grown<00:01:14.850> quite<00:01:15.090> significantly<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> may<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
has grown quite significantly so may be

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
has grown quite significantly so may be
contributing<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> increase<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
contributing to this increase in the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
contributing to this increase in the
background<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> maybe<00:01:20.189> even<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
background and maybe even some of the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
background and maybe even some of the
small<00:01:21.030> flares<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
small flares here I'm going to have to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
small flares here I'm going to have to
take<00:01:23.220> issue<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.549> Noah<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.750> seems<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
take issue with Noah there seems to be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.819 
take issue with Noah there seems to be
some<00:01:25.290> confusion<00:01:25.320> between<00:01:25.920> regions<00:01:26.700> 1252<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
some confusion between regions 1252 and

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.440 
some confusion between regions 1252 and
1255<00:01:29.119> they<00:01:30.119> claim<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> 1255<00:01:31.229> died<00:01:31.590> away<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
1255 they claim that 1255 died away and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
1255 they claim that 1255 died away and
1252<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.810> still<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
1252 is still there I think it's the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
1252 is still there I think it's the
other<00:01:35.520> way<00:01:35.700> around<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> look<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
other way around you take a look at the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.640 
other way around you take a look at the
magnetic<00:01:38.820> movie<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> sunspot<00:01:40.140> movie<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
magnetic movie and the sunspot movie I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.889 
magnetic movie and the sunspot movie I
think<00:01:41.189> you'll<00:01:41.310> agree<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.579> me<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:42.689> also

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
think you'll agree with me there's also

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
think you'll agree with me there's also
a<00:01:43.020> tiny<00:01:43.560> region<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> couple<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
a tiny region with just a couple of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.240 
a tiny region with just a couple of
spots

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
spots

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.020 
spots
up<00:01:46.460> behind<00:01:46.880> region<00:01:47.590> 1255<00:01:48.590> near<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> northeast

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
up behind region 1255 near the northeast

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.390 
up behind region 1255 near the northeast
slim<00:01:50.350> we'll<00:01:51.350> see<00:01:51.560> whether<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.950> amount<00:01:52.220> or

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
slim we'll see whether that amount or

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.150 
slim we'll see whether that amount or
anything<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.910> next<00:01:53.150> couple<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.510> days

anything in the next couple of days
you're<00:01:55.160> probably<00:01:55.370> going<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.700> have<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.820> run<00:01:56.120> the

you're probably going to have to run the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.900 
you're probably going to have to run the

24<00:02:32.239> hours<00:02:32.480> ago<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.720> looked<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.820> not<00:02:34.820> the

24 hours ago it looked like this not the

in 24 hours it becomes like this which
is<00:02:48.680> quite<00:02:48.830> an<00:02:49.010> impressive<00:02:49.280> region<00:02:49.820> this<00:02:50.720> sort

is quite an impressive region this sort

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.600 
is quite an impressive region this sort
of<00:02:51.110> explosive<00:02:51.440> growth<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.190> sort<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.459> thing

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
of explosive growth is the sort of thing

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.000 
of explosive growth is the sort of thing
that<00:02:52.640> produces<00:02:53.239> flares<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:54.590> might<00:02:54.769> expect

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
that produces flares we might expect

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
some larger flares from this region in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.020 
some larger flares from this region in
the<00:02:56.900> near<00:02:57.049> future<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:58.430> fact<00:02:58.670> I'm<00:02:58.910> rather

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
the near future in fact I'm rather

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.220 
the near future in fact I'm rather
surprised<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.630> we<00:02:59.690> haven't<00:02:59.900> had<00:03:00.049> some

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
surprised that we haven't had some

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.710 
surprised that we haven't had some
already<00:03:00.350> in<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.610> transition<00:03:02.090> region<00:03:02.209> movie

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
already in the transition region movie

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.020 
already in the transition region movie
that's<00:03:02.900> about<00:03:02.959> 50,000<00:03:03.890> degrees<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.910> see

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
that's about 50,000 degrees you can see

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.940 
that's about 50,000 degrees you can see
a<00:03:05.060> lot<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.239> minor<00:03:05.600> filaments<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.200> prominences

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
a lot of minor filaments and prominences

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.830 
a lot of minor filaments and prominences
erupting<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:08.120> none<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.269> them<00:03:08.390> seem<00:03:08.630> large

erupting but none of them seem large

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.509 
erupting but none of them seem large
enough<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.110> produce<00:03:09.290> major<00:03:09.890> coronal<00:03:10.370> mass

enough to produce major coronal mass
ejections<00:03:11.090> I've<00:03:12.130> marked<00:03:13.130> here<00:03:13.519> for<00:03:14.360> filaments

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.319 
ejections I've marked here for filaments
that<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.019> think<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.350> likely<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.739> erupt<00:03:16.209> one<00:03:17.209> is

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
that I think are likely to erupt one is

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.819 
that I think are likely to erupt one is
on<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> back<00:03:17.720> side<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.290> Sun<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
on the back side of the Sun up in the

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.280 
on the back side of the Sun up in the
northwest<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.600> think<00:03:20.900> that's<00:03:21.079> most

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
northwest the one I think that's most

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.180 
northwest the one I think that's most
likely<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.860> go<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.670> one<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.090> southwest

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
likely to go is the one in the southwest

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.410 
likely to go is the one in the southwest
there<00:03:25.190> are<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:25.340> smaller<00:03:25.670> ones<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
there are two smaller ones in the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.660 
there are two smaller ones in the
Northeast<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.170> southeast<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.400> also

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
Northeast and the southeast that also

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.140 
Northeast and the southeast that also
have<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.880> possibility<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.780> erupting

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
have a possibility of erupting

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.670 
have a possibility of erupting
so<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.360> should<00:03:31.390> keep<00:03:31.569> an<00:03:31.720> eye<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:31.840> these<00:03:32.140> over

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
so we should keep an eye on these over

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.949 
so we should keep an eye on these over
the<00:03:32.769> next<00:03:33.010> few<00:03:33.129> days<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> low-temperature

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the next few days in the low-temperature

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.569 
the next few days in the low-temperature
corona<00:03:35.379> movie<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.799> can<00:03:35.950> see<00:03:36.069> a<00:03:36.099> small<00:03:36.370> region

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579

they use the Apollo capsule to block out

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.819 
they use the Apollo capsule to block out

I<00:06:16.029> think<00:06:16.719> that's<00:06:16.839> actually<00:06:17.110> quite<00:06:17.229> clever

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
I think that's actually quite clever

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.610 
I think that's actually quite clever
so<00:06:19.320> that's<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.590> for<00:06:19.770> today<00:06:20.480> keep<00:06:21.480> safe<00:06:21.720> bye<00:06:22.410> for

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.650 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for
now
