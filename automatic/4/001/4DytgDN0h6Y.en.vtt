00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
main reason well because of the size is

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.130 
main reason well because of the size is
just<00:00:26.950> perfect<00:00:27.640> perfect<00:00:28.270> size<00:00:28.570> I'm<00:00:28.810> it's<00:00:28.990> not

just perfect perfect size I'm it's not
too<00:00:29.380> big<00:00:29.560> it's<00:00:29.620> not<00:00:29.950> too<00:00:30.070> small<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.390> also<00:00:31.570> i

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
too big it's not too small and also i

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.080 
too big it's not too small and also i
was<00:00:31.960> able<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.410> make<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.680> very<00:00:33.219> long<00:00:33.550> distance

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
was able to make a very long distance

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.280 
was able to make a very long distance
casting<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.890> best<00:00:36.160> of<00:00:36.340> all<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:37.720> hooking

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
casting the best of all is this hooking

casting the best of all is this hooking
system<00:00:39.210> i'll<00:00:40.210> show<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.660> how<00:00:40.780> this<00:00:41.079> works<00:00:41.140> it's

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
system i'll show you how this works it's

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.970 
system i'll show you how this works it's
usually<00:00:42.670> this<00:00:42.910> way<00:00:43.180> it's<00:00:43.810> got<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.079> two<00:00:44.350> big

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
usually this way it's got a two big

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.540 
usually this way it's got a two big
super<00:00:45.640> sharp<00:00:45.850> treble<00:00:46.270> hooks<00:00:46.450> on<00:00:46.690> here<00:00:47.050> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
super sharp treble hooks on here and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.810 
super sharp treble hooks on here and
when<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.579> fish<00:00:48.940> bite<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.130> does<00:00:51.340> is<00:00:51.610> as

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
when the fish bite what it does is as

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
when the fish bite what it does is as
much<00:00:52.600> as<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.230> fish<00:00:53.500> bigger<00:00:53.860> fish<00:00:54.160> bite<00:00:54.840> they

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
much as the fish bigger fish bite they

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.139 
much as the fish bigger fish bite they
cannot<00:00:56.260> use<00:00:56.440> leverage<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:57.579> get<00:00:57.700> up<00:00:57.850> from<00:00:58.030> the

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
cannot use leverage to get up from the

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.979 
cannot use leverage to get up from the
hook<00:00:58.300> because<00:00:58.510> this<00:00:58.930> thing<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.200> very<00:00:59.320> free<00:01:00.250> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hook because this thing is very free and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.289 
hook because this thing is very free and
i<00:01:01.989> really<00:01:02.380> didn't<00:01:02.590> lose<00:01:02.800> any<00:01:03.010> fish<00:01:03.340> after<00:01:03.550> i

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
i really didn't lose any fish after i

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.020 
i really didn't lose any fish after i
said<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.930> hook<00:01:05.049> on<00:01:05.199> those<00:01:05.409> fish<00:01:05.759> so<00:01:06.759> that<00:01:06.909> was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
said to hook on those fish so that was

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.010 
said to hook on those fish so that was
the<00:01:07.150> biggest<00:01:07.390> difference<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:09.340> i<00:01:09.610> think<00:01:10.570> that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
the biggest difference that i think that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.190 
the biggest difference that i think that
i<00:01:11.049> was<00:01:11.290> able<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.860> land<00:01:12.130> those<00:01:12.370> fish<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.840> make<00:01:14.020> to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
i was able to land those fish to make to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.480 
i was able to land those fish to make to
the<00:01:14.380> final<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.270> also<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:16.479> tale<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.310> see

reason<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.310> biggest<00:01:36.610> reason<00:01:36.909> why<00:01:37.180> i

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
reason is the biggest reason why i

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.810 
reason is the biggest reason why i
wanted<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.170> bait<00:01:38.500> because<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.130> we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
wanted to have this bait because I we

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.130 
wanted to have this bait because I we
know<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.060> weren't<00:01:40.240> getting<00:01:40.360> many<00:01:40.720> bites<00:01:40.990> on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
know we weren't getting many bites on

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.390 
know we weren't getting many bites on
that<00:01:41.350> tournament<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.340> everybody<00:01:43.030> was<00:01:43.750> very

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
that tournament so everybody was very

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.260 
that tournament so everybody was very
invaluable<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.549> believe<00:01:48.549> this<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:48.970> why<00:01:49.240> I

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
invaluable so I believe this is why I

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.179 
invaluable so I believe this is why I
was<00:01:49.479> catching<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.140> landing<00:01:50.560> all<00:01:50.680> those<00:01:50.890> fish

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
was catching and landing all those fish

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
was catching and landing all those fish
to<00:01:51.460> make<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.759> define<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.390> tournament<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to make the define of the tournament and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.289 
to make the define of the tournament and
I'm<00:01:54.130> sure<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.640> you're<00:01:54.790> going<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.939> try<00:01:55.180> this

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
I'm sure if you're going to try this

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.320 
I'm sure if you're going to try this
bait<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:55.990> gave<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.590> shot<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.009> see<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:58.119> you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
bait and gave it a shot and see if you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.910 
bait and gave it a shot and see if you
can<00:01:58.450> catch<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.689> bigger<00:01:58.900> fish<00:01:58.990> without<00:01:59.530> losing

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
can catch a bigger fish without losing

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.950 
can catch a bigger fish without losing
too
