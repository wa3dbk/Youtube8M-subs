and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> use<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:54.930> amount<00:01:55.049> for

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and then I use about the same amount for

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.480 
and then I use about the same amount for
the<00:01:55.590> other<00:01:55.799> side

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the other side

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.120 
the other side
and<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:57.229> put<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> between<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.619> hands<00:01:58.890> this

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and I just put it between my hands this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
and I just put it between my hands this
just<00:01:59.340> helps<00:01:59.460> warm<00:01:59.850> up<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.119> product<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
just helps warm up the product so it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.190 
just helps warm up the product so it
doesn't<00:02:01.740> clump<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.759> all<00:02:02.880> sticky<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.869> your

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
doesn't clump and get all sticky in your

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
doesn't clump and get all sticky in your
hair<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> help<00:02:09.030> texturize

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
hair and this is going to help texturize

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.110 
hair and this is going to help texturize
the<00:02:10.050> waves<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.730> them<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the waves so you can really see them and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.630 
the waves so you can really see them and
it<00:02:12.239> kind<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> gives<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.930> PC<00:02:13.440> look<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.250> I'm

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it kind of gives that PC look then I'm

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.940 
it kind of gives that PC look then I'm
going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> use<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.390> Paul<00:02:15.840> Mitchell<00:02:16.260> soft

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
going to use my Paul Mitchell soft

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.729 
going to use my Paul Mitchell soft
sculpting<00:02:17.730> spray<00:02:18.150> gel<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.170> helps<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
sculpting spray gel and this helps to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.920 
sculpting spray gel and this helps to
hold<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.370> waves<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.790> place<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.720> also

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
hold the waves in place and it also

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.240 
hold the waves in place and it also
defines<00:02:22.500> them<00:02:22.769> as<00:02:22.980> well<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:25.739> want

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
defines them as well and you really want

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.580 
defines them as well and you really want
to<00:02:26.370> use<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.060> pretty<00:02:27.390> generous<00:02:27.900> amount<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
to use a pretty generous amount of this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.250 
to use a pretty generous amount of this
stuff<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.269> I'm<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.750> combing<00:02:30.959> my<00:02:31.230> hair

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
stuff and then I'm just combing my hair

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.800 
stuff and then I'm just combing my hair
back<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.340> braid<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
back so I can braid it I just like

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.890 
back so I can braid it I just like
pulling<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.910> front<00:02:36.120> pieces<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.750> my

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
pulling all of the front pieces of my

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.770 
pulling all of the front pieces of my
hair<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.290> back<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:39.600> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
hair to the back then I'm just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.670 
hair to the back then I'm just
separating<00:02:40.310> my<00:02:41.310> hair<00:02:41.519> into<00:02:41.760> three<00:02:42.090> sections

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
separating my hair into three sections

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
separating my hair into three sections
so<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> have<00:02:43.830> two<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> front<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.030> one

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so I have two in the front and then one

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.590 
so I have two in the front and then one
in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.959> back<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.620> I'm<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.489> going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.819> take

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
in the back and I'm just going to take

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.900 
in the back and I'm just going to take
these<00:02:48.750> three<00:02:49.080> sections<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.799> braid<00:02:50.130> them<00:02:50.489> into

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
these three sections and braid them into

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.870 
these three sections and braid them into
a<00:02:50.940> single<00:02:51.269> braid<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.190> doesn't<00:02:56.400> need<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
a single braid now this doesn't need to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.150 
a single braid now this doesn't need to
be<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> perfect<00:02:57.810> braid<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.799> want<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.099> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
be a perfect braid but you do want it to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.840 
be a perfect braid but you do want it to
be<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.430> secure<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.660> fairly<00:03:01.440> tight<00:03:01.769> braid<00:03:02.220> so

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
be a secure and fairly tight braid so

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.330 
be a secure and fairly tight braid so
the<00:03:03.359> waves<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> chance<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.440> develop<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
the waves have a chance to develop and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.009 
the waves have a chance to develop and
then<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.420> sitting<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.160> down<00:03:08.160> here<00:03:09.019> at

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
then I'm just sitting it down here at

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.770 
then I'm just sitting it down here at
the<00:03:10.140> bottom<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.910> my<00:03:12.150> finished<00:03:12.480> afraid

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the bottom so this is my finished afraid

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.900 
the bottom so this is my finished afraid
and<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.350> put<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.650> down<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.070> back<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.670> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
and I just put it down my back like that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.400 
and I just put it down my back like that
and<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:16.049> have<00:03:16.410> pretty<00:03:17.100> fine<00:03:17.880> textured<00:03:18.480> hair<00:03:18.810> so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and I have pretty fine textured hair so

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.620 
and I have pretty fine textured hair so
I<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.519> single<00:03:20.790> braid<00:03:21.090> down<00:03:21.239> my<00:03:21.450> back

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
I just do a single braid down my back

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.479 
I just do a single braid down my back
but<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.290> thicker<00:03:22.650> hair<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:23.370> I

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
but if you have thicker hair then I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.220 
but if you have thicker hair then I
would<00:03:23.670> recommend<00:03:24.120> doing<00:03:24.329> two<00:03:24.750> separate

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
would recommend doing two separate

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.830 
would recommend doing two separate
braids<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.739> one<00:03:26.069> on<00:03:26.310> each<00:03:26.609> side<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.540> if

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
braids so one on each side because if

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.750 
braids so one on each side because if
you<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.049> thicker<00:03:28.350> hair<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.730> just

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
you have thicker hair then if you just

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
you have thicker hair then if you just
do<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.980> single<00:03:31.980> braid<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.850> may<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.510> little

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
do one single braid it may be a little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.780 
do one single braid it may be a little
bit<00:03:33.989> too<00:03:34.350> thick<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.859> your<00:03:35.069> waves<00:03:35.340> may<00:03:35.640> not

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
bit too thick and your waves may not

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.030 
bit too thick and your waves may not
properly<00:03:36.390> develop<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.799> thicker

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
properly develop so if you have thicker

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800 
properly develop so if you have thicker
hair<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.519> would<00:03:38.940> recommend<00:03:39.359> doing<00:03:39.480> two

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
hair I would recommend doing two

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.870 
hair I would recommend doing two
separate<00:03:40.170> braids<00:03:40.440> if<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.190> fine<00:03:41.489> to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
separate braids if you have fine to

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.229 
separate braids if you have fine to
medium<00:03:42.299> hair<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.799> would<00:03:44.609> just<00:03:44.940> do<00:03:45.209> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
medium hair then I would just do a

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.900 
medium hair then I would just do a
single<00:03:45.510> braid<00:03:45.780> down<00:03:46.049> your<00:03:46.230> back<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.889> now<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.700> is

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
single braid down your back so now it is

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.960 
single braid down your back so now it is
time<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.359> me<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.959> go<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.319> bed<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.950> sleep<00:03:50.639> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
time for me to go to bed and sleep and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.210 
time for me to go to bed and sleep and
while<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.389> sleep<00:03:51.840> these<00:03:52.319> waves<00:03:52.920> will<00:03:53.160> be

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
while I sleep these waves will be

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
I slept my hair kind of came out a

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.090 
I slept my hair kind of came out a
little<00:04:09.020> bit<00:04:09.230> from<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> break<00:04:09.740> but<00:04:09.950> that's

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
little bit from the break but that's

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.460 
little bit from the break but that's
okay<00:04:10.550> because<00:04:10.580> for<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.180> most<00:04:11.360> part<00:04:11.510> my<00:04:12.170> hair

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
okay because for the most part my hair

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.310 
okay because for the most part my hair
is<00:04:12.740> still<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.670> braids<00:04:13.880> here<00:04:14.240> so<00:04:14.780> I'm<00:04:15.050> just

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
is still in the braids here so I'm just

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.280 
is still in the braids here so I'm just
going<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.770> release<00:04:16.700> my<00:04:16.910> braids<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.420> my<00:04:17.690> hair<00:04:17.989> I

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
going to release my braids and my hair I

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.540 
going to release my braids and my hair I
think<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:19.570> pretty<00:04:20.570> dry<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.230> may<00:04:21.340> still<00:04:22.340> be<00:04:22.520> a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
think is pretty dry it may still be a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.760 
think is pretty dry it may still be a
little<00:04:23.030> bit<00:04:23.150> damp<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:23.660> that's<00:04:24.050> okay<00:04:24.410> if<00:04:24.650> your

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
little bit damp and that's okay if your

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.970 
little bit damp and that's okay if your
hair<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.250> still<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.760> little<00:04:25.910> bit<00:04:26.120> damp<00:04:26.360> because

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
hair is still a little bit damp because

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.430 
hair is still a little bit damp because
you<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:29.180> just<00:04:29.360> let<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.690> dry<00:04:29.900> throughout<00:04:30.260> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
you can just let it dry throughout the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.720 
you can just let it dry throughout the
day<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.950> we're<00:04:31.100> going<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.280> put<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.430> little<00:04:31.610> bit

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
day and we're going to put a little bit

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.880 
day and we're going to put a little bit
more<00:04:31.850> product<00:04:32.450> on<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.320> sometimes<00:04:33.560> it

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
more product on it so sometimes it

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.470 
more product on it so sometimes it
actually<00:04:34.040> works<00:04:34.520> out<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.760> little<00:04:34.940> bit<00:04:35.210> better

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
actually works out a little bit better

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.090 
actually works out a little bit better
if<00:04:35.900> your<00:04:36.080> hair<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.530> still<00:04:36.860> slightly<00:04:37.669> damp<00:04:38.210> so

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
work it in and then I flip it around to

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.919 
work it in and then I flip it around to
the<00:05:48.530> other<00:05:48.800> side<00:05:50.710> that

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:56.929 

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.389 

and<00:05:57.929> then<00:05:58.050> just<00:05:58.319> work<00:05:58.499> it<00:05:58.679> into<00:05:58.830> my<00:05:59.039> hair<00:05:59.219> I

00:05:59.389 --> 00:05:59.399 
and then just work it into my hair I

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.399 
and then just work it into my hair I
kind<00:05:59.729> of<00:05:59.789> treat<00:06:00.059> it<00:06:00.149> like<00:06:00.300> it's<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.599> dry<00:06:00.869> shampoo

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
kind of treat it like it's a dry shampoo

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.290 
kind of treat it like it's a dry shampoo
but<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:02.009> is<00:06:02.159> the<00:06:02.249> finishing<00:06:02.610> spray<00:06:02.909> and<00:06:03.209> it

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
but this is the finishing spray and it

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.850 
but this is the finishing spray and it
works<00:06:03.509> really<00:06:03.959> really<00:06:04.110> well

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
works really really well

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.829 
works really really well
you<00:06:05.039> could<00:06:05.189> also<00:06:05.399> flip<00:06:05.909> over<00:06:06.360> your<00:06:06.509> hair<00:06:06.749> if

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
you could also flip over your hair if

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.169 
you could also flip over your hair if
you<00:06:06.959> want<00:06:07.229> for<00:06:07.409> even<00:06:07.709> more<00:06:07.919> volume<00:06:08.219> and<00:06:08.580> spray

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.179 
you want for even more volume and spray

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.909 
you want for even more volume and spray
this<00:06:09.360> at<00:06:09.599> your<00:06:09.749> roots<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.169> really<00:06:10.529> like<00:06:10.709> this

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
this at your roots I really like this

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.249 
this at your roots I really like this
because<00:06:11.399> it<00:06:11.639> kind<00:06:12.029> of<00:06:12.149> acts<00:06:12.419> like<00:06:12.599> a<00:06:12.869> root

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
because it kind of acts like a root

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.070 
because it kind of acts like a root
lifting<00:06:13.830> spray<00:06:14.099> for<00:06:14.399> me<00:06:14.520> but<00:06:14.999> it<00:06:15.270> doesn't<00:06:15.479> feel

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
lifting spray for me but it doesn't feel

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.010 
lifting spray for me but it doesn't feel
hard<00:06:16.919> and<00:06:17.339> crunchy<00:06:17.639> like<00:06:18.059> a<00:06:18.330> hair<00:06:18.629> spray<00:06:18.809> you

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
hard and crunchy like a hair spray you

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.179 
hard and crunchy like a hair spray you
just<00:06:19.199> want<00:06:19.319> to<00:06:19.379> make<00:06:19.499> sure<00:06:19.649> that<00:06:19.800> you<00:06:19.949> work

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
just want to make sure that you work

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.699 
just want to make sure that you work
your<00:06:20.369> fingers<00:06:20.759> through<00:06:21.119> it<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.869> it<00:06:22.349> gets

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:22.709 
your fingers through it so it gets

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.209 
your fingers through it so it gets
distributed<00:06:23.219> evenly<00:06:24.110> so<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.139> is<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:25.919> and

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
distributed evenly so that is it and
