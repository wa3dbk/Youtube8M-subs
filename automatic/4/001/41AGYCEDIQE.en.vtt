know that renekton's W can apply on hit

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
know that renekton's W can apply on hit
effects<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.200> example<00:01:10.400> lifesteal<00:01:11.400> static

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
effects for example lifesteal static

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.690 
effects for example lifesteal static
ship<00:01:12.330> critical<00:01:13.170> strikes<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.159> top<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
ship critical strikes and on top of that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.600 
ship critical strikes and on top of that
his<00:01:14.970> W<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.659> auto<00:01:15.900> attack<00:01:16.320> reset<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.430> make

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
his W is an auto attack reset so make

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
his W is an auto attack reset so make
sure<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> first<00:01:18.119> use<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.479> auto<00:01:18.689> attack<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sure to first use your auto attack and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
sure to first use your auto attack and
then<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> W<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> second<00:01:20.490> Auto<00:01:20.700> Attack

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
then use the W the second Auto Attack

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380 
then use the W the second Auto Attack
hits<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.780> maximize<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.470> damage<00:01:22.729> on<00:01:23.729> top<00:01:24.240> of

hits to maximize your damage on top of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
hits to maximize your damage on top of
what<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.869> said<00:01:25.259> his<00:01:25.530> W<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> very

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what I just said his W does have a very

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.359 
what I just said his W does have a very
long<00:01:27.150> cast<00:01:27.540> animation<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.070> trick<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
long cast animation and a good trick to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
long cast animation and a good trick to
maximize<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.180> damage<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.290> something

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
maximize your damage is to use something

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
maximize your damage is to use something
like<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> higher<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.610> Tiamat<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.630> after<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like a higher or Tiamat just after you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.590 
like a higher or Tiamat just after you
activate<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.680> W<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> cancel<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> rest<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
activate your W to cancel the rest of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
activate your W to cancel the rest of
the<00:01:36.689> wz<00:01:37.140> animation<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.520> important

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the wz animation it's a very important

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.719 
the wz animation it's a very important
trick<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> play<00:01:40.079> Renekton<00:01:40.729> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
trick to know if you play Renekton it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
trick to know if you play Renekton it
seems<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.329> Renekton<00:01:42.960> stun<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.680> his<00:01:43.860> W<00:01:44.250> will

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
seems that Renekton stun on his W will

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
seems that Renekton stun on his W will
still<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:44.970> through<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.780> Jax's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
still go through things like at Jax's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
still go through things like at Jax's
