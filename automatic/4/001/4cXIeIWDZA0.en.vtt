hi<00:00:02.340> um<00:00:02.580> we're<00:00:03.090> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> check<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.659> output

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hi um we're going to check the output

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.909 
hi um we're going to check the output
wattage<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.520> IC<00:00:06.000> 7000<00:00:06.810> we're<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
wattage on this IC 7000 we're going to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.470 
wattage on this IC 7000 we're going to
use<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> external<00:00:08.400> monitor<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.330> show

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
use the external monitor here to show

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.959 
use the external monitor here to show
you<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.630> frequency<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.849> we're<00:00:11.849> going

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
you what frequency we're on we're going

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.990 
you what frequency we're on we're going
to<00:00:12.030> start<00:00:12.210> at<00:00:12.360> 440<00:00:12.780> 6.000<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> UHF

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
to start at 440 6.000 with the UHF

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970 
to start at 440 6.000 with the UHF
portion<00:00:15.540> which<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.139> supposed<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> somewhere

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
portion which is supposed to a somewhere

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.960 
portion which is supposed to a somewhere
around<00:00:17.039> 35<00:00:17.430> watts<00:00:19.100> let<00:00:20.100> me<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.369> ahead<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.550> make

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
around 35 watts let me go ahead and make

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.029 
around 35 watts let me go ahead and make
sure<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.779> set<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.470> correctly<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
sure that this is set up correctly and

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.420 
sure that this is set up correctly and
it<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.670> toner<00:00:29.670> watt<00:00:29.910> range<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
it is it's on the toner watt range and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.690 
it is it's on the toner watt range and
let's<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:32.700> ahead<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.210> key<00:00:33.719> up

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.940 

shown<00:00:41.300> about<00:00:41.510> 40<00:00:42.140> watts<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:44.410> now<00:00:45.410> let's<00:00:45.739> go

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
shown about 40 watts and now let's go

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.790 
shown about 40 watts and now let's go
over<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:47.890> 2<00:00:48.890> meters<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.629> let's<00:00:50.629> see<00:00:51.110> what<00:00:51.680> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
over to 2 meters and let's see what the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.180 
over to 2 meters and let's see what the
output<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.220> here<00:00:55.839> we've<00:00:56.839> got<00:00:56.900> 50<00:00:57.320> watts<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.890> two

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
output is here we've got 50 watts on two

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.450 
output is here we've got 50 watts on two
meters<00:00:58.960> let's<00:00:59.960> go<00:01:00.230> ahead<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.239> now<00:01:02.239> let's<00:01:02.720> show

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.219 
meters let's go ahead and now let's show
virtual<00:01:04.460> sideband

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
virtual sideband

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.219 
virtual sideband
let's<00:01:06.229> show<00:01:06.409> sideband<00:01:06.950> here<00:01:08.050> let's<00:01:09.050> go<00:01:09.200> to

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
let's show sideband here let's go to

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:21.010 
let's show sideband here let's go to
mode<00:01:12.430> let's<00:01:13.430> go<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.580> USB<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.479> about<00:01:20.660> 50

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.290 
mode let's go to USB so it's about 50
out<00:01:25.899> ok<00:01:27.340> want<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.429> dummy<00:01:28.610> oh<00:01:28.729> just<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.149> you

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
out ok want a dummy oh just like you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.919 
out ok want a dummy oh just like you
know<00:01:29.420> where<00:01:29.750> we<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:30.470> are<00:01:30.649> on<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.250> dummy<00:01:31.550> load<00:01:31.929> so

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
know where we are are on a dummy load so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.919 
know where we are are on a dummy load so
let's<00:01:33.320> change<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.979> mode<00:01:34.160> again<00:01:37.479> okay<00:01:38.479> let's

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
let's change the mode again okay let's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:47.709 
let's change the mode again okay let's
go<00:01:39.259> tool

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.160 

let's<00:01:48.719> go<00:01:48.810> 250<00:01:49.020> 300<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.549> we're<00:01:50.789> on<00:01:50.909> FM<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
let's go 250 300 and we're on FM and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.730 
let's go 250 300 and we're on FM and
let's<00:01:52.649> switch<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.369> H<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> we're<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
let's switch over to H up and we're on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
let's switch over to H up and we're on
the<00:01:55.829> tour<00:01:56.039> 2<00:01:56.219> watt<00:01:56.340> scale<00:01:56.729> again<00:01:59.149> weird<00:02:00.149> about
