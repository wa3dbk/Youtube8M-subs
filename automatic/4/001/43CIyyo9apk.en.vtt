 hello today i show you her in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.170
 make origami halloween pumpkin 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.509
 so you need a piece of paper 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.000
 should be square and one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.730
 black little ones and we start 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.039
 as well as the pieces of paper and fold it that way 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:32.730
 in the middle as well lay the edge 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.579
 drive over and make it on now 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.930
 Let's take the two ends 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 the two corners better said it went 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:50.219
 to each other and kink the whole one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:01:02.960
 open it and do it on the other side 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:02.960
 exactly the same so because it &amp; manges on 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:20.220
 and now we'll do it again 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 so here's the middle of it by that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.470
 whole and we have two crosses here 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.460
 and here are two crosses now we take it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.270
 stands paper and fold is like this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.950
 both would have come together and that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 we draw here 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:55.220
 so they work hard and have them all 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:05.119
 form the one lasche and bring me 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 you to the middle line the same 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:15.770
 make me on the other side too 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:23.090
 So food now we hide 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:32.450
 the whole thing so dear and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:35.680
 even how it looks like to me this corner and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.680
 bring you to the middle 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.700
 so long on the other side exactly 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.440
 the same thing 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.250
 Now we open this up and hide 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:03.190
 the whole back again so once 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 and once it looks like we have to 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.069
 from this before 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:14.799
 come to this form and this here 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:21.400
 whole and to bend the corners by 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:26.709
 behind so always on one side and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.470
 once on the other have quite 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.540
 kinked and it looks like that 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:42.000
 so that these corners do not bend us 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:47.100
 also here so backwards and so and so 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.100

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.299

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.380
