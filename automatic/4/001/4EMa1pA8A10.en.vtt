 Blood Sweat and Photo - Your podcast about photography! 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.220
 Tokina 11-16mm f / 2.8 IFDX AT-X PRO vs Tokina 11-28mm IF FX 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.340
 Hello guys! Welcome to another video here of Blood Sweat and Photo. 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 Today I'm going to talk about these two lenses, two wide angles of the Tokina. 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.320
 That is 11-16mm f / 2.8 and 16-28mm also f / 2.8. 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.540
 If you are thinking of buying any of them ...... 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.860
 Remembering: I already made a specific video about each of them, so just click here from the side ... 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 that you go straight to each video, okay? But anyway ... 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.100
 If you are thinking of buying a wide angle and you have a cropped camera, ... 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 I do not believe you have much to think about. You'll have to buy an 11-16mm. 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.720
 Because? Because it will work like a 16-24mm in your cropped sensor camera. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.040
 Despite being an 11-16mm, it will work as if it were then 16-28mm. 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.580
 So if your camera is cropmed, again, there is not much to think about. 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.580
 It has to be 11-16mm. 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.100
 Because if you are buying at 16-28mm, it is worth continuing with the kit lens that is 18-55mm. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.840
 Because the range will be basically the same and you will be paying much less, not worth it. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.920
 Now if you as I have a full-frame sensor camera, when buying what I thought? 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.080
 "Well, life, I buy 16-28mm, which is for Full-frame, or do I buy 11-16mm for cropped sensors?" 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.640
 Because? Because all Full-frame cameras nowadays have an option to use only one part of the sensor ... 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.600
 and make it work like a cropped camera. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.680
 And so we can use camera lenses cropped in it. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.400
 So my reasoning was like? I can buy the 16-28mm, and in fact use it as 16-28mm ... 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.200
 since the 16-28mm is not for cropped camera, but for Full-frame. 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.700
 Or I can buy an 11-16mm and use my cropped shape sensor and have the same 16-28mm. 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.200
 And still, when I'm using my Nikon D90 that has sensor cropado, I can also use ... 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.560
 at 11-16mm. So I would have the same lens and could use both cameras. Right? 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.120
 But the question remained: is it the same quality? Do the lenses deliver the same sharpness? 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.780
 And that's why I did a series of images comparing the two side by side and that I will show you. 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 Come on? 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.820
 Well, at first I did some pictures to check the distortion. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.300
 I made one with the 11-16mm. You can see that there is some distortion in it at 11mm. 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.340
 And now I made one with the 16-28mm and you can see that the difference is almost nil. 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.960
 There is a small distortion as far as the 11-16mm lens, as you can see side by side. 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 I've prepared two still images and this one is just to show how far away I was ... 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 even window was too short. It should be about 50cm and the window is more than 2 meters wide. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.560
 So you can see that the distortion is really very low on both lenses. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.120
 There at 11-16mm and now at 16-28mm. 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.960
 And again, side by side, you can see that the distortion is almost the same. 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.300
 And now, very important, let's talk about sharpness now. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.400
 First a picture with the 11-16mm and then one with the 16-28mm. 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.280
 And now an image that I prepared with a small detail of each one. Where we can see clearly the sharpness. 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:50.080
 First image in f / 2.8, it is noticed that the 11-16mm takes a small advantage in relation to 16-28mm. 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.620
 This maybe due to being using the most central part of the same lens right. 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.800
 But now when we are reducing the opening, there they are becoming equal. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.980
 At apertures above f / 8, f / 11 then 16-28mm is much clearer beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.680
 Another important point is also the flare, which at wide angles tends to annoy quite a lot. 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:24.620
 At 11-16mm I think it does not bother as much as at 16-28mm as you can see in the examples. 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.840
 Note that the 11-16mm has much less flare than at 16-28mm, 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.560
 As I had said we can use the 11-16mm, which is a lens made for cropped sensors, ... 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.600
 in our Full-frame camera in crop mode. But we can also use it in Full mode. 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.400
 What will happen? There's gonna be a little vignette. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.360
 So these images that I am putting now to demonstrate. 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.900
 First with the parasol and then without the parasol. Why am I showing this? 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.480
 Because then we can use her in her full range, like an 11-16mm in fact. 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.560
 And we got even with the sticker still cool pictures that we can use it to our advantage. 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.660
 Like that's what I'm showing you now. 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.540
 Well, then and moral conclusion of the story: which of the two to buy? 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.580
 Again: if you have a cropped camera, you have nothing to think about, it has to be 11-16mm. 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.460
 Now if you have a Full-frame, then these are two options, right? 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.360
 Which one would I buy? 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.780
 Well, if you work with photography I think this is not just a purchase, it's an investment. 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.960
 So I would invest in quality, would go from 16-28mm. 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.680
 It is much more robust, much heavier and it is noticed that it is much better constructed than the 11-16mm. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Now if you photograph by hobby, if you have no profit from it and will not have financial return with this purchase, ... 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.780
 so you do not have to think, go from 11-16mm. 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.600
 Because there you can use in your Full-frame and if you have a camera cropado as second camera ... 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.040
 you will also be able to use it having a very cool range. 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.600
 Not to mention the price it is much cheaper than the 16-28mm. 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.220
 And this is personal, we have reached the end of yet another video. Hope this helps. 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.080
 Oh, and before you ask me about the EXIF ​​of the images and which ISO I used or whatever ... 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.100
 I usually make available all the images I make there in our Facebook group. 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.840
 It's not on the page, it's on the group. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.120
 So just go to Facebook, search for "Blood Sweat and Photo" that you will find our group. 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.980
 Enter there is a topic, an album that I create with all the images I put in the video, ... 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.280
 all the images I used to make this video. Right? 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.600
 This is the invitation, even if you are not interested in the images. 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.880
 Between there and participate in the group, there are some interesting discussions. Right?
