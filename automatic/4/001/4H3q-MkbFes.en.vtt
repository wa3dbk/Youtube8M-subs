00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 ivette i am a princess 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.090
 Today I managed to notice very 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.969
 interesting similarity between nightmarish 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.670
 animatronics and maybe that nightmarish 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 slaughterhouse and Freddy is one 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 animatronic who can change 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.449
 be sure to put yourself like 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.269
 want to see more videos on this game 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 and start with the fact that after its release 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.910
 second teaser for some people 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.640
 there are speculations about what a nightmare 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 Bonnie is a nightmare Freddy since they have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 both 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 sharp teeth sharp fingers and lenses 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.399
 at first sight 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 of course there are similarities between them 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 nightmare bonnie in this rabbit and nightmare 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.010
 freddie bear and it shows in the ears and in 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.379
 scott himself 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.739
 officially confirmed by the game page 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.340
 that the second teaser shows a nightmare 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 bonnie as you can see he signed it in 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.640
 overall over time, the legs understood that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.420
 the first in the teaser depicts Freddie and on 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 background 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.630
 and it is clear that animatronics are different 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 so just comparing them to each other 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 it makes no sense 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.490
 Well, in fact, my friends, you are all 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 well know that scott constantly 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.310
 leaves various puzzles which is not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 but everyone can find friends for me 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 managed to do it and remember all the theories 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 my personal 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.930
 and personally my guesses and that nightmarish 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.119
 animatronics baths and Freddie found such 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 similarity which confirms the fact 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 that the nightmarish freddie can change himself 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.520
 and perhaps the most real 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.859
 a werewolf that is according to this similarity 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.770
 it can be concluded that the game will be 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:56.259
 one nightmarish animatronic which 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.369
 will be able to completely change their appearance 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.009
 and now my friends will show this similarity 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.770
 so look carefully first 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.959
 nightmare freddy's teaser on top 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.780
 parts of the right hand missing part 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.120
 hull and seen and on the skeleton and now 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.519
 look at the second teaser spanie here 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.849
 also shows the upper part of the right hand 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can see that he, too, from the level 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.030
 part of the body as you can see scott 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.370
 specially zamylil this place to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.739
 it was impossible to guess all good 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.560
 consider but even though scott 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.900
 soiled his hand you can see that 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.160
 hijack damage from exactly the same part 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.319
 hull let's take a closer look at how 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.780
 see in two different animatronics a 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.049
 right hand who is already the place itself 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.440
 torn off the fate of the upholstery well how are you 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.139
 understand this is impossible so it means 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.230
 felling of the same animatronic 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.680
 who just changed his appearance but 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.290
 not completely certain parts of the body such 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.480
 how the extra part of his hand Avito remained 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.519
 same now so that you are completely 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.790
 make sure that the upper arm 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.330
 look at a few of the same 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.670
 obvious matches 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.700
 if it didnâ€™t see you then right 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.270
 the contour is completely in view of the flock for an hour 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.450
 shells 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.470
 as you can see the part that is missing 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.680
 both animatronics form absolutely 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.050
 identical therefore it only remains 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.480
 two options first is 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.420
 what a nightmarish animatronic really 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.910
 one and he can take on the face of any 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.000
 animatronics and to this completely 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.480
 made sure look at the next teaser 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.910
 which is likely to be nightmarish 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.160
 check and if she has the upper arm 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.050
 will be the same animatronic 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.770
 really will be 1 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.290
 and my theory will be confirmed also 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.810
 there is a second option which is 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
 is that scott when creating nightmarish 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.140
 animatronics 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.440
 uses the same model just 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.710
 changes some parts of the body and on teaser 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.560
 it shows the initial model and therefore 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.020
 flunked and some places and only then 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.989
 scott every nightmarish animatronics 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.980
 make your model and their hands will be 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.350
 differ 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.110
 and how do you think you are friends which of these 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.800
 options do you think would be 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.020
 true to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.920
 write about it in the comments below 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.000
 video as well as write your options 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.350
 tell about this video with all your 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.930
 friends and acquaintances 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.240
 be sure to put likes join 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.130
 my group in contact subscribe to 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.060
 my channel is happy and wait for the following 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.060
