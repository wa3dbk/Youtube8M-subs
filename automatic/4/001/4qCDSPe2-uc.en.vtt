00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
part of that and we we realized that

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.710 
part of that and we we realized that
people<00:04:30.830> learn<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.580> different<00:04:31.640> ways<00:04:32.240> some

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
people learn in different ways some

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.130 
people learn in different ways some
people<00:04:32.750> are<00:04:33.230> content<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.710> read<00:04:33.980> labels<00:04:34.250> and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
people are content to read labels and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
process information that way but a lot

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.960

of<00:04:38.090> people<00:04:38.740> value<00:04:39.740> technology<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.610> help<00:04:40.760> them

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
of people value technology to help them

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.120 
of people value technology to help them
understand<00:04:41.570> pieces<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.140> so<00:04:42.320> we<00:04:42.590> have<00:04:42.830> used

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
understand pieces and so we have used

that<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.370> think<00:04:43.760> in<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:44.000> very<00:04:44.030> good<00:04:44.450> way<00:04:44.600> of

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
that I think in a very good way of

screens in front of it where the image
is<00:05:01.640> displayed<00:05:01.700> on<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.630> computer<00:05:02.780> screens<00:05:03.320> and

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
is displayed on the computer screens and

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.980 
is displayed on the computer screens and
people<00:05:03.620> are<00:05:03.860> able<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.220> touch<00:05:04.640> various<00:05:05.510> areas
