found something there a forerunner relic

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180 
found something there a forerunner relic
and<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> they're<00:00:34.380> investigating<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and so they're investigating that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470 
and so they're investigating that
because<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.850> always<00:00:36.270> extremely

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
because there is always extremely

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
because there is always extremely
interesting<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.620> anything<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.190> runner<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
interesting in anything for runner and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
interesting in anything for runner and
you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.809> ship<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.290> spirit<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.620> fire<00:00:40.739> has

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you know our ship the spirit of fire has

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350 
you know our ship the spirit of fire has
been<00:00:41.010> sent<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> investigate<00:00:41.700> since<00:00:42.090> that's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
been sent to investigate since that's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
been sent to investigate since that's
where<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> story<00:00:42.690> starts<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> ways

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
where the story starts one of the ways

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.590 
where the story starts one of the ways
we<00:00:44.309> tell<00:00:44.520> story<00:00:44.760> differently<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we tell story differently than the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119 
we tell story differently than the
inhaler<00:00:46.050> first<00:00:46.200> person<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> halo

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
inhaler first person to this is the halo

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.529 
inhaler first person to this is the halo
first<00:00:47.370> doesn't<00:00:47.670> she<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.149> Master

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
first doesn't she was all about Master

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
first doesn't she was all about Master
Chief<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.020> he's<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> hero<00:00:49.649> character<00:00:50.190> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
Chief so he's the hero character so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
Chief so he's the hero character so
inhaler<00:00:51.000> wars<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> group<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
inhaler wars we actually have a group of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.660 
inhaler wars we actually have a group of
characters<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.280> real<00:00:53.489> time

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
characters because you know real time

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.510 
characters because you know real time
strategy<00:00:53.879> game<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.129> group

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
strategy game and so it's actually group

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.500 
strategy game and so it's actually group

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
when we did add you know actual units

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.330 
when we did add you know actual units
say<00:03:06.570> we<00:03:06.720> added<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> Wolverine<00:03:07.500> which<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.100> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
say we added the Wolverine which is you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
say we added the Wolverine which is you
know<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.730> UNSC<00:03:09.210> anti-air<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.350> play

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
know the UNSC anti-air you get to play

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.440 
know the UNSC anti-air you get to play
halo<00:03:10.740> wars<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.490> came<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.940> reasons<00:03:12.120> why

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
halo wars we came up with reasons why

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.660 
halo wars we came up with reasons why
it's<00:03:12.600> not<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.930> halo<00:03:13.110> 1<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.530> mean<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.130> factory

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's not in halo 1 I mean that factory

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.310 
it's not in halo 1 I mean that factory
was<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:15.000> Mars<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.690> fighting<00:03:15.930> out<00:03:16.110> that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
was on Mars and that fighting out that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.290 
was on Mars and that fighting out that
that<00:03:16.500> factory<00:03:16.920> was<00:03:17.070> bombed<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.610> year<00:03:17.790> 25

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
that factory was bombed in the year 25

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.480 
that factory was bombed in the year 25
35<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> was<00:03:19.500> completely<00:03:19.830> annihilated

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
35 so it was completely annihilated

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.740 
35 so it was completely annihilated
that's<00:03:20.700> why<00:03:20.850> there's<00:03:21.030> no<00:03:21.120> more<00:03:21.300> Wolverines

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that's why there's no more Wolverines

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.170 
that's why there's no more Wolverines
and<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.070> um<00:03:23.280> each<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> things<00:03:24.060> we

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and so it's um each of the things we

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.880 
and so it's um each of the things we
actually<00:03:24.270> insert<00:03:24.840> into<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.290> universe<00:03:25.620> we

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
actually insert into the universe we

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.800 
actually insert into the universe we
actually<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.550> know<00:03:26.640> felt<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.540> made<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
actually you know felt that we made it

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.240 
actually you know felt that we made it
realistic<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.410> wheel<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.130> actually

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
realistic and wheel that we actually

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.250 
realistic and wheel that we actually
match<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.790> cannon<00:03:30.090> made<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> bit<00:03:30.600> neon<00:03:30.870> and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
match the cannon made a bit neon and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.890 
match the cannon made a bit neon and
maybe<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.680> actually<00:03:32.070> part<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.970> halo<00:03:33.240> halo

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
maybe it's actually part of halo halo

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.280 
maybe it's actually part of halo halo
