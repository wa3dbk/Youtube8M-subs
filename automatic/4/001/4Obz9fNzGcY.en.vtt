right all right good let's get started
obviously<00:01:05.500> there<00:01:05.740> are<00:01:05.830> things<00:01:05.860> you're<00:01:06.160> gonna

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
obviously there are things you're gonna

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.980 
obviously there are things you're gonna
need<00:01:06.550> before<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.270> actually<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.690> go<00:01:07.840> and

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
need before you actually just go and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.200 
need before you actually just go and
throw<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.230> back<00:01:08.440> handspring<00:01:08.890> some<00:01:09.610> people<00:01:09.910> can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
throw a back handspring some people can

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.700 
throw a back handspring some people can
go<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.390> just<00:01:10.750> throw<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> back<00:01:11.050> handspring<00:01:11.440> I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
go and just throw a back handspring I

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
go and just throw a back handspring I
was<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.190> one<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.430> those<00:01:12.550> people

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.460 

you<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> no<00:01:22.440> idea<00:01:22.470> hardest<00:01:23.190> thing<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you have no idea hardest thing when you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
you have no idea hardest thing when you
go<00:01:28.590> backwards<00:01:28.980> make<00:01:29.700> sure<00:01:29.910> you<00:01:30.090> sit<00:01:30.330> back<00:01:30.510> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
go backwards make sure you sit back like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.880 
go backwards make sure you sit back like
you're<00:01:30.900> about<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.080> sit<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.410> chair<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:31.770> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you're about to sit in a chair and I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.740 
you're about to sit in a chair and I
know<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.310> scary<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.090> backward

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
know it's scary but that backward

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.900 
know it's scary but that backward
momentum<00:01:34.230> is<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.490> backwards

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
momentum is gonna make you go backwards

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.810 
momentum is gonna make you go backwards
and<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.620> lot<00:01:38.010> easier<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and it's gonna make it a lot easier to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.970 
and it's gonna make it a lot easier to
go<00:01:38.940> backwards<00:01:39.300> you<00:01:40.020> need<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> skill

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
go backwards you need to do the skill

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.860 
go backwards you need to do the skill
downhill<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.490> mean<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:42.000> means<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.720> not

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
downhill I mean by all means that's not

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.660 
downhill I mean by all means that's not
cheating<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.770> teaching<00:01:44.160> yourself

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
cheating you're teaching yourself

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
cheating you're teaching yourself
so<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.840> downhill<00:01:46.110> until<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> feel

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
so do it downhill until you feel

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.660 
so do it downhill until you feel
comfortable<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.220> try<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.520> flat

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
comfortable and then try it on flat

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
comfortable and then try it on flat
ground<00:01:47.910> okay<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.050> back<00:01:49.230> make

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
ground okay so when you go back make

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
ground okay so when you go back make
sure<00:01:49.500> you're<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.830> throwing<00:01:50.070> your<00:01:50.310> head<00:01:50.460> back

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
sure you're not throwing your head back

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.120 
sure you're not throwing your head back
make<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.780> doesn't<00:01:51.900> look<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.590> for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
make sure it doesn't look like this for

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.480 
make sure it doesn't look like this for
instance<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.820> mean<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.780> ugly<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
instance I mean that's just ugly and the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
instance I mean that's just ugly and the
problem<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:56.970> was<00:01:57.150> I<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.650> not<00:01:58.830> sitting

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
problem with that was I was not sitting

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.440 
problem with that was I was not sitting
back<00:01:59.220> far<00:01:59.460> enough<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.150> sit<00:02:00.330> back

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
back far enough if you do not sit back

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.490 
back far enough if you do not sit back
far<00:02:00.630> enough<00:02:00.660> you're<00:02:01.050> gonna<00:02:01.170> look<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.350> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
far enough you're gonna look like that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.719 
far enough you're gonna look like that
and<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.890> gonna<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.280> ugly

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and it's gonna be really ugly

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.750 
and it's gonna be really ugly
we<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.450> want<00:02:03.630> ugly<00:02:03.960> skills<00:02:04.520> next<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
we don't want ugly skills next when you

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.980 
we don't want ugly skills next when you
go<00:02:05.850> backwards<00:02:06.210> try<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.509> point<00:02:06.690> your<00:02:06.810> toes<00:02:06.960> and
