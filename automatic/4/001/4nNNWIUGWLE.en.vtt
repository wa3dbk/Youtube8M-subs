with<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.320> same<00:00:33.500> swing<00:00:35.110> now<00:00:36.110> watch<00:00:36.320> this

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
with the same swing now watch this

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.619 
with the same swing now watch this
it's<00:00:37.430> my<00:00:37.610> horizontal<00:00:37.879> back<00:00:38.300> swing<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
it's my horizontal back swing and

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.540 
it's my horizontal back swing and
vertical<00:00:39.290> follow-through<00:00:39.860> pitching<00:00:40.280> swing

vertical follow-through pitching swing
and<00:00:40.790> I'm<00:00:41.270> going<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.510> use<00:00:41.720> it<00:00:41.900> with<00:00:42.080> four<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.680> my

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and I'm going to use it with four of my

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.450 
and I'm going to use it with four of my
Rotex<00:00:43.340> 2.0<00:00:44.000> wedges<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:45.010> 64<00:00:46.010> degree<00:00:46.250> wedge

Rotex 2.0 wedges a 64 degree wedge

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.060 
Rotex 2.0 wedges a 64 degree wedge
produces<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.120> super<00:00:47.510> soft<00:00:47.750> lob<00:00:48.019> which<00:00:48.739> carries

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
produces a super soft lob which carries

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.880 
produces a super soft lob which carries
most<00:00:49.309> of<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.610> way<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.030> stops<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.510> quickest

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
most of the way and stops the quickest

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.070 
most of the way and stops the quickest
my<00:00:51.890> 60-degree<00:00:52.610> produces<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> normal<00:00:53.600> lob<00:00:53.780> shot

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
my 60-degree produces a normal lob shot

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.810 
my 60-degree produces a normal lob shot
that<00:00:54.320> carries<00:00:54.620> roughly<00:00:55.010> three-quarters<00:00:55.670> of

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
that carries roughly three-quarters of

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.570 
that carries roughly three-quarters of
75%<00:00:56.330> of<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.839> way<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:57.409> pin<00:00:57.650> then<00:00:58.129> runs<00:00:58.400> out

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
75% of the way to the pin then runs out

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.600 
75% of the way to the pin then runs out
a<00:00:58.610> bit<00:00:58.850> my<00:00:59.690> 56<00:01:00.049> degree<00:01:00.589> produces<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.159> standard

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
a bit my 56 degree produces a standard

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.090 
a bit my 56 degree produces a standard
pitch<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.059> runs<00:01:02.239> out<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.449> little<00:01:02.659> more<00:01:03.100> and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
pitch that runs out a little more and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.850 
pitch that runs out a little more and
finally<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.120> use<00:01:05.180> my<00:01:05.540> 50<00:01:05.870> degree<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.500> running

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
finally I use my 50 degree for a running

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.830 
finally I use my 50 degree for a running
pitch<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.610> carries<00:01:07.970> roughly<00:01:08.299> halfway<00:01:08.780> to

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
pitch this carries roughly halfway to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.730 
pitch this carries roughly halfway to
the<00:01:09.110> hole<00:01:09.320> then<00:01:09.860> runs<00:01:10.130> out<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.490> other<00:01:10.610> half

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
the hole then runs out the other half

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.320 
the hole then runs out the other half
the<00:01:12.740> key<00:01:12.950> thing<00:01:13.220> here<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:13.970> use<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the key thing here is that I use the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.780 
the key thing here is that I use the
same<00:01:14.600> standard<00:01:15.110> swing<00:01:15.380> on<00:01:15.680> all<00:01:16.159> four<00:01:16.490> shots

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
same standard swing on all four shots

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.300 
same standard swing on all four shots
it's<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.390> same<00:01:17.780> pitching<00:01:18.470> swing<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:18.920> very

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
it's the same pitching swing it's very

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.459 
it's the same pitching swing it's very
simple<00:01:19.729> it's<00:01:20.210> just<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.750> little<00:01:21.110> bit<00:01:21.229> past

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
simple it's just a little bit past

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.920 
simple it's just a little bit past
horizontal<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.969> and<00:01:23.270> I'm<00:01:23.390> talking<00:01:23.659> about<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
horizontal so and I'm talking about the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.069 
horizontal so and I'm talking about the
shaft<00:01:24.280> that's<00:01:25.280> my<00:01:25.520> back<00:01:25.729> swing<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.600> all<00:01:26.780> four

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
shaft that's my back swing with all four

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.770 
shaft that's my back swing with all four
of<00:01:27.109> them<00:01:27.289> and<00:01:27.439> I<00:01:28.039> try<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.700> take<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:29.240> finish

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
of them and I try to take my finish

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.830 
of them and I try to take my finish
through<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.619> vertical

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.750 

it's<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.960> thing<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.260> beauty<00:01:36.710> one<00:01:36.950> swing<00:01:37.250> four

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
it's a thing of beauty one swing four

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's a thing of beauty one swing four
shots<00:01:38.090> this<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.900> because<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.350> have<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.710> properly

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
shots this is because I have a properly

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.190 
shots this is because I have a properly
fit<00:01:40.460> set<00:01:40.730> of<00:01:40.820> wedges<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.270> when<00:01:42.080> I'm

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
fit set of wedges and when I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.410 
fit set of wedges and when I'm
practicing<00:01:42.380> with<00:01:42.830> one<00:01:43.010> club<00:01:43.250> I'm<00:01:43.490> practicing

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
practicing with one club I'm practicing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.510 
practicing with one club I'm practicing
with<00:01:44.540> them<00:01:44.660> all<00:01:44.810> if<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.860> practice<00:01:46.370> these

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
with them all if you practice these

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.940 
with them all if you practice these
shots<00:01:46.820> enough<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.480> fly<00:01:47.990> them<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.320> consistent

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
shots enough and fly them on consistent

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.830 
shots enough and fly them on consistent
trajectories<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:50.360> get<00:01:50.540> your<00:01:50.660> wedge

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
trajectories and you get your wedge

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.570 
trajectories and you get your wedge
setup<00:01:51.200> right<00:01:51.380> you'll<00:01:52.190> leave<00:01:52.370> yourself

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
setup right you'll leave yourself

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.000 
setup right you'll leave yourself
shorter<00:01:53.270> putts<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:54.380> means<00:01:54.710> lower

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
shorter putts and that means lower

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:07.200 
shorter putts and that means lower
scores

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the pressures on your stroke will be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.600 
the pressures on your stroke will be
made<00:02:17.540> out<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.810> habit<00:02:17.960> now<00:02:18.770> here's<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> bad<00:02:19.250> habit
