trader joes multigrain baking and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
trader joes multigrain baking and
pancake<00:00:52.710> mix<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> use<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pancake mix you don't have to use this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.049 
pancake mix you don't have to use this
you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> actually<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.260> regular<00:00:56.059> whole

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you can actually just use regular whole

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
you can actually just use regular whole
wheat<00:00:57.210> flour<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.140> either<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.649> works<00:00:58.800> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
wheat flour so either one works just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
wheat flour so either one works just
fine<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.820> whole<00:01:00.000> wheat<00:01:00.149> flour<00:01:00.390> instead<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
fine the whole wheat flour instead of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
fine the whole wheat flour instead of
the<00:01:01.649> baking<00:01:02.010> mix<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the baking mix like this will make it a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
the baking mix like this will make it a
little<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.199> dense<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.460> mean<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
little more dense but I mean the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.179 
little more dense but I mean the
difference<00:01:05.970> isn't<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.540> big<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> deal<00:01:07.189> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
difference isn't that big of a deal so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.109 
difference isn't that big of a deal so
then<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> add<00:01:10.189> 2<00:01:11.189> tbsp<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.909> mix

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
then you want to add 2 tbsp of the mix

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.109 
then you want to add 2 tbsp of the mix
and<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.750> sure<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.110> whole<00:01:16.320> grain<00:01:16.350> because

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
and make sure it's whole grain because

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.450 
and make sure it's whole grain because
you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> worry<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.560> cards<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you know when you worry about cards and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
you know when you worry about cards and
simple<00:01:20.850> carbs<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> green<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.170> always

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
simple carbs and green it's always

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840 
simple carbs and green it's always
better<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.890> whole<00:01:23.100> grain<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> much<00:01:23.700> as

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
better do whole grain as much as

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
better do whole grain as much as
possible<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> okay<00:01:27.560> okay<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.770> 2<00:01:29.040> tablespoons

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
and I cook it a little slower just to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.500 
and I cook it a little slower just to
make<00:03:28.110> sure<00:03:28.730> everything<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.760> cooked<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.299> it's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
make sure everything is cooked and it's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.690 
make sure everything is cooked and it's
not<00:03:30.690> like<00:03:30.840> any<00:03:31.110> softness<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.040> middle<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
not like any softness in the middle and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.259 
not like any softness in the middle and
once<00:03:33.329> it's<00:03:33.510> getting<00:03:33.810> close<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.110> being<00:03:34.560> ready

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
once it's getting close to being ready

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.120 
once it's getting close to being ready
it'll<00:03:36.269> bubble<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.440> kind<00:03:38.010> of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
it'll bubble up like that and kind of

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.210 
it'll bubble up like that and kind of
get<00:03:38.280> dry<00:03:38.670> looking<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.010> pancake<00:03:41.010> and

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
get dry looking on the pancake and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949 
get dry looking on the pancake and
that's<00:03:41.430> how<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.760> know<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.299> it's<00:03:42.450> time<00:03:42.720> to

pancakes cook and then i'll show you how
I<00:04:47.810> top<00:04:48.080> them<00:04:48.260> off<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.460> go<00:04:49.610> there<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.180> go<00:04:50.360> you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
I top them off so to go there you go you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.110 
I top them off so to go there you go you
have<00:04:50.720> pancakes<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.680> they<00:04:52.520> are<00:04:52.699> really<00:04:53.000> good

they are low carb pancakes and I Ryan

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.150 
they are low carb pancakes and I Ryan
protein<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:57.020> this<00:04:57.740> would<00:04:57.889> be<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:58.010> good

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
protein so this would be a good

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.680 
protein so this would be a good
breakfast<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.669> have<00:04:58.820> after<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> workout

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
breakfast to have after a workout

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.659 
breakfast to have after a workout
because<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:01.400> should<00:05:01.820> after<00:05:03.310> doing<00:05:04.310> high

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
because you should after doing high

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.279 
because you should after doing high
impact<00:05:05.410> exercise<00:05:07.030> you're<00:05:08.030> supposed<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.600> have

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
impact exercise you're supposed to have

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.219 
impact exercise you're supposed to have
protein<00:05:09.949> within<00:05:10.310> an<00:05:10.729> hour<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.449> exercise

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
protein within an hour of the exercise

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.560 
protein within an hour of the exercise
because<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.099> replenishes<00:05:13.490> your<00:05:13.820> muscles<00:05:14.300> and

rebuild your muscles and building muscle

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.719 
rebuild your muscles and building muscle
means<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.930> muscles<00:05:18.349> burn<00:05:18.530> fat<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.490> is

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
means that muscles burn fat and that is

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.710 
means that muscles burn fat and that is
a<00:05:19.760> good<00:05:20.180> thing<00:05:20.360> so<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.110> either<00:05:22.060> I'll<00:05:23.060> go<00:05:23.330> running
