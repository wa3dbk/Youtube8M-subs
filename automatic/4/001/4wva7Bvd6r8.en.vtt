00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.680
 . overview 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.790
 hello internet resource mega review 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.070
 dot com provides to your attention 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.700
 regular budget model of the company 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.300
 megaphone 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.540
 This is a smartphone megaphone login device 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.809
 here comes in such a small box 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.700
 black and green as you can 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.280
 see here is nothing special so 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.809
 drawn 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 you can only see the complete set 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:52.350
 devices so open the box inside 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 is the smartphone itself 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 charger 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 headset 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.110
 user manual and in it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.930
 warranty card 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:19.990
 ja-de, in principle, equipment such 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 standard let's consider it ourselves 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.350
 smartphone that will cost buyers 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 about two and a half thousand 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.480
 rubles 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.430
 very cheap here it is so small 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.130
 size 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.280
 3 touch buttons front button 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.390
 return to the previous page 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.240
 back button on the main page and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.130
 in the entry to the settings here as well 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.210
 button most likely she just 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 used to improve the design she 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.940
 also performs a return to or 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 turning on the device so well that is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.330
 the screen turns on 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.320
 here is a speaker near so 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.130
 go above 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.730
 here the speaker on top is the power button and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 headset jack 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.190
 below as you can see there is nothing 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 left side connector for charger 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.650
 devices with a right side button 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 volume control as you can 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.500
 notice immediately here a connector for removal 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.410
 back cover and here is a strip beat 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.810
 Silver is back 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:48.239
 cameras with speaker and so back case 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.239
 opens now start turn off 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.920
 well the lid keeps tight even 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.070
 opens normally and so here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.320
 is the battery principle for 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:15.480
 budget model very good 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.180
 We get here a slot for a sim card and a slot 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:26.520
 for memory card 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:30.390
 however, the design is made like this to me 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.110
 This design does not like so 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.110
 shove back 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.850
 turn on 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.989
 as you can see the display 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:56.500
 covered with a protective film which can 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:59.120
 dial in the club is the principle of sensor 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.750
 pretty is not bad but as soon as I can 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.109
 say that the bottom three touch buttons 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.359
 sometimes it starts to fail and you have to 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.140
 so many times to press as they 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:15.170
 react poorly to pressing the viewing angle 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.350
 very bad meaning everything is clear 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.889
 see you have to look exactly under 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.870
 90 degree angle 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:28.070
 standard android version 40 update 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.740
 does not come out just flashing 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.620
 which weighs about two hundred megabytes 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.620
 but it still remains android 4 0 4 all 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 positions goes on in principle in the standard 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.199
 principle here you can see that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.030
 There is a news feed mail.ru that is 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.289
 when you connect to the internet she 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:55.550
 the tape starts to work and changes 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.970
 there you can click to take and read here 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.289
 main basic program play market 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.550
 and you can put yourself all 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.650
 navigation go menu 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.650
 that is, everything is standard 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.430
 as I said the whole android 4 0 4 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:31.090
 memory is not so much 4 gigabytes 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.680
 RAM 512 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:39.889
 the principle of the place of display is that only two 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:45.610
 two also pour support 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.610
 sit sit cards up to 32 gigabytes 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.270
 sound device is not particularly different then 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.229
 there are various kinds of music listening to music 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.310
 that is, you can hardly enjoy and 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.599
 get some pleasure in 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.129
 the principle of a speedy device 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:05.590
 designed for the internet to 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.199
 delve into the networks 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.460
 download something to watch so 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:16.699
 Let's see the tests in the benchmark device 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.639
 Scored a decent enough principle 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.469
 number of points for such a model 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.110
 I will remind that it will bypass all two with 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:28.449
 half a thousand rubles rather all this 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:32.680
 the cheapest budget model which 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.680
 pretty decent functionality 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.399
 at the same time the device supports up to 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:44.049
 2 touches 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:47.649
 there is a map navigator but everything is according to the standard 

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:50.349
 principle camera device in daylight 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:54.939
 time of day works more so 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:57.159
 ok most likely this is due to 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.339
 what I lack autofocus 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:01.839
 but at night the camera cameras 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:05.289
 you can not use it at all because 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:08.349
 the frame turns out just awful and so in 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:15.209
 the whole device turned out very 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:19.479
 not bad megaphone once again pleased his 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:22.119
 customers a new smartphone model which 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:24.909
 hit the budget segment thanks for 

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:26.399
 attention subscribe to our channel but 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:30.069
 write and utility 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:32.439
 among them can you get lost but alone 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:34.590
 can not be visited to knowledge 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:39.210
 useful to gain 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.210
