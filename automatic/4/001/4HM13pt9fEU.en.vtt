00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
just like you know shun the oil I was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.700 
just like you know shun the oil I was
more<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> carbohydrate<00:00:48.809> thing<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
more on a carbohydrate thing so that you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.080 
more on a carbohydrate thing so that you
know<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> Drive<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.610> calories<00:00:50.879> from

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
know I Drive all the calories from

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
know I Drive all the calories from
carbohydrates<00:00:51.770> instead<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> deriving<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
carbohydrates instead of deriving it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880 
carbohydrates instead of deriving it
from<00:00:53.370> fats<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> had<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
from fats so I had to you know just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.459 
from fats so I had to you know just
switch<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.610> lean<00:00:57.480> food

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
switch to a very lean food

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.399 
switch to a very lean food
fat-free<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> oil-free<00:01:04.909> well<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:07.110> tip

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
fat-free and oil-free well the first tip

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
fat-free and oil-free well the first tip
which<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.920> kept<00:01:08.549> me<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.000> shape<00:01:09.479> since<00:01:09.750> very

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
which has kept me in shape since very

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.890 
which has kept me in shape since very
long<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> eat<00:01:10.950> only<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.460> hungry

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
long is that eat only when you're hungry

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
long is that eat only when you're hungry
secondly<00:01:13.549> trying<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> balanced

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
secondly trying to make a balanced

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
secondly trying to make a balanced
carbohydrates<00:01:15.780> fats<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> proteins

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
carbohydrates fats and proteins

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.640 
carbohydrates fats and proteins
you<00:01:17.520> should<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.119> idea<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:19.170> contains

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you should have an idea what contains

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.450 
you should have an idea what contains
fat<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.189> contains<00:01:20.610> carbohydrates<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
fat what contains carbohydrates and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
fat what contains carbohydrates and
thirdly<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:26.220> work<00:01:27.180> according<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> what

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
thirdly I think work according to what

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
thirdly I think work according to what
you<00:01:28.170> eat<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> wreck<00:01:30.180> shop<00:01:30.329> Ola<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you eat so if I'm a wreck shop Ola you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
you eat so if I'm a wreck shop Ola you
know<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.380> manual<00:01:31.680> labor<00:01:31.860> I'll<00:01:32.490> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
know I have to do manual labor I'll have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
know I have to do manual labor I'll have
a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> carbohydrates<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.509> 60%<00:01:33.840> cowboy

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
a lot of carbohydrates like 60% cowboy

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
a lot of carbohydrates like 60% cowboy
boots<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> lot<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> food<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.630> am

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
boots and lot of food and if I am

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
boots and lot of food and if I am
probably<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> banker<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.860> sit<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> day<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
probably a banker I sit all the day in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
probably a banker I sit all the day in
front<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.810> computer<00:01:40.409> I'll

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
front of a you know computer I'll

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.649 
front of a you know computer I'll
probably<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.340> salads<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.450> provide

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
probably have salads which don't provide

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
probably have salads which don't provide
much<00:01:42.720> calories<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.159> provide

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
much calories but they do provide

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.050
