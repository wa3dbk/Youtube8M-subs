00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.440
 all that is in front of there are 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.600
 of old living swamps actually doing that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.860
 see a lot more to the structure we're going 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.990
 see earlier that all 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.770
 dikes actually went missing there is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.539
 facing a flora of salt meadow and this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 pre-salt flower so has colonized all 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.770
 the old salt marshes so that's 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.130
 a walk around the salt marshes 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.180
 with the history of its salt marshes 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 who all have a story 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.340
 different was economically speaking 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 very important for the peninsula to a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.989
 certain time 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.019
 in any case until the 1950s 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 so here we are on a ski rehabilitate 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.579
 so restart early we are on 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.699
 the seventh year is you redo on 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 six almost eight hectares by the way according 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.969
 the tides can also be passed on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.859
 the island of cups conquered an island that is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.909
 accessible at low tide it's really 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.620
 use the bike to go see 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.870
 landscape ie 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's not the race we take the time 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 time we stop exhausting interest it's 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 to make them discover in fact 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.259
 places that might not necessarily 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.400
 discover the one we left from here 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.649
 there the saint dovecote we made the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.020
 marsh of du r it is reassembled in fact 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.140
 he made lille 2 cups tale 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 to the end the salt that harvests and the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 wind right away where he stored milk 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.690
 at a time when only one year remains 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.330
 that is to say that the salt that we saw 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.350
 under the mules have everything in their own way of 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.300
 tarpaulins have been called that of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.649
 lines we do not know salt 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:42.810
 it is the salt that has been harvested the year 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:45.060
 from before it dries like that it is created 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 very quickly a connection between people 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.600
 so by sharing this nature 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.800
 of this landscape and that's it's always 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800
 fairly user-friendly exits
