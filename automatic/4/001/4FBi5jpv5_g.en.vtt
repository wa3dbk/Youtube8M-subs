00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.550
 New lines are not written 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.940
 When I try to slice it, it's the type that causes it. 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.560
 It was raining in the morning before I had more coffee in the house 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.119

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.300

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.250
 Where is the place 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.190
 Baseball is not just to commentator Rising 2 minutes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.870
 I can use it to take off the fort . 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.190
 Former Korean baseball commissioner 3000, and now a Korean baseball commentator 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.729
 Please. 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.909
 You know this digitally famous. 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:58.030
 Oo 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:03.909
 What is your favorite fare haneungeot error is now far waenya's a necessity to me. 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:08.049
 Now what do I attend a lot of mounting rattling around in a raised hammer in one year 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.430
 I can almost see a part of my body diet in a car. 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:16.180
 What little we have a lot less black hot and a lot of black dots 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.920
 It 's a lot of car shape. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.160
 Let's just make a tag tag tea. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.650
 Its putty shape 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.760
 The roommate for the grooming company is Audi a5 rainy day, 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 It's very clean. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.800
 4 5 In the first half of this year, about 600 people in Korea have been wandering. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.320
 Can I give Mr. Audi a wagon and an example? 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.320
 I saw a luxury car with ample interior space. 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.629
 Because I do listen to a lot of chagu life a little like I BOY mildeon 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.030
 hurry 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:08.790
 When the first impression is just right, a leader is comfortable 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:14.060
 If the car is a little underneath, it's a little squat. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.060
 Either way, I seem to have a japsori This is more than the body 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:26.430
 I am frustrated with the fact that the dense process specialties are the situation of the other. 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.209
 Going fishing charter city is originally query 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.420
 I also met Singer 1 and Singer 1. 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.129
 Your usual thoughts about cars are very different. 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.510
 See full filled just can not pass if the difference is more than the active agents to 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:47.340
 And one should not have any results without a healer special care as usual 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.480
 It came out as if wondering whether there's under authoritarian control 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:57.810
 Only by car, and they'll authoritarian authoritative part of us see and yet 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:02.939
 There is one centralized part, which is the fact that as a sports person, 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.120
 Does the citizen with considerable jinx include visibility? 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.750
 So, you are very sensitive to the car. 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.950
 And still another one of the things that attracted half weeks at heart they have 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.949
 Included 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:21.180
 Conservative 2, and for the tourist part of the game, 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:25.860
 That's why I think you're put in quite a bit so psychologically meaningful 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.970
 I will be honored and cleaned up. 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:34.729
 If the artist flowers are also fairly young , 5 seconds 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:39.930
 So I have a sense of liberty and formality , 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:45.180
 I do not like what I like, but it's a bit like cancer for a gray book. 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.220
 But the color itself itself is the color of pain in Seoul. 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.770
 It's appealing now. 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.510
 The personality of its own distinct something. So something of the prime minister ah hostages 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.460
 And thereby also the likelihood 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.470
 That is why artists usually do not want to appeal their psychology 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.190
 The people who talk about it 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.389
 But I know they pride themselves in the river significantly 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:13.830
 We therefore very difficult people to check on that part 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.990
 Then you auto-minute interview with the psychology of people do just the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.820
 Are you fine with pretty courtyard 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.360
 I can not deny that it's true that the wait for a second interview that comes to oblivion 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.520
 It's work. 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.289
 In fact, what we do is the interview and his job. 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:36.680
 And right now the authoritative part of the same people gotta Familia and 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.680
 The inclusion of spiritual parts as well as human parts
