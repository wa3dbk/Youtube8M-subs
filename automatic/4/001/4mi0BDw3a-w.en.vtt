let's<00:04:21.639> thought<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.540> transition<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.169> actually

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
let's thought the transition is actually

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.500 
let's thought the transition is actually
a<00:04:24.610> bit<00:04:25.540> slow<00:04:25.830> work<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.130> coming<00:04:27.280> out<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:28.330> it

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
a bit slow work that is coming out is it

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.210 
a bit slow work that is coming out is it
going<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.780> be<00:04:28.870> by<00:04:29.020> Lakota<00:04:29.440> people<00:04:29.620> people

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
going to be by Lakota people people

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.430 
going to be by Lakota people people
that's<00:04:30.490> why<00:04:30.729> we<00:04:31.000> were<00:04:31.240> launched<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.840> order<00:04:32.260> to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
that's why we were launched in order to

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.850 
that's why we were launched in order to
another

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
another

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.950 
another
immediately<00:04:33.490> or<00:04:33.820> silica<00:04:34.240> we<00:04:34.389> still<00:04:34.660> want<00:04:34.930> to

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
immediately or silica we still want to

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.780 
immediately or silica we still want to
improve<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.800> response<00:04:36.190> time<00:04:36.430> right<00:04:36.610> now

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
improve the response time right now
