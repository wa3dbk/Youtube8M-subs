to<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.390> i<00:00:21.660> built<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> engine<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.619> how

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to you how i built the engine and how

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
to you how i built the engine and how
it's<00:00:22.949> supposed<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> run<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.050> not

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it's supposed to run right now it is not

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.300 
it's supposed to run right now it is not
complete<00:00:26.510> needs<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.720> more<00:00:27.750> flywheel<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.740> I'm

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
complete needs one more flywheel and I'm

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
complete needs one more flywheel and I'm
just<00:00:29.519> starting<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> fuelling<00:00:30.510> test<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
just starting on the fuelling test but I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010 
just starting on the fuelling test but I
do<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:31.710> combustion<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
do that first combustion so I'm going to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.680 
do that first combustion so I'm going to
go<00:00:34.140> over<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.030> show<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.510> first

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
go over and show you the first

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
go over and show you the first
combustion<00:00:37.380> which<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.890> really

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
combustion which is not really

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.610 
combustion which is not really
impressive<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.090> running<00:00:39.390> on

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
impressive because it's running on

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:58.120 
impressive because it's running on
naphtha<00:00:40.620> fumes<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.090> go

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.910 

so<00:00:59.130> paper<00:00:59.490> tunnel<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.060> naphtha<00:01:00.620> no<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.860> I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so paper tunnel of naphtha no way I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.370 
so paper tunnel of naphtha no way I
could<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.400> engine<00:01:02.670> run<00:01:02.700> right<00:01:03.150> now

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
could make the engine run right now

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.660 
could make the engine run right now
because<00:01:04.380> the<00:01:04.590> fuelling<00:01:04.980> is<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.280> working

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because the fuelling is not working

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.470 
because the fuelling is not working
correctly

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
correctly

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.410 
correctly
it<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.440> run<00:01:07.680> exploit<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.420> impression

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it will run exploit that impression

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.680 
it will run exploit that impression
ignite<00:01:09.720> naphtha<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.300> crank<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
ignite naphtha so I'm going to crank it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.840 
ignite naphtha so I'm going to crank it
up<00:01:12.810> I've<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> DC<00:01:13.650> motor<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.190> drive<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
up I've got a DC motor to drive it with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
up I've got a DC motor to drive it with
to<00:01:15.780> spin<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.440> over<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.920> has<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.370> spin<00:01:17.610> fairly

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
to spin it over it has to spin fairly

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.850 
to spin it over it has to spin fairly
fast

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.010 

some<00:01:28.280> little<00:01:28.790> short<00:01:29.120> sorry<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:29.690> pretty

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
some little short sorry it's pretty

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:42.480 
some little short sorry it's pretty
noisy<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.820> question<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.300> like<00:01:32.480> sensation

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:02:01.800 

60<00:01:43.390> times<00:01:43.830> quite<00:01:44.830> ready<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.190> anything

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.100 

hopefully<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.670> RAGBRAI<00:02:04.270> neck<00:02:04.780> for<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
hopefully that the RAGBRAI neck for the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.290 
hopefully that the RAGBRAI neck for the
intake<00:02:05.500> valve<00:02:08.460> thinking<00:02:09.460> like<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.759> won't<00:02:09.970> do

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
intake valve thinking like it won't do

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:21.050 
intake valve thinking like it won't do
things

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.380 

do<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:21.959> moving

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
do they get moving

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
do they get moving
No
