gonna be great for guys that have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
gonna be great for guys that have
packaging<00:01:38.369> issues<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
packaging issues really that's kind of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
packaging issues really that's kind of
the<00:01:39.900> atmosphere<00:01:40.470> behind<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.159> technologies

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the atmosphere behind that technologies

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
the atmosphere behind that technologies
to<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.450> guys<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.079> smaller

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to make it so guys can get into smaller

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
to make it so guys can get into smaller
space<00:01:43.770> exactly<00:01:44.579> smaller<00:01:44.850> space<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.659> also

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
space exactly smaller space but also

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.539 
space exactly smaller space but also
it'll<00:01:46.110> cost<00:01:46.320> less<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.490> have

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it'll cost less because you don't have

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
it'll cost less because you don't have
