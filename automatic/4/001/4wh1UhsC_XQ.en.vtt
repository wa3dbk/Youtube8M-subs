00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.040
 hello to you all, the channel of millions 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:24.509
 things today I'll show you the legs will do 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:28.989
 the review was such a movie cacodyl tandi 21 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.660
 bandits approached by experience let's money this 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.969
 Is it but that's new and pulled such 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.730
 I have a huge knife now not now 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.239
 I bought this knife in the dashing 90s it was not 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.059
 that year 92 93 then it was rampant 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.160
 banditry here in Russia 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.499
 say actually everything was more 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.429
 less calm of course there were 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:56.890
 some individual items here and there was 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.870
 still movie rambo first second third 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.699
 part he had a huge such knife to me 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.460
 so wanted this leg what i have 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.780
 It was right I dreamed about him and here is one 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.299
 one of the beautiful days came to me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.640
 familiar and offered three knives in them was 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.649
 here this one there they are quite long and 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 some other 3 do not remember here since I 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.820
 liked something he looks like our rambo 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 remotely of course there is such a pilch who 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.860
 Of course a huge pens lead steel comrade 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.180
 riveted and done all that is 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.729
 bearing unearthed a large bearing 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.409
 made him such a knife maybe this 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.909
 and not quite so maybe there will not count 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.310
 I don't know, I don't understand this 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:44.399
 old but in fact this seems to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.140
 serious so courageous look 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.399
 such a knife collector of course such 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.799
 knives like that homemade it 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.409
 rare knife now they don't 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.590
 and but maybe something remotely similar 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.590
 Of course the legs obviously even did business under 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.179
 they were not impressed with the rambo movies 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.090
 copy 11 did something rambo 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.379
 like that really when you take it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.819
 cool because i'm such 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.209
 colossal bear sizes can 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.620
 feel free to borrow and I'm joking of course 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.140
 dipper bear go it all up 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.209
 madness not to be able to behold the knife in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.569
 I'm just in the collection I did not take him with me 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.760
 board his account dwelling it just now 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.980
 weighed a mass of 420 grams for throwing this 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.140
 also these teeth are not adapted here 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.349
 do not allow with blades as it should 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.130
 they are very sharp shirts dwell of course 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.370
 but such a mass is 420 grams and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.900
 enough here is the tip thin 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.519
 definitely it will break most likely 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.160
 so for throwing he is definitely not 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.849
 intended for water, too, almost half a kilo 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.620
 carry with you still in the case cover the floor 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.140
 a kilo just isn't that hard better than that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.870
 thin 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.540
 Of course, most likely just like 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.560
 souvenir knife for beauty that bought 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.989
 Own such optical gloves called 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.590
 next to them is the same saiga carbine 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.060
 take and I have a familiar river knives 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.459
 who also love to carry gloves 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.120
 handle the knives he's so 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.310
 gloves for an hour at the cinema there for me 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.380
 to shoot some 2 robbers hero 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.329
 so negative with such knives 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.709
 only negative characters but in 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.560
 American films this will already be 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.120
 positive because such a knife 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.139
 can only be a positive character 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.270
 and for some reason Russians have big knives 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:59.060
 gangsters 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.060
 good for some reason such knives and ready 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.890
 I want to add such a thing here such 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.860
 Pros Rezero van channel just his people 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:16.290
 call the bloodstream actually this 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.930
 constructive reinforcement ie 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.320
 pumped over here these furrows for 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:28.710
 to make the blade more durable but 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:32.070
 evil this is the configuration of such a recess of 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.330
 they give greater strength not to get around 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.530
 nekra east so you know yourself were 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.520

 dark places grapher this 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.060
 Christmas tree-stick what a garbage
