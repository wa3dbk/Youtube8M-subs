face side to all the boards I'm using

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
face side to all the boards I'm using
the<00:01:09.600> number<00:01:09.720> 8<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.320> makes<00:01:10.590> short<00:01:10.890> work<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the number 8 which makes short work of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
the number 8 which makes short work of
that<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.080> I've<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.380> bow<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that and then I've got a bow in the

that and then I've got a bow in the
board<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.460> supporting<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> bow<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
board I'm supporting the bow so that I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
board I'm supporting the bow so that I
can<00:01:16.470> flatten<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:17.490> without<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> plane

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
can flatten it off without the plane

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
can flatten it off without the plane
just<00:01:18.299> pressing<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> board<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.470> flat<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
just pressing the board down flat on the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.320 
just pressing the board down flat on the
bed<00:01:24.680> 15<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> good<00:01:25.950> face<00:01:26.189> I'd<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> boards<00:01:27.180> i

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
bed 15 a good face I'd all the boards i

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
bed 15 a good face I'd all the boards i
dint<00:01:27.869> thickness<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> maximum

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
dint thickness them to the maximum

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:41.120 
dint thickness them to the maximum
dimension<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.240> manage<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> continued

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
dimension I can manage then I continued

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.389 
dimension I can manage then I continued
with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> number<00:01:41.670> 8<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.689> prepare<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.380> face<00:01:44.130> age

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
with the number 8 to prepare a face age

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.770 
with the number 8 to prepare a face age
and<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.950> I'll<00:01:47.310> prepare<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> edge<00:01:48.119> opposite

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and then I'll prepare the edge opposite

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.940 
and then I'll prepare the edge opposite
the<00:01:48.869> face<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> consistent<00:01:51.119> width<00:01:54.710> once<00:01:55.710> all

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the face to a consistent width once all

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
the face to a consistent width once all
the<00:01:56.070> boards<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.430> prepared<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.090> could<00:01:57.689> then

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the boards are prepared I could then

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
the boards are prepared I could then
glue<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> clamp<00:01:59.430> making<00:01:59.880> sure<00:02:00.060> one

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
glue up and clamp making sure one

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.969 
glue up and clamp making sure one
surface<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.960> least<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.439> totally<00:02:01.890> flat<00:02:03.979> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
surface at least is totally flat and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.910 
surface at least is totally flat and
when<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> glue<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.520> cured<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.320> straight

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
when the glue is cured and then straight

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.490 
when the glue is cured and then straight
off<00:02:08.099> any<00:02:08.310> excess<00:02:08.700> lives

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
off any excess lives

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.760 
off any excess lives
so<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.160> flat<00:02:10.399> side<00:02:10.640> down<00:02:10.700> on<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> bench<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
so the flat side down on the bench and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.920 
so the flat side down on the bench and
flatten<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> other<00:02:13.010> side<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.460> necessary<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
flatten the other side if necessary is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.710 
flatten the other side if necessary is
the<00:02:15.080> number<00:02:15.380> eight<00:02:15.530> again<00:02:18.520> now<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.550> turn<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.690> my

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
the number eight again now I turn to my

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.400 
the number eight again now I turn to my
excluder<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> scraper<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.810> produce<00:02:23.990> a

excluder and a scraper to produce a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.810 
excluder and a scraper to produce a
lovely<00:02:25.070> finish<00:02:25.280> on<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.940> shelves<00:02:30.820> defects

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
lovely finish on the shelves defects

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.960 
lovely finish on the shelves defects
like<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.870> nail<00:02:33.140> holes<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.860> clean<00:02:34.730> up<00:02:34.850> around

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
like the nail holes I clean up around

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.570 
like the nail holes I clean up around
the<00:02:35.150> edges<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> gouge<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.620> then<00:02:37.220> fill

super glue and once that's cured I

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.560 
super glue and once that's cured I
compare<00:02:50.000> away<00:02:50.270> most<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> excess<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.220> then

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
compare away most of the excess and then

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.290 
compare away most of the excess and then
prepare<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.720> nice<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.590> flat<00:02:55.370> squeeze<00:02:56.270> a
