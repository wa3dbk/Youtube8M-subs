00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
definitely be one of the experience of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.149 
definitely be one of the experience of
doing<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:08.020> creates<00:01:09.020> sort<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.409> opens<00:01:10.040> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
doing this and creates sort of opens the

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.399 
doing this and creates sort of opens the
door<00:01:10.370> cracked<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.240> door<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:13.360> possible

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
door cracked the door to possible

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.450

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.610 
different view of how to live in the
world<00:01:22.630> really<00:01:23.630> that's<00:01:23.990> not<00:01:24.110> anything<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.530> do

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620

with anything I like this painting and
close<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.210> gate<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.960> little<00:01:27.380> bit<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:27.770> I

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
close the gate is a little bit because I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.710 
close the gate is a little bit because I
was<00:01:28.250> terrified

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
was terrified

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.750 
was terrified

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
doing this whole thing yeah but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.550 
doing this whole thing yeah but
terrified<00:01:38.760> of<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.360> process<00:01:39.870> and<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
terrified of the process and the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.140 
terrified of the process and the
consequences<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.840> fearlessness<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
consequences and fearlessness about you

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.270 
consequences and fearlessness about you
because<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.300> looks<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.260> daunting<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.100> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
because it looks pretty daunting and we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.250 
because it looks pretty daunting and we
headed<00:01:47.700> across<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.420> water<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.930> over<00:01:49.200> this

have<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.150> not<00:01:57.360> quickly<00:01:58.080> how<00:01:58.380> many<00:01:58.560> they

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
have this is not quickly how many they

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
have this is not quickly how many they

this<00:02:49.209> visual<00:02:49.570> jamming<00:02:50.050> thing<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.350> thought<00:02:50.530> from

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800

this<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.700> good<00:02:51.850> i<00:02:51.970> think<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.300> we<00:02:52.450> should<00:02:52.600> take

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
this is good i think that we should take

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.150 
this is good i think that we should take
a<00:02:52.810> step<00:02:53.140> further<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.470> that's<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.920> say<00:02:54.130> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
a step further and that's what I say to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.320 
a step further and that's what I say to
this<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.760> want<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.120> do<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.370> without<00:03:00.459> music<00:03:01.000> which

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
there should be a ground at most but but

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.690 
there should be a ground at most but but
also<00:04:13.310> for<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.850> from<00:04:14.380> my<00:04:15.549> inspiration<00:04:16.549> would
