it back to me and when she brings it
back<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.880> me<00:00:18.560> I've<00:00:19.560> got<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> couple<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.189> seconds

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
back to me I've got a couple of seconds

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
back to me I've got a couple of seconds
if<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> adjust<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> piece<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.699> see

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
if I want to to adjust the piece to see

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630 
if I want to to adjust the piece to see
if<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.090> high<00:00:24.680> it's<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.340> high

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
if it's high it's a little bit high

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.599 
if it's high it's a little bit high
right<00:00:26.880> there<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:28.920> pretty<00:00:29.189> even

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
right there and now it looks pretty even

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.479 
right there and now it looks pretty even
and<00:00:29.789> you'll<00:00:30.660> notice<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.320> we've<00:00:32.279> already

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and you'll notice that we've already

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
and you'll notice that we've already
shaped<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> bottom<00:00:33.840> half<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> silver

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
shaped the bottom half of the silver

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.900 
shaped the bottom half of the silver
actually<00:00:34.890> we've<00:00:35.010> shaped<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> bottom<00:00:35.760> three

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually we've shaped the bottom three

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
actually we've shaped the bottom three
quarters<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> cylinder<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> really

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
quarters of the cylinder so all I really

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
quarters of the cylinder so all I really
need<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.940> complete<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.390> cylinder

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
need to do to complete the cylinder

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.450 
need to do to complete the cylinder
shape<00:00:40.129> is<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.370> heat<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> top<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
shape is to heat up the top now if the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100 
shape is to heat up the top now if the
piece<00:00:44.640> wasn't<00:00:44.879> made<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> glass<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:45.989> be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
piece wasn't made of glass it would be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
piece wasn't made of glass it would be
real<00:00:46.289> easy<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.920> heat<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> top<00:00:47.460> but

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
real easy I just heat up the top but

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
real easy I just heat up the top but
since<00:00:47.879> glass<00:00:48.210> tends<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> crack<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> gets

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
since glass tends to crack if it gets

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
since glass tends to crack if it gets
too<00:00:49.559> cold<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> remember

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
too cold I'm going to have to remember

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
too cold I'm going to have to remember
to<00:00:51.149> flash<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.600> plenty<00:00:51.809> occasionally<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to flash that plenty occasionally to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
to flash that plenty occasionally to
keep<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.160> heat<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
keep some heat down there as well the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
keep some heat down there as well the
glass<00:00:54.989> gets<00:00:55.140> too<00:00:55.350> cold<00:00:55.530> little<00:00:55.829> crack<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> we

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
glass gets too cold little crack and we

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.799 
glass gets too cold little crack and we
don't<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> crack<00:00:57.030> until<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> last

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
don't want it to crack until the last

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
don't want it to crack until the last
moment<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:58.649> ready<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> remove<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
moment when we're ready to remove that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.529 
moment when we're ready to remove that
punny<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:01.440> heat<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> piece<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.300> I'm

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
punny so to heat a piece like this I'm

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
punny so to heat a piece like this I'm
going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> stay<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.339> front<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
going to stay right in the front of the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
going to stay right in the front of the
gloryhole<00:01:06.270> concentrating<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> heat<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
gloryhole concentrating the heat on the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
gloryhole concentrating the heat on the
tip<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> piece<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.790> occasionally<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> take

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
tip of the piece and occasionally I take

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.550 
tip of the piece and occasionally I take
a<00:01:10.200> flash<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.890> means<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> way<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
a flash which means go all the way in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
a flash which means go all the way in
for<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> couple<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> seconds<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.000> come

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
for a couple of seconds and then come

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
for a couple of seconds and then come
out<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.960> punny<00:01:16.229> hot<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
out you don't want that punny hot and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
out you don't want that punny hot and
moving<00:01:17.310> around<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.360> want<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
moving around but you don't want it so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
moving around but you don't want it so
cold<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> seizes<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> prone<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
cold that it seizes up and is prone to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.789 
cold that it seizes up and is prone to
cracking<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.280> stay<00:01:23.610> here

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
cracking so what I do is I stay here

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
cracking so what I do is I stay here
right<00:01:25.799> until<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> tip<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.049> piece

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
right until I see the tip of that piece

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.240 
right until I see the tip of that piece
start<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> round<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:32.240> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> become

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
start to round out and want to become

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.500 
start to round out and want to become
nice<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.270> soft<00:01:37.430> you'll<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.640> notice<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.120> as

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
nice and soft you'll also notice that as

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.490 
nice and soft you'll also notice that as
with<00:01:40.230> the<00:01:40.260> other<00:01:40.410> times<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.250> turn<00:01:42.120> as<00:01:42.360> slowly<00:01:43.170> as

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
with the other times I turn as slowly as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.640 
with the other times I turn as slowly as
i<00:01:43.650> can<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:45.450> still<00:01:45.720> fast<00:01:45.930> enough<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.380> keep<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
i can but still fast enough to keep the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.430 
i can but still fast enough to keep the
peace<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:46.950> falling<00:01:47.370> off<00:01:47.460> center<00:01:47.880> ok<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
peace from falling off center ok so the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.430 
peace from falling off center ok so the
piece<00:01:49.620> is<00:01:49.770> looking<00:01:50.300> pretty<00:01:51.300> soft<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.900> there<00:01:52.140> so

I'm going to come back to the bench and
finish<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.020> cylinder<00:01:55.440> here<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:57.650> now<00:01:58.650> when

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800

you're<00:01:58.920> working<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.400> punty<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.450> don't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you're working on the punty you don't

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.680 
you're working on the punty you don't
want<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.780> bounce<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.260> piece<00:02:02.510> don't<00:02:03.510> want<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
want to bounce the piece don't want to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.050 
want to bounce the piece don't want to
knock<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> against<00:02:04.290> anything<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:05.880> going

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
knock it against anything so I'm going

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.040 
knock it against anything so I'm going
to<00:02:06.090> start<00:02:06.210> by<00:02:06.479> lifting<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.440> jacks<00:02:07.830> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
to start by lifting it with a jacks and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
to start by lifting it with a jacks and
slowly<00:02:10.050> opening<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.820> tip<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:13.290> open<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
slowly opening the tip and I open the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.940 
slowly opening the tip and I open the
jacks<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.209> piece<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.600> opening<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.800> I'm

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
jacks as the piece is opening and I'm

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.340 
jacks as the piece is opening and I'm
almost<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.690> reheat<00:02:22.020> should<00:02:22.200> do

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
almost there one more reheat should do

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.910 
almost there one more reheat should do
it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.910 

now<00:02:27.020> when<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.110> reheat<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.470> piece<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.740> glass

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
now when you reheat a piece of glass

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.800 
now when you reheat a piece of glass
it's<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.490> punty<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.239> generally<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> good

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's on the punty it's generally a good

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.900 
it's on the punty it's generally a good
idea<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.319> flash<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.800> punny<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.640> first

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
idea to flash the punny as the first

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.940 
idea to flash the punny as the first
move<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.569> all<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.050> way<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.349> make<00:02:34.920> sure

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
move so I go all the way in make sure

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.760 
move so I go all the way in make sure
that<00:02:35.220> punny<00:02:35.489> gets<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.569> little<00:02:36.720> bit<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.989> heat<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that punny gets a little bit of heat and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.650 
that punny gets a little bit of heat and
then<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.130> back<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:39.000> concentrate<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
then I can back out and concentrate that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.080 
then I can back out and concentrate that
heat<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.349> where<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> want<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> one<00:02:42.060> of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
heat just where I want it this is one of

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.040 
heat just where I want it this is one of
the<00:02:42.270> things<00:02:42.480> that's<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:42.750> nice<00:02:42.989> about

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
the things that's really nice about

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.740 
the things that's really nice about
making<00:02:43.590> cylinders<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.910> you've<00:02:45.480> made

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
making cylinders is because you've made

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380 
making cylinders is because you've made
most<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.770> shape<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.280> blowpipe<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
most of the shape on the blowpipe you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.050 
most of the shape on the blowpipe you
can<00:02:48.569> keep<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:49.230> part<00:02:49.620> out<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.310> fire

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
can keep that back part out of the fire

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.320 
can keep that back part out of the fire
and<00:02:51.330> keep<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.310> nice<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.370> cold<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> retains

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
and keep it nice and cold so it retains

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660 
and keep it nice and cold so it retains
its<00:02:54.600> shape<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.640> here

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
its shape so what I'm going to do here

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.720 
its shape so what I'm going to do here
is<00:02:57.230> concentrate<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.380> heat<00:02:58.709> again<00:02:59.160> right<00:02:59.610> at

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
is concentrate that heat again right at

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.050 
is concentrate that heat again right at
the<00:02:59.850> tip<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:02.069> when<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> tip<00:03:02.790> start

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the tip and when I see that tip start

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.280 
the tip and when I see that tip start
moving<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.989> I'm<00:03:04.110> going<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.290> come<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.530> now

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
moving then I'm going to come out now

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
moving then I'm going to come out now
one<00:03:07.290> more<00:03:07.470> flash<00:03:07.799> here<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> tip<00:03:11.519> is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
one more flash here and I see the tip is

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.059 
one more flash here and I see the tip is
moving<00:03:12.060> nicely<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.530> I'm<00:03:13.590> going<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.799> come<00:03:13.950> out

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
moving nicely so I'm going to come out

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.009 
moving nicely so I'm going to come out
we're<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> finish<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.480> ferns
