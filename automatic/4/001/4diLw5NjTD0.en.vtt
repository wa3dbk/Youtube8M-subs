00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
figured out a good easy way to make

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
figured out a good easy way to make
screenshots<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.950> i<00:00:25.980> figured<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.490> i<00:00:26.580> did<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
screenshots so i figured if i did a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.310 
screenshots so i figured if i did a
little<00:00:27.029> walkthrough<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.869> each<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.259> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
applications that would be just as well
