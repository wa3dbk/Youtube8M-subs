made the Black &amp; Decker work mate one of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
made the Black &amp; Decker work mate one of
the<00:00:37.110> most<00:00:37.260> successful<00:00:37.519> inventions<00:00:38.519> that

the most successful inventions that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
the most successful inventions that
we've<00:00:39.059> ever<00:00:39.239> come<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.650> so<00:00:40.650> before<00:00:41.010> we

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
we've ever come up with so before we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
we've ever come up with so before we
actually<00:00:41.129> start<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:41.940> assemble<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> workmates

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
actually start to assemble the workmates

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
actually start to assemble the workmates
just<00:00:43.289> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> point<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.030> gonna

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
just want to point out what I'm gonna

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
just want to point out what I'm gonna
actually<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.140> hands<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> either<00:00:47.370> side

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actually do if my hands on either side

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
actually do if my hands on either side
of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.030> work<00:00:48.210> mate<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.170> simple

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
of the work mate this is just simple

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
of the work mate this is just simple
latch<00:00:49.859> which<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.309> need<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> pull<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
latch which I need to pull up that's a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
latch which I need to pull up that's a
locking<00:00:52.289> mechanism<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.980> releases<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
locking mechanism which releases the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
locking mechanism which releases the
frame<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> enables<00:00:55.109> me<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> actually

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
frame and enables me to actually

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
frame and enables me to actually
assemble<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.030> best<00:00:57.269> way<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> actually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
assemble this the best way of actually

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
assemble this the best way of actually
assembling<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.590> work<00:00:58.829> mate<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> lay<00:00:59.519> on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
assembling your work mate is to lay on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
assembling your work mate is to lay on
the<00:00:59.879> floor<00:01:00.179> first<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.929> then<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.679> follow

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the floor first and then actually follow

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
the floor first and then actually follow
this<00:01:02.129> mix<00:01:02.429> process<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.600> lay<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this mix process so just lay it down so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
this mix process so just lay it down so
it's<00:01:04.350> nice<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.559> flat<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.429> then<00:01:05.789> both<00:01:06.030> sides

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's nice and flat and then both sides

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.029 
it's nice and flat and then both sides
we<00:01:06.539> need<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.690> reach<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.259> grab<00:01:07.470> these<00:01:07.740> two

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
we need to reach down and grab these two

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.639 
we need to reach down and grab these two
release<00:01:08.310> latches<00:01:09.229> give<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.289> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.410> bit<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
release latches give it a little bit of

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.400 
release latches give it a little bit of
a<00:01:10.710> shake<00:01:10.970> easy<00:01:11.970> enough<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.570> put<00:01:12.929> your<00:01:13.050> foot<00:01:13.289> on

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
a shake easy enough to put your foot on

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.800 
a shake easy enough to put your foot on
the<00:01:13.560> footplate<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.340> stage<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.690> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the footplate at this stage and when you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.199 
the footplate at this stage and when you
hear<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> loud<00:01:16.890> click<00:01:17.399> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.090> it's

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:18.209 
hear that loud click you know that it's

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.320 
hear that loud click you know that it's
actually<00:01:18.360> engaged<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.319> ready<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.920> used<00:01:20.330> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
actually engaged and ready to be used so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.029 
actually engaged and ready to be used so
I'm<00:01:21.660> just<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> show<00:01:22.289> you<00:01:22.349> how<00:01:22.709> to<00:01:22.770> take

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
I'm just going to show you how to take

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.859 
I'm just going to show you how to take
it<00:01:23.069> from<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.520> position<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.209> make<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it from this position and make it a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
it from this position and make it a
little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.259> higher<00:01:25.789> again<00:01:26.789> you<00:01:26.940> don't<00:01:27.149> need

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
little bit higher again you don't need

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.150 
little bit higher again you don't need
any<00:01:27.479> tools<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.410> need<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.649> put<00:01:28.800> your<00:01:28.920> hand

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
any tools you just need to put your hand

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.660 
any tools you just need to put your hand
underneath<00:01:29.489> and<00:01:30.270> grab<00:01:30.569> one<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.959> legs<00:01:31.670> pull

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
underneath and grab one of the legs pull

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
underneath and grab one of the legs pull
it<00:01:32.819> out<00:01:32.940> so<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.209> goes<00:01:33.360> click<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.080> then<00:01:34.289> that's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it out so it goes click and then that's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.029 
it out so it goes click and then that's
straightaway<00:01:35.099> in<00:01:35.280> place<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> exactly

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
straightaway in place we do the exactly

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.710 
straightaway in place we do the exactly
the<00:01:38.130> same<00:01:38.190> process<00:01:38.910> at<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.539> work

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the same process at the back of the work

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.080 
the same process at the back of the work
mates<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:45.690> really<00:01:45.929> is<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.380> easy<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.739> that

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
mates and it really is as easy as that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.249 
mates and it really is as easy as that
now<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.300> actually<00:01:48.450> work<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.050> with<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
now when you actually work in with a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.619 
now when you actually work in with a
variety<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.800> different<00:01:50.069> tools<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:51.330> could<00:01:51.539> be

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:51.629 
variety of different tools they could be

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:54.440 
variety of different tools they could be
hand<00:01:51.959> tools<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.530> power<00:01:52.860> tools<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.209> don't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
hand tools or power tools what you don't

get a perfect result okay I'm now going

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.069 
get a perfect result okay I'm now going
to<00:02:17.700> show<00:02:17.969> you<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> work<00:02:18.689> mate<00:02:18.900> can

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
to show you how the work mate can

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.869 
to show you how the work mate can
actually<00:02:19.319> be<00:02:19.469> used<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.890> its<00:02:20.069> lowest<00:02:20.579> height

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
actually be used in its lowest height

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.790 
actually be used in its lowest height
setting<00:02:21.450> there's<00:02:22.109> two<00:02:22.409> Reed

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
setting there's two Reed

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.940 
setting there's two Reed
why<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> might<00:02:23.550> want<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.880> use<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.360> setting

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
why you might want to use this setting

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.680 
why you might want to use this setting
firstly<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.460> may<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.670> very<00:02:27.090> very<00:02:27.180> tight<00:02:27.660> on

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
firstly you may be very very tight on

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
firstly you may be very very tight on
space<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.680> actually<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.580> put<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
space and actually have to put the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.540 
space and actually have to put the
workmate<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.540> another<00:02:30.840> table<00:02:31.380> surface<00:02:31.650> or

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
workmate on another table surface or

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
workmate on another table surface or
secondly<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.810> might<00:02:34.050> be<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.350> you're<00:02:34.470> working

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
secondly it might be that you're working

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
secondly it might be that you're working
on<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> side<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.670> door<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.780> need<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
on the side of a door and you need to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.900 
on the side of a door and you need to
actually<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> material<00:02:38.220> from<00:02:38.730> this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
actually have the material from this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.330 
actually have the material from this
position<00:02:39.150> down<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.320> much<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.830> comfortable

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
position down to a much more comfortable

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.970 
position down to a much more comfortable
working<00:02:41.610> position<00:02:42.000> low<00:02:42.540> down<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.590> let's<00:02:43.770> just

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
working position low down so let's just

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.890 
working position low down so let's just
see<00:02:44.100> how<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.490> done<00:02:44.700> again<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.570> first

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
see how that's done again the first

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840 
see how that's done again the first
thing<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.130> actually<00:02:47.430> lower

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
thing I'm going to do is actually lower

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.420 
thing I'm going to do is actually lower
the<00:02:48.060> legs<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.930> collapse<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.590> legs<00:02:49.800> it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the legs so to collapse the legs it's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.000 
the legs so to collapse the legs it's
ever<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.880> easy<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:52.230> lift<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.710> front<00:02:52.890> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
ever so easy I just lift up the front of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.400 
ever so easy I just lift up the front of
the<00:02:53.070> workmate<00:02:53.720> again<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> don't<00:02:55.080> need<00:02:55.200> any

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the workmate again I don't need any

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.730 
the workmate again I don't need any
special<00:02:55.860> tools<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.430> push<00:02:56.790> these<00:02:57.060> legs<00:02:57.330> in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
special tools I just push these legs in

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.470 
special tools I just push these legs in
I'm<00:02:58.740> listening<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> click<00:02:59.820> noise<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I'm listening for that click noise to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960 
I'm listening for that click noise to
make<00:03:00.660> sure<00:03:00.840> they're<00:03:01.020> fully<00:03:01.260> engaged<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.790> do

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
make sure they're fully engaged we do

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.730 
make sure they're fully engaged we do
exactly<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.540> same<00:03:03.570> at<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.960> reverse<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
exactly the same at the reverse of the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.900 
exactly the same at the reverse of the
unit<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:06.090> both<00:03:06.450> sides<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.430> then<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.730> need

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
unit on both sides and then what we need

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
unit on both sides and then what we need
to<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.540> actually<00:03:09.660> drop<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.560> height<00:03:10.770> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to do now is actually drop the height of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.680 
to do now is actually drop the height of
the<00:03:11.040> work<00:03:11.220> mates<00:03:11.700> completely<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.660> back

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the work mates completely so we go back

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.590 
the work mates completely so we go back
to<00:03:12.960> those<00:03:13.230> latches<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.980> side<00:03:17.480> bring<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
to those latches at the side bring the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.450 
to those latches at the side bring the
work<00:03:18.750> make<00:03:19.050> right<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.860> way<00:03:19.950> down<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
work make right the way down to the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.340 
work make right the way down to the
floor<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.910> again<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.720> make<00:03:21.960> sure<00:03:21.990> it's

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
floor and again just make sure it's

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.520 
floor and again just make sure it's
locked<00:03:22.680> into<00:03:22.890> place<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.750> enables<00:03:25.200> me<00:03:25.260> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
locked into place now this enables me to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
locked into place now this enables me to
still<00:03:25.830> use<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.250> clamp<00:03:26.490> iam<00:03:26.670> facility<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.780> in

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
still use the clamp iam facility but in

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.350 
still use the clamp iam facility but in
its<00:03:28.080> lowest<00:03:28.440> height<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.550> height<00:03:29.850> one

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
its lowest height so this is height one

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.420 
its lowest height so this is height one
but<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.590> actually<00:03:31.770> want<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.100> put<00:03:32.340> this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
but then if I actually want to put this

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.840 
but then if I actually want to put this
onto<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.790> tabletop<00:03:33.360> or<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.220> laminated<00:03:35.220> floor<00:03:35.580> I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
onto a tabletop or a laminated floor I

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.479 
onto a tabletop or a laminated floor I
definitely<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.720> want<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.080> scratch<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.800> so

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
definitely don't want to scratch it so

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.830 
definitely don't want to scratch it so
what<00:03:38.700> Black<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.180> Decker<00:03:39.209> actually

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
what Black and Decker actually

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.990 
what Black and Decker actually
incorporated<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.739> design<00:03:40.890> are<00:03:41.580> these

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
incorporated in the design are these

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.930 
incorporated in the design are these
rubber<00:03:42.450> feet<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:43.200> each<00:03:43.560> corner<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.310> that's

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
rubber feet on each corner and that's

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.699 
rubber feet on each corner and that's
done<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:45.750> won't<00:03:45.930> actually<00:03:46.200> scratch

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
done so that we won't actually scratch

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.750 
done so that we won't actually scratch
or<00:03:46.890> mark<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.370> surface<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.370> lift<00:03:50.610> this

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
or mark a surface so we just lift this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.210 
or mark a surface so we just lift this
up<00:03:50.910> onto<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.239> table<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:51.900> easy<00:03:52.230> work

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
up onto a table it's very easy work

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.650 
up onto a table it's very easy work
mates<00:03:53.459> aren't<00:03:53.760> particularly<00:03:54.060> heavy<00:03:54.390> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
mates aren't particularly heavy so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.690 
mates aren't particularly heavy so
they're<00:03:54.810> very<00:03:54.840> very<00:03:55.080> maneuverable<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.100> you

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
they're very very maneuverable and you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.210 
they're very very maneuverable and you
can<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:57.350> even<00:03:58.350> if<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.530> was<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.860> small

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
can see now even if I was in a small

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.220 
can see now even if I was in a small
room<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.850> could<00:04:00.180> still<00:04:00.420> actually<00:04:00.750> work<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
room I could still actually work and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.370 
room I could still actually work and
clamp<00:04:01.530> my<00:04:01.680> material<00:04:02.220> easily<00:04:03.230> there's<00:04:04.230> some

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
clamp my material easily there's some

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.630 
clamp my material easily there's some
genius<00:04:04.890> things<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.340> we've<00:04:05.459> actually

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
genius things that we've actually

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.490 
genius things that we've actually
developed<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.690> design<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.200> work<00:04:07.350> mate

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
developed in the design of the work mate

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.800 
developed in the design of the work mate
over<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> years<00:04:08.010> one<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:08.850> them<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.270> single

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
over the years one of them is a single

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.220 
over the years one of them is a single
handle<00:04:10.500> clamping<00:04:11.220> operation<00:04:12.230> conventionally

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
handle clamping operation conventionally

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.199 
handle clamping operation conventionally
you'd<00:04:13.380> actually<00:04:13.650> wind<00:04:13.890> both<00:04:14.160> handles<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.910> open

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
you'd actually wind both handles to open

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.150 
you'd actually wind both handles to open
and<00:04:15.330> close<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.720> jaws<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.590> now<00:04:16.830> we've

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and close the jaws but now we've

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.490 
and close the jaws but now we've
actually<00:04:17.310> improved<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.000> design<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.290> we

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
actually improved this design so that we

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.409 
actually improved this design so that we
can<00:04:19.650> actually<00:04:19.769> take<00:04:20.040> large<00:04:20.370> items<00:04:20.880> such<00:04:21.150> this

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
can actually take large items such this

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.909 
can actually take large items such this
door<00:04:21.980> we<00:04:22.980> can<00:04:23.190> now<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.630> single-handedly

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
door we can now just single-handedly

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.100 
door we can now just single-handedly
tighten<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.820> cross<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.270> door<00:04:27.480> and

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
tighten up on the cross the door and

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.080 
tighten up on the cross the door and
that's<00:04:28.200> actually<00:04:28.620> ready<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.040> work<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.520> okay

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
that's actually ready to work on okay

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.400 
that's actually ready to work on okay
just<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.450> show<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:31.110> we<00:04:31.229> are<00:04:31.260> really

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
just to show you that we are really

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.920 
just to show you that we are really
trying<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.100> make<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.370> best<00:04:32.640> even<00:04:33.419> better

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
trying to make the best even better

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.230 
trying to make the best even better
we've<00:04:34.500> actually<00:04:34.710> got<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.070> brand<00:04:35.580> new<00:04:35.729> thing

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
we've actually got a brand new thing

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.659 
we've actually got a brand new thing
on<00:04:36.419> this<00:04:36.569> web<00:04:36.840> mate<00:04:37.110> let's<00:04:37.979> just<00:04:38.190> take<00:04:38.430> these

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
on this web mate let's just take these

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.670 
on this web mate let's just take these
material<00:04:39.539> clamps<00:04:39.900> out<00:04:40.050> first

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
material clamps out first

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.760 
material clamps out first
these<00:04:40.860> orange<00:04:41.160> pegs<00:04:41.460> very<00:04:42.270> easy<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.630> remove

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.309 

and<00:04:47.000> I'd<00:04:48.000> like<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.449> bring<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.199> your<00:04:49.259> attention

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
and I'd like to bring to your attention

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.640 
and I'd like to bring to your attention
this<00:04:49.949> front<00:04:50.400> bar<00:04:50.789> here<00:04:51.300> when<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.229> pull<00:04:52.470> this

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
this front bar here when I pull this

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.589 
this front bar here when I pull this
front<00:04:52.919> bar<00:04:53.190> something<00:04:53.669> special<00:04:54.150> happens<00:04:54.479> to

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
front bar something special happens to

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.129 
front bar something special happens to
the<00:04:54.690> workmate<00:04:58.819> we<00:04:59.819> now<00:05:00.120> are<00:05:00.330> able<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.870> actually

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
the workmate we now are able to actually

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.730 
the workmate we now are able to actually
clamp<00:05:01.470> things<00:05:01.770> down<00:05:02.150> vertically<00:05:03.680> okay<00:05:04.680> so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
clamp things down vertically okay so

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.279 
clamp things down vertically okay so
this<00:05:04.949> feature<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.580> particularly<00:05:06.060> useful<00:05:06.389> when

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
this feature is particularly useful when

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.499 
this feature is particularly useful when
I<00:05:07.349> actually<00:05:07.590> want<00:05:07.949> to<00:05:08.039> clamp<00:05:08.819> a<00:05:09.030> piece<00:05:09.330> of

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
I actually want to clamp a piece of

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.040 
I actually want to clamp a piece of
material<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.979> way

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
material this way

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.510 
material this way
now<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.380> line<00:05:13.560> up<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:13.889> awkward<00:05:14.310> shape

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
now you just line up this awkward shape

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.730 
now you just line up this awkward shape
into<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:14.970> workmate<00:05:15.449> and<00:05:15.720> all<00:05:16.199> we<00:05:16.319> need<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.590> do

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
into the workmate and all we need to do

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.480 
into the workmate and all we need to do
again<00:05:17.069> is<00:05:17.099> this<00:05:17.310> one<00:05:17.520> hand<00:05:17.880> we<00:05:18.240> tighten<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.780> up

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
again is this one hand we tighten it up

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.860 
again is this one hand we tighten it up
and<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:20.639> is<00:05:20.759> quite<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:20.970> large<00:05:21.180> object<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.750> in

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
and this is quite a large object so in

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.570 
and this is quite a large object so in
this<00:05:21.990> case<00:05:22.319> what<00:05:22.590> I'd<00:05:22.680> actually<00:05:22.830> be<00:05:23.190> tempted

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
this case what I'd actually be tempted

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.279 
this case what I'd actually be tempted
is<00:05:23.639> once<00:05:23.849> eventually<00:05:24.180> got<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.360> tight<00:05:24.599> enough<00:05:24.960> I

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
is once eventually got it tight enough I

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.800 
is once eventually got it tight enough I
just<00:05:25.650> give<00:05:26.159> it<00:05:26.280> an<00:05:26.460> extra<00:05:26.970> tweak<00:05:27.300> with<00:05:27.569> both

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
just give it an extra tweak with both

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.719 
just give it an extra tweak with both
handles<00:05:28.380> that's<00:05:28.590> really<00:05:28.979> gonna<00:05:29.130> hold<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:29.580> into

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
handles that's really gonna hold it into

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.540 
handles that's really gonna hold it into
place<00:05:30.060> firmly<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.900> now<00:05:31.710> I<00:05:32.039> could<00:05:32.400> actually

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
place firmly and now I could actually

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.760 
place firmly and now I could actually
use<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.389> actually<00:05:33.539> cut<00:05:33.900> sheet<00:05:34.199> material

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
use this to actually cut sheet material

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.820 
use this to actually cut sheet material
down<00:05:35.009> or<00:05:35.310> doors<00:05:36.060> down<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.539> size<00:05:36.780> perhaps<00:05:37.590> using

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
down or doors down to size perhaps using

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.100 
down or doors down to size perhaps using
the<00:05:38.009> circular<00:05:38.250> saw<00:05:38.699> makes<00:05:39.479> it<00:05:39.630> much<00:05:39.840> much

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
the circular saw makes it much much

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.670 
the circular saw makes it much much
easier<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.650> actually<00:05:40.800> manage<00:05:41.370> your<00:05:41.550> material

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
easier to actually manage your material

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.230 
easier to actually manage your material
traditionally<00:05:43.680> would<00:05:44.039> a<00:05:44.070> metal<00:05:44.460> hard<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.880> grip

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
traditionally would a metal hard to grip

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.450 
traditionally would a metal hard to grip
but<00:05:45.750> because<00:05:46.080> we've<00:05:46.229> got<00:05:46.349> this<00:05:46.440> bamboo<00:05:47.099> table

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
but because we've got this bamboo table

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.550 
but because we've got this bamboo table
surface<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.780> way<00:05:48.900> we've<00:05:49.380> actually

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
surface and the way we've actually

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.310 
surface and the way we've actually
worked<00:05:49.889> out<00:05:50.219> some<00:05:50.520> V<00:05:51.150> notches<00:05:51.509> and<00:05:52.020> grooves

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
worked out some V notches and grooves

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.950 
worked out some V notches and grooves
actually<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.889> table<00:05:53.370> door<00:05:53.639> faces<00:05:54.210> we<00:05:54.780> can

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
actually in the table door faces we can

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:03.170 
actually in the table door faces we can
actually<00:05:55.110> grip<00:05:55.530> metal<00:05:55.949> no<00:05:56.130> problem<00:06:01.909> as<00:06:02.909> easy

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
actually grip metal no problem as easy

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.559 
actually grip metal no problem as easy
as<00:06:03.360> that<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:03.780> ready<00:06:04.139> to<00:06:04.229> cut<00:06:05.240> okay<00:06:06.240> just<00:06:06.449> want

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
as that and ready to cut okay just want

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.330 
as that and ready to cut okay just want
to<00:06:06.630> have<00:06:06.719> a<00:06:06.750> look<00:06:06.870> at<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.110> various<00:06:08.039> different

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
to have a look at the various different

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.680 
to have a look at the various different
capacities<00:06:08.909> you<00:06:08.940> could<00:06:09.240> have<00:06:09.419> some<00:06:09.599> or

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
capacities you could have some or

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.839 
capacities you could have some or
workmate<00:06:10.080> let's<00:06:10.650> just<00:06:10.830> open<00:06:11.130> up<00:06:11.219> the<00:06:11.370> jaws<00:06:11.580> now

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
workmate let's just open up the jaws now

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.140 
workmate let's just open up the jaws now
so<00:06:12.060> we<00:06:12.150> see<00:06:12.300> how<00:06:12.360> wide<00:06:12.599> they<00:06:12.810> go<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:15.000> thing

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
so we see how wide they go the thing

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.209 
so we see how wide they go the thing
about<00:06:15.210> DIY<00:06:15.659> is<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.169> never<00:06:16.319> really<00:06:16.469> know<00:06:16.919> what

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
about DIY is you never really know what

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.950 
about DIY is you never really know what
thickness<00:06:17.550> material<00:06:18.150> are<00:06:18.210> gonna<00:06:18.330> be<00:06:18.539> working

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
thickness material are gonna be working

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.320 
thickness material are gonna be working
on<00:06:19.050> next<00:06:19.289> so<00:06:19.919> this<00:06:20.039> is<00:06:20.159> quite<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.400> narrow<00:06:20.729> area

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
on next so this is quite a narrow area

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.180 
on next so this is quite a narrow area
but<00:06:21.840> we<00:06:21.960> have<00:06:22.139> actually<00:06:22.289> got<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> facility<00:06:23.159> to

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
but we have actually got a facility to

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.029 
but we have actually got a facility to
actually<00:06:23.460> make<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.120> even<00:06:24.509> wider<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:25.740> whole

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
actually make it even wider this whole

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.800 
actually make it even wider this whole
rear<00:06:26.340> jaw<00:06:26.639> section<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.270> work<00:06:27.419> mate<00:06:27.659> has

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
rear jaw section on the work mate has

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.870 
rear jaw section on the work mate has
been<00:06:28.020> designed<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:29.130> it<00:06:29.190> can<00:06:29.340> actually<00:06:29.490> be

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
been designed so it can actually be

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.570 
been designed so it can actually be
taken<00:06:30.150> off<00:06:30.479> unclipped<00:06:31.409> and<00:06:32.039> if<00:06:32.159> we<00:06:32.280> just<00:06:32.310> ever

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
taken off unclipped and if we just ever

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.059 
taken off unclipped and if we just ever
look<00:06:32.880> at<00:06:33.060> these<00:06:33.270> holes<00:06:33.750> and<00:06:34.080> slots<00:06:34.380> here<00:06:34.919> it

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
look at these holes and slots here it

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.390 
look at these holes and slots here it
enables<00:06:35.940> us<00:06:36.000> to<00:06:36.180> go<00:06:36.360> back<00:06:36.659> to<00:06:37.530> more<00:06:37.770> stages

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
enables us to go back to more stages

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.760 
enables us to go back to more stages
this<00:06:39.000> is<00:06:39.210> stage<00:06:39.449> 2<00:06:40.819> stage<00:06:41.819> 3<00:06:42.440> giving<00:06:43.440> us<00:06:43.560> a

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
this is stage 2 stage 3 giving us a

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.850 
this is stage 2 stage 3 giving us a
widest<00:06:44.370> table<00:06:44.909> width<00:06:45.180> if<00:06:45.750> you<00:06:46.289> still<00:06:46.560> can't

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
widest table width if you still can't

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.500 
widest table width if you still can't
get<00:06:46.979> the<00:06:47.099> object<00:06:47.520> that<00:06:47.580> you<00:06:47.699> want<00:06:47.880> to<00:06:48.000> clamp<00:06:48.300> in

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
get the object that you want to clamp in

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.530 
get the object that you want to clamp in
this<00:06:48.630> area<00:06:49.020> here

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
this area here

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.879 
this area here
what<00:06:51.540> you<00:06:51.660> can<00:06:51.840> actually<00:06:51.990> look<00:06:52.290> at<00:06:52.470> doing<00:06:52.770> is

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
what you can actually look at doing is

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.950 
what you can actually look at doing is
using<00:06:53.340> these<00:06:53.520> various<00:06:54.360> different<00:06:54.540> holes

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
using these various different holes

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.900 
using these various different holes
which<00:06:55.350> have<00:06:55.380> actually<00:06:55.620> been<00:06:55.830> put<00:06:56.340> all<00:06:56.850> over

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
which have actually been put all over

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.420 
which have actually been put all over
the<00:06:57.360> table<00:06:57.780> area<00:06:58.020> which<00:06:58.889> enables<00:06:59.340> you<00:06:59.400> to

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
the table area which enables you to

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.659 
the table area which enables you to
increase<00:07:00.120> further<00:07:00.539> the<00:07:01.500> range<00:07:01.800> of<00:07:02.190> widths

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
increase further the range of widths

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.820 
increase further the range of widths
that<00:07:02.729> you<00:07:02.940> can<00:07:03.090> actually<00:07:03.419> clamp<00:07:03.720> up<00:07:03.960> let's

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
that you can actually clamp up let's

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.560 
that you can actually clamp up let's
face<00:07:05.070> it<00:07:05.100> DIY<00:07:05.699> doesn't<00:07:06.120> have<00:07:06.300> to<00:07:06.419> be<00:07:06.539> a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
face it DIY doesn't have to be a

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.540 
face it DIY doesn't have to be a
disaster<00:07:07.259> if<00:07:07.440> you<00:07:07.889> want<00:07:08.070> to<00:07:08.160> actually<00:07:08.400> reduce

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
disaster if you want to actually reduce

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.550 
disaster if you want to actually reduce
how<00:07:08.970> many<00:07:09.180> arguments<00:07:09.539> you<00:07:09.780> have<00:07:09.810> about<00:07:10.289> who's

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
how many arguments you have about who's

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.320 
how many arguments you have about who's
gonna<00:07:10.740> hold<00:07:11.039> what<00:07:11.400> and<00:07:11.610> can<00:07:11.820> you<00:07:11.940> keep<00:07:12.090> this

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
gonna hold what and can you keep this

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.570 
gonna hold what and can you keep this
still<00:07:12.600> for<00:07:12.900> me<00:07:13.050> just<00:07:13.800> remember<00:07:14.190> this

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580
