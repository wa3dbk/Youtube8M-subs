00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.180 
that the wig is four hundred dollars I
think<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.110> save<00:03:24.350> up<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.709> three

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
think that you can save up to three

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.979 
think that you can save up to three
hundred<00:03:25.310> dollars<00:03:25.489> depending<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.239> price<00:03:26.780> I

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
hundred dollars depending on the price I

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.890 
hundred dollars depending on the price I
don't<00:03:27.080> think<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> wig<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:28.090> 365<00:03:29.090> they<00:03:29.690> gonna

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
don't think if the wig is 365 they gonna

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.470 
don't think if the wig is 365 they gonna
give<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.350> three<00:03:31.340> dollars<00:03:31.790> off<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.300> pay

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
give you three dollars off if you pay

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.060 
give you three dollars off if you pay
$65<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.440> don't<00:03:33.590> think<00:03:33.709> that's<00:03:33.830> what<00:03:33.950> they're

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
$65 I don't think that's what they're

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.160 
$65 I don't think that's what they're
saying<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.400> think<00:03:34.550> they're<00:03:34.670> saying<00:03:34.820> that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
saying I think they're saying that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.570 
saying I think they're saying that
that's<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.320> far<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.830> savings<00:03:37.190> will<00:03:37.340> go

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
that's as far as the savings will go

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.150 
that's as far as the savings will go
depending<00:03:38.420> on<00:03:38.510> what<00:03:38.660> items<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.500> particularly

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
depending on what items you particularly

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.759 
depending on what items you particularly
buy<00:03:40.489> um<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.840> yeah<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.170> don't<00:03:42.290> know<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.590> wasn't

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
buy um but yeah I don't know it wasn't

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.100 
buy um but yeah I don't know it wasn't
really<00:03:43.070> specified<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.820> me<00:03:43.970> what<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.510> exactly

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
really specified to me what that exactly

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.840 
really specified to me what that exactly
meant<00:03:45.410> but<00:03:45.590> for<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:45.950> from<00:03:46.130> what<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> know<00:03:46.430> for

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
meant but for going from what I know for

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.790 
meant but for going from what I know for
themselves<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.600> general<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.230> think<00:03:48.560> that's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
themselves in general I think that's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.830 
themselves in general I think that's
what<00:03:49.070> they<00:03:49.220> mean<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.730> remember<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.360> goes<00:03:50.570> on

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
what they mean and remember this goes on

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.660 
what they mean and remember this goes on
in<00:03:50.989> January<00:03:51.620> third<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> little

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
in January third so you have a little

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.070 
in January third so you have a little
bit<00:03:52.850> after<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.209> new<00:03:53.390> year<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.720> figure<00:03:53.989> out

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
bit after the new year to figure out

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.140 
bit after the new year to figure out
exactly<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.860> want<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.310> if<00:03:55.670> any<00:03:56.000> of

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
exactly what you want and if any of

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.960 
you know what I'm trying to do a little
bit<00:04:59.600> more<00:04:59.630> than<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.530> generic<00:05:00.890> so<00:05:01.580> that's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
bit more than the generic so that's

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.060 
bit more than the generic so that's
always<00:05:02.240> an<00:05:02.510> option<00:05:02.720> yes<00:05:03.260> sometimes<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.920> does

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
always an option yes sometimes it does

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.490 
always an option yes sometimes it does
cost<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.460> little<00:05:04.490> bit<00:05:04.760> more<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.480> it's<00:05:05.630> not<00:05:05.960> like

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
cost a little bit more but it's not like

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.640 
cost a little bit more but it's not like
