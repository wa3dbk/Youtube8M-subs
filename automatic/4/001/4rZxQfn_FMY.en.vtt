00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
to scout for the maturity of your canola

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.619 
to scout for the maturity of your canola
crop<00:00:39.290> in<00:00:39.500> particular<00:00:40.239> judging<00:00:41.239> your<00:00:41.300> swath

timing<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.470> trying<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.489> make<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.670> right

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120

decision<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.690> how<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.430> swath<00:00:46.430> your<00:00:46.699> crop

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.369 
decision on how to swath your crop
properly<00:00:47.589> so<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.820> one<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.449> first<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:51.140> most

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
properly so the one of the first in most

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.200 
properly so the one of the first in most
important<00:00:51.920> points<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.399> think<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.030> need

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
important points I think that you need

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.529 
important points I think that you need
to<00:00:53.239> look<00:00:53.629> at<00:00:53.840> when<00:00:54.050> you're<00:00:54.170> trying<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.680> decide

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
to look at when you're trying to decide

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.450 
to look at when you're trying to decide
when<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.570> swath<00:00:56.929> your<00:00:57.140> canola<00:00:57.410> crop<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:58.039> to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
when to swath your canola crop is to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.130 
when to swath your canola crop is to
consider<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.039> how<00:01:01.039> even<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.179> maturity<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.809> on

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
consider the how even the maturity is on

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.169 
consider the how even the maturity is on
your<00:01:03.289> crop<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:04.039> particular<00:01:04.580> crop<00:01:04.789> actually

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
your crop this particular crop actually

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:06.999 
your crop this particular crop actually
looks<00:01:05.360> fairly<00:01:05.690> uniform<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:06.320> its<00:01:06.440> maturity<00:01:06.740> but

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
looks fairly uniform in its maturity but

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.850 
looks fairly uniform in its maturity but
if<00:01:07.399> your<00:01:07.880> plants<00:01:08.240> stand<00:01:08.479> was<00:01:08.840> non-uniform<00:01:09.649> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
if your plants stand was non-uniform to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.440 
if your plants stand was non-uniform to
begin<00:01:10.340> with<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:10.850> might<00:01:11.000> actually<00:01:11.210> have

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
begin with then you might actually have

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450 
begin with then you might actually have
a<00:01:11.600> couple<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:12.110> different<00:01:12.530> maturing<00:01:13.190> crops

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
a couple of different maturing crops

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.380 
a couple of different maturing crops
within<00:01:13.880> your<00:01:14.030> field<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:16.090> those<00:01:17.090> are<00:01:17.330> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
within your field and those are the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.779 
within your field and those are the
toughest<00:01:17.720> fields<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.440> decide<00:01:18.830> as<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.310> when

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
toughest fields to to decide as to when

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.870 
toughest fields to to decide as to when
to<00:01:19.820> swath<00:01:20.420> them<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.190> challenge<00:01:22.640> and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
to swath them and the the challenge and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.669 
to swath them and the the challenge and
maybe<00:01:23.060> even<00:01:23.209> the<00:01:23.420> art<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.929> making<00:01:24.380> that

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
maybe even the art of making that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.350 
maybe even the art of making that
decision<00:01:24.739> really<00:01:25.280> comes<00:01:25.580> down<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.819> you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
decision really comes down to you

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.639 
decision really comes down to you
deciding<00:01:26.989> which<00:01:27.770> part<00:01:28.459> of<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:28.640> crop<00:01:29.030> is

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
deciding which part of that crop is

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.969 
deciding which part of that crop is
contains<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.860> most<00:01:30.979> yield<00:01:32.259> so<00:01:33.259> what<00:01:33.709> you<00:01:33.800> want

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
contains the most yield so what you want

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.070 
contains the most yield so what you want
to<00:01:34.099> do<00:01:34.250> when<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.880> do<00:01:35.030> have<00:01:35.209> a<00:01:35.239> non-uniform

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
to do when if you do have a non-uniform

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.380 
to do when if you do have a non-uniform
crop<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.979> get<00:01:37.130> out<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.489> try<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.819> assessing

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
crop is to get out and try it assessing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.240 
crop is to get out and try it assessing
each<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.349> those<00:01:39.440> different<00:01:39.679> maturing

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
each of those different maturing

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.760 
each of those different maturing
components<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.330> crop<00:01:41.569> to<00:01:42.289> determine

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
components of that crop to determine

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.389 
components of that crop to determine
which<00:01:43.209> which<00:01:44.209> ones<00:01:44.479> are<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.110> ready<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.160> swath

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
which which ones are the ready to swath

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.690 
which which ones are the ready to swath
at<00:01:46.759> any<00:01:46.940> particular<00:01:47.300> time<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.550> this

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
at any particular time so this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.729 
at any particular time so this
particular<00:01:49.849> crop<00:01:50.360> actually<00:01:50.810> looks<00:01:51.020> quite

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:51.739 
particular crop actually looks quite

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.109 
particular crop actually looks quite
uniform<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:52.550> one's<00:01:52.759> going<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:52.970> be<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
uniform so this one's going to be a

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.650 
uniform so this one's going to be a
little<00:01:53.390> bit<00:01:53.569> easier<00:01:54.099> but<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:56.119> basics<00:01:56.479> are

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
little bit easier but the the basics are

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.510 
little bit easier but the the basics are
that<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:57.319> want<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.679> check<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:57.979> few<00:01:58.129> different

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
that you want to check a few different

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.190 
that you want to check a few different
areas<00:01:58.640> within<00:01:59.000> your<00:01:59.149> within<00:01:59.599> the<00:01:59.690> canola<00:01:59.959> crop

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
areas within your within the canola crop

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.740 
areas within your within the canola crop
to<00:02:00.379> make<00:02:00.530> sure<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.520> are<00:02:01.640> getting<00:02:01.849> a<00:02:02.030> good

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
to make sure that you are getting a good

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.350 
to make sure that you are getting a good

sample across the entire field make sure

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.749 
sample across the entire field make sure
that<00:02:05.479> you're<00:02:05.599> not<00:02:05.750> missing<00:02:05.959> any<00:02:06.399> low<00:02:07.399> spots

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
that you're not missing any low spots

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.190 
that you're not missing any low spots
high<00:02:07.970> spots<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.509> might<00:02:08.660> be<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.989> different

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
high spots that might be of different

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.350 
high spots that might be of different
maturity<00:02:09.830> try<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> select<00:02:10.700> areas<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.239> are

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
going to be representative so we're

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.110 
going to be representative so we're

how<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.790> one's<00:02:17.060> coming<00:02:17.330> along<00:02:17.599> for<00:02:17.780> maturity

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
how this one's coming along for maturity

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.240 
how this one's coming along for maturity
so<00:02:21.070> when<00:02:21.220> you're<00:02:21.340> sampling<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.330> canola<00:02:22.930> crop

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so when you're sampling a canola crop

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.650 
so when you're sampling a canola crop
best<00:02:24.250> thing<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.460> do<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.030> when<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.240> walk<00:02:25.420> in

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
best thing to do is is when you walk in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.860 
best thing to do is is when you walk in
is<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.260> grab<00:02:26.500> five<00:02:27.220> six<00:02:27.670> seven<00:02:28.240> plants<00:02:28.690> that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
is to grab five six seven plants that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.510 
is to grab five six seven plants that
you<00:02:28.990> think<00:02:29.200> are<00:02:29.290> fairly<00:02:29.530> representative<00:02:30.220> of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
you think are fairly representative of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.850 
you think are fairly representative of
that<00:02:30.550> sample<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.450> want<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.780> make<00:02:31.930> so

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
that sample that you want to make so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.250 
that sample that you want to make so
we'll<00:02:33.040> take<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> couple<00:02:33.580> right<00:02:33.850> now<00:02:37.080> ground<00:02:38.080> is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
we'll take a couple right now ground is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.970 
we'll take a couple right now ground is
a<00:02:38.290> little<00:02:38.590> hard<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.440> we've<00:02:41.590> got<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.770> few

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
a little hard here so we've got a few

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.160 
a little hard here so we've got a few
plants<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.180> time<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:43.930> are

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
plants here now the time that we are

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.870 
plants here now the time that we are
looking<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> little<00:02:45.400> bit<00:02:45.490> early<00:02:45.520> to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
looking at this is a little bit early to

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.060 
looking at this is a little bit early to
be<00:02:45.910> making<00:02:46.030> any<00:02:46.480> swathing<00:02:47.020> decisions<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.709> if

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
be making any swathing decisions but if

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.000 
be making any swathing decisions but if
you<00:02:48.459> do<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:50.320> get<00:02:50.440> out<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.709> do<00:02:50.830> some

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
you do want to to get out and do some

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.350 
you do want to to get out and do some
scouting<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.640> essentially<00:02:52.060> what<00:02:52.180> you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
scouting this is essentially what you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.690 
scouting this is essentially what you
want<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.100> take<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.400> canola

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
want to do is you take your canola

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.880 
want to do is you take your canola
plants<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.840> try<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.350> find<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
plants that you have and try to find the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.520 
plants that you have and try to find the
main<00:02:57.250> Racine<00:02:57.760> usually<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.050> most<00:02:59.260> canola

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
main Racine usually with most canola

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.560 
main Racine usually with most canola
plants<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.070> main<00:03:00.220> Racine<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:01.300> first

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
plants the main Racine the first

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.199 
plants the main Racine the first
flowering<00:03:02.200> branch<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.550> going<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.850> have<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
flowering branch is is going to have the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.180 
flowering branch is is going to have the
majority<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.750> yield<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.709> that's<00:03:06.010> always

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
majority of the yield so that's always

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.130 
majority of the yield so that's always
going<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.459> be<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.180> most<00:03:07.270> central<00:03:07.660> one<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
going to be the the most central one so

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
going to be the the most central one so
the<00:03:08.770> easiest<00:03:09.040> way<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.310> find<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.670> most<00:03:09.820> central

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the easiest way to find the most central

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.630 
the easiest way to find the most central
one<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.510> bend<00:03:10.750> down<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.800> secondary

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
one is to bend down the the secondary

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.210 
one is to bend down the the secondary
branches<00:03:12.850> first<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.800> you're<00:03:14.950> left<00:03:15.100> with

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
branches first and here you're left with

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.050 
branches first and here you're left with
the<00:03:15.340> main<00:03:15.520> Racine<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:17.650> determine<00:03:18.100> whether

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
the main Racine and to determine whether

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.760 
the main Racine and to determine whether
or<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.239> you're<00:03:19.540> ready<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.870> swathe<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.530> is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
or not you're ready to swathe this is

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.140 
or not you're ready to swathe this is
you<00:03:21.640> need<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.970> do<00:03:22.090> sample<00:03:22.810> pods<00:03:23.200> from<00:03:24.150> three

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you need to do sample pods from three

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.479 
you need to do sample pods from three
different<00:03:25.299> parts<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.950> Racine<00:03:27.250> so

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
different parts of the of the Racine so

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.470 
different parts of the of the Racine so
the<00:03:27.610> bottom<00:03:28.299> middle<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.750> top<00:03:29.049> components<00:03:29.920> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the bottom middle and top components and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.780 
the bottom middle and top components and
then<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:31.660> we<00:03:31.750> want<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.049> do<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.440> need<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.519> zoom

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
then what we want to do is need to zoom

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.110 
then what we want to do is need to zoom
in<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:35.489> what<00:03:36.489> do<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.580> want<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.820> do<00:03:36.940> is

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
in on this what do you want to do is

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.660 
in on this what do you want to do is
just<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.360> break<00:03:37.510> these<00:03:37.690> pods<00:03:37.959> open<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.709> take<00:03:39.640> a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
just to break these pods open and take a

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.520 
just to break these pods open and take a
look<00:03:39.880> at<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> seeds<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.480> are<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.260> are<00:03:41.410> in

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
look at the seeds that are that are in

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.120 
look at the seeds that are that are in
here<00:03:42.330> like<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.420> said<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.799> not<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
here like I said this is this is not the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.130 
here like I said this is this is not the
appropriate<00:03:45.220> stage<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.970> be<00:03:46.090> doing<00:03:46.810> your<00:03:46.900> swath

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
appropriate stage to be doing your swath

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.810 
appropriate stage to be doing your swath
timing<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:47.739> if<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:47.980> were<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
timing but if you were in this in the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.580 
timing but if you were in this in the
field<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.150> do<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:50.019> want<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.230> look<00:03:50.350> at<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
field to do that you want to look at the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.380 
field to do that you want to look at the
number<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.950> seeds<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.940> have<00:03:52.060> actually

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
number of seeds that have actually

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.130 
number of seeds that have actually
changed<00:03:52.600> color<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.970> any<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:56.080> of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
changed color to do that is any one of

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.990 
changed color to do that is any one of
these<00:03:56.290> seeds<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.590> show<00:03:56.890> any<00:03:57.280> amount<00:03:57.790> of

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
these seeds that show any amount of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.390 
these seeds that show any amount of
browning<00:03:58.600> on<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.959> would<00:03:59.590> be<00:03:59.739> considered<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.370> be

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
browning on it would be considered to be

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.900 
browning on it would be considered to be
one<00:04:00.760> see<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.180> has<00:04:01.330> changed<00:04:01.930> color<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
one see that has changed color the the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.570 
one see that has changed color the the
threshold<00:04:04.390> for<00:04:04.930> making<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.920> dis<00:04:06.100> actually

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
threshold for making to dis actually

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580 
threshold for making to dis actually
swath<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.320> 60%<00:04:08.320> seed<00:04:08.890> color<00:04:09.070> change<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.930> 60%<00:04:10.930> is

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590

five from this part of the field go to

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.360 
five from this part of the field go to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
the opposite corner do about five

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.159 
the opposite corner do about five

samples within the field get a good crop

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.340 
samples within the field get a good crop
across<00:04:56.760> representation<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.910> then<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.750> will

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
across representation and then that will

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.990 
across representation and then that will

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
help you in making that decision as to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.180 
help you in making that decision as to
whether<00:05:01.360> or<00:05:01.419> not<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.750> are<00:05:01.780> at<00:05:02.169> that<00:05:02.350> 60%<00:05:02.710> seed

whether or not you are at that 60% seed
color<00:05:03.370> change<00:05:03.699> if<00:05:04.449> we're<00:05:04.720> finding<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.500> our

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
color change if we're finding that our

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.730 
color change if we're finding that our
crop<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.270> we're<00:05:07.570> actually<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.990> quite<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.290> bit<00:05:08.530> we

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
crop is we're actually in quite a bit we

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.100 
crop is we're actually in quite a bit we
still<00:05:09.040> ignore<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.550> branches<00:05:10.000> ah<00:05:10.210> yeah<00:05:10.840> great

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
still ignore the branches ah yeah great

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.610 
still ignore the branches ah yeah great
question

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
question

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.580 
question
so<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:12.669> year<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:14.050> other<00:05:14.320> years

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
so this year and and in other years

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.290 
so this year and and in other years
sometimes<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.190> might<00:05:15.370> find<00:05:15.669> that<00:05:15.880> your<00:05:16.090> main

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
sometimes you might find that your main

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.110 
sometimes you might find that your main
flowering<00:05:16.810> regime<00:05:17.260> or<00:05:17.500> main<00:05:17.820> plodding<00:05:18.820> branch

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
flowering regime or main plodding branch

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.930 
flowering regime or main plodding branch
has<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> bunch<00:05:20.380> of<00:05:20.500> aborted<00:05:20.830> pods<00:05:21.160> on<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:21.729> a

lot<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.540> pods<00:05:22.750> might<00:05:23.050> actually<00:05:23.229> be<00:05:24.810> not

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
lot of the pods might actually be not

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.430 
lot of the pods might actually be not
looking<00:05:26.050> like<00:05:26.169> they're<00:05:26.289> gonna<00:05:26.380> be

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
looking like they're gonna be

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.250 
looking like they're gonna be
contributing<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.310> all<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.639> much<00:05:27.789> yield<00:05:28.260> so

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
contributing to all that much yield so

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.020 
contributing to all that much yield so
what<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.530> need<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.800> do<00:05:29.919> then<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.760> start

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
what you need to do then is to start

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.790 
what you need to do then is to start
looking<00:05:31.270> at<00:05:31.360> those<00:05:31.570> secondary<00:05:31.990> branches<00:05:32.260> try

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
looking at those secondary branches try

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.770 
looking at those secondary branches try
to<00:05:32.860> decide<00:05:33.250> which<00:05:33.550> which<00:05:34.120> branches<00:05:34.539> are<00:05:34.660> going

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
to decide which which branches are going

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.600 
to decide which which branches are going

that main Racine but if you have a low
plant<00:05:46.300> stand<00:05:46.630> you<00:05:46.930> only<00:05:47.080> have<00:05:47.229> two<00:05:47.830> or<00:05:47.860> three

that's<00:05:54.010> in<00:05:54.729> that<00:05:54.970> crop<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:55.930> maybe<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.830> will

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
that's in that crop and so maybe it will

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.320 
that's in that crop and so maybe it will
be<00:05:57.099> those<00:05:57.250> side<00:05:57.460> branches<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.060> you'll<00:05:58.180> need

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
be those side branches that you'll need

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.270 
be those side branches that you'll need
