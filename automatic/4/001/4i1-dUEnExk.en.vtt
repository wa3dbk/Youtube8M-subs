00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:22.519
 here's a film order mkb-10 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:24.830
 time by the window the first days of August is coming up 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.720
 the end of the summer legs have long been back from 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.369
 vacations and sit comfortably not 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.820
 computers enjoying the latest 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 of days of rest not Victor Vance 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.310
 resting because marty james reloaded 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.620
 his work and I maxim you all 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.260
 welcome in general march i decided 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.730
 today get rid of competitors and us 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.250
 need to destroy three trucks 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.520
 mexicans before he gave us 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.100
 grenades so i think it will be easy 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.110
 but every truck 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.330
 guards 2 mexicans besides after 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.460
 2 van wrecks hack 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.580
 gangsters and try to kill you 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.380
 but more on that a little later now the main thing 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.110
 find out how best to kill these 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.120
 guys that guard the van I personally 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
 I recommend just simply crush them 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.460
 This is the best option so you do not spend 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.860
 not health and ammo save but 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.560
 maybe you want to shoot 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.230
 In this case, stop meters 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 so for ten thugs and neatly 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.090
 move forward until they get hooked 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 auto-shot then shoot anything 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.159
 complex van destroy the easiest 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the struts opposite and throw a grenade 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.290
 but when you come out mexicans 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.970
 you just need to let them destroy your 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.420
 the car immediately you run and are looking for a new 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.520
 further the mexicans will follow you but but 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.580
 here you can either kill them or just 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 not go after you will not chase only 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.710
 that's what we do it for in general 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.200
 March just wants to prove a competitor 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.840
 what to compete with him useless he 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 and wants to teach them a lesson for the whole business you 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.640
 but many of his gangs are simply capturing 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 his business or open his on his 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.700
 territories we need them today just 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.069
 just to teach 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.730
 how of course it is completely their not 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 will stop 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.220
 but they will know who's in charge 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.830
 although she stroked and mexicans and felony 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.379
 annoyed and brands are generally looking guys 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.989
 problems on the ass in fact it's kind of like 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.989
 strong bandar meet such things but 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.120
 I think they will not last long and the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.849
 time we drive up the last van 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.489
 here guys are nothing complicated at all 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.080
 after that the mission will be completed by all 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.879
