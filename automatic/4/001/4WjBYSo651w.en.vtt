00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
nice fine this is a Thermax AF it's a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.129 
nice fine this is a Thermax AF it's a
combination<00:00:06.420> vacuum<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.700> carpet<00:00:08.700> cleaner<00:00:09.139> or

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
spray cleaner so this does two things

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.970 
spray cleaner so this does two things
and<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:14.340> found<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> yard<00:00:15.240> sale<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
and we found this at a yard sale and it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.160

you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.899> under<00:00:34.140> pressure<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you can see that it's under pressure and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.299 
you can see that it's under pressure and
this<00:00:35.460> goes<00:00:35.700> back<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:37.140> pressure<00:00:37.890> hookup

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
this goes back down to a pressure hookup

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.520 
this goes back down to a pressure hookup
here<00:00:38.660> right<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.989> where<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:40.320> the

to this pose here you see where it plugs
in<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.300> held<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.780> place<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.790> how<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
in and it's held in place that's how it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.030 
in and it's held in place that's how it
gets<00:02:52.150> power<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> beater<00:02:55.240> bar<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:59.040> plugs

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
gets power for the beater bar this plugs

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.580 
gets power for the beater bar this plugs
into<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:03.510> okay<00:03:04.540> that's<00:03:04.780> locked<00:03:05.020> in<00:03:05.230> now<00:03:05.380> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
into here okay that's locked in now and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.260 
into here okay that's locked in now and
then<00:03:06.130> we'll<00:03:06.310> turn<00:03:06.460> this<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:06.850> you'll<00:03:07.120> be

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
then we'll turn this on and you'll be

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:20.040 
then we'll turn this on and you'll be
able<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.480> see<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.870> works

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.660 

we<00:03:21.050> did<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.470> include<00:03:21.800> this<00:03:21.980> video<00:03:22.340> since

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
we did want to include this video since

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.150 
we did want to include this video since
you<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:22.940> see<00:03:23.150> everything<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:24.050> we<00:03:24.800> see<00:03:25.010> that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
you can see everything that we see that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.330 
you can see everything that we see that
is<00:03:25.220> wrong<00:03:25.490> with<00:03:25.520> it<00:03:25.990> such<00:03:26.990> as<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.100> tape

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
is wrong with it such as the the tape

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.370 
is wrong with it such as the the tape
which<00:03:28.640> basically<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.209> think<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.630> an<00:03:29.750> easy<00:03:30.020> fix

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
which basically I think is an easy fix

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.580 
which basically I think is an easy fix
and<00:03:31.390> other<00:03:32.390> than<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:33.050> mean<00:03:33.170> it's<00:03:33.440> in

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and other than that I mean it's in

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.230 
and other than that I mean it's in
fairly<00:03:33.920> good<00:03:33.950> shape<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.490> looks<00:03:34.670> clean<00:03:34.940> and

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
fairly good shape it looks clean and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.870 
fairly good shape it looks clean and
that<00:03:36.110> sort<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.410> thing<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.610> have<00:03:37.730> any

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
that sort of thing so if you have any

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.750 
that sort of thing so if you have any
questions<00:03:38.410> make<00:03:39.410> sure<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:40.040> messages

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
questions make sure that you messages

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.870 
questions make sure that you messages
and<00:03:41.420> just<00:03:41.660> ask
