gets a team at we just saw in the
previous<00:01:46.500> game<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.189> my<00:01:47.369> Mraz<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
previous game for my Mraz well is this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
previous game for my Mraz well is this
now<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> standard<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> renekton<00:01:50.100> sin

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
now the standard for the renekton sin

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
now the standard for the renekton sin
that<00:01:50.340> top<00:01:50.549> line<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> advantage<00:01:51.810> yeah

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that top line to get the advantage yeah

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
that top line to get the advantage yeah
of<00:01:52.890> course<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.490> even<00:01:54.149> mundo<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:55.049> TP

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of course like even mundo like TP

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.399 
of course like even mundo like TP

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
somewhere unlost match farm he can

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.639 
somewhere unlost match farm he can
pretty<00:01:58.649> much<00:01:58.880> one<00:01:59.880> versus<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.649> renekton

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
pretty much one versus one renekton

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.240 
pretty much one versus one renekton
honda<00:02:01.950> line<00:02:02.149> if<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.570> didn't<00:02:03.869> work<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.170> so

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
honda line if that didn't work out so

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
honda line if that didn't work out so
good<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.549> happening<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.909> midland

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
good and that's happening at midland

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
good and that's happening at midland
water<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.780> been<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> lane<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> focus

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
water would have been the lane to focus

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.350 
water would have been the lane to focus
for<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.869> know<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.080> wanted<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
for you know we wanted to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.200 
for you know we wanted to
like<00:02:11.570> snowball<00:02:12.380> top<00:02:12.740> lane<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.190> was<00:02:13.640> supposed<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
like snowball top lane I was supposed to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.750 
like snowball top lane I was supposed to
like<00:02:14.690> sit<00:02:14.990> here<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.770> kill<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.310> few<00:02:16.550> times

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
like sit here and just kill so few times

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.030 
like sit here and just kill so few times
but<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.330> wasn't<00:02:17.660> necessary<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.410> we<00:02:18.800> got<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
but it wasn't necessary like we got a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.030 
but it wasn't necessary like we got a
kill<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.490> Ziggs<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.770> renekton<00:02:21.770> killed

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
kill on Ziggs and then renekton killed

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.970 
kill on Ziggs and then renekton killed
one<00:02:22.640> versus<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.270> well<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.960> we<00:02:24.230> took<00:02:24.530> drags

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
one versus one as well so we took drags

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.430 
one versus one as well so we took drags
and<00:02:25.280> such<00:02:25.640> things<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.570> speaking<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> drag

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
and such things and speaking of the drag

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.560 
and such things and speaking of the drag
Hopsin<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.860> took<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.130> Baron<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:29.000> guys<00:02:29.210> we've

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
Hopsin you took the Baron you guys we've

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.750 
Hopsin you took the Baron you guys we've
noticed<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.650> many<00:02:31.010> matches<00:02:31.460> when<00:02:31.640> you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
noticed this in many matches when you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730 
noticed this in many matches when you
have<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> baron<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.870> tend<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.170> push<00:02:33.320> all<00:02:33.500> three

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
have a baron you tend to push all three

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.800 
have a baron you tend to push all three
lanes<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> particular<00:02:35.060> focus<00:02:35.450> just

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
lanes is there a particular focus just

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.180 
lanes is there a particular focus just
to<00:02:35.870> keep<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.140> pressure<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.620> or<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.070> just

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to keep that pressure on or is it just

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.949 
to keep that pressure on or is it just
thinking<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:38.060> got<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.330> advantage<00:02:38.450> let's

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
thinking in we got the advantage let's

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.480 
thinking in we got the advantage let's
just<00:02:39.140> take<00:02:39.290> everything<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.709> can<00:02:39.890> well<00:02:40.280> we'll

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
just take everything we can well we'll

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.670 
just take everything we can well we'll
look<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:40.940> door<00:02:41.120> peaks<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.990> one<00:02:42.320> versus

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
look at door peaks and like one versus

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.310 
look at door peaks and like one versus
one<00:02:42.709> potential<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.300> usually<00:02:44.480> let<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
one potential so we usually let the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.710 
one potential so we usually let the
stronger<00:02:45.830> service<00:02:46.190> push<00:02:46.459> one<00:02:47.090> line<00:02:47.360> maybe

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
stronger service push one line maybe

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.080 
stronger service push one line maybe
like<00:02:48.050> zazzle's<00:02:48.590> go<00:02:48.830> tub<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.550> kazakh

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
like zazzle's go tub and the kazakh

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.390 
like zazzle's go tub and the kazakh
robot<00:02:50.510> because<00:02:51.050> no<00:02:51.080> one<00:02:51.380> can<00:02:51.620> one<00:02:52.010> versus<00:02:52.370> one

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
robot because no one can one versus one

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.210 
robot because no one can one versus one
then<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:53.660> pressure<00:02:54.050> mid<00:02:54.320> lane<00:02:54.500> then

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
then and we just pressure mid lane then

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.979 
then and we just pressure mid lane then
of<00:02:55.340> course<00:02:55.370> moving<00:02:56.000> on<00:02:56.120> from<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.570> game<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
of course moving on from the game you

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.960 
of course moving on from the game you
guys<00:02:57.140> now<00:02:57.440> joint<00:02:58.010> top<00:02:58.310> you're<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.760> there

feel<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.690> traveling<00:03:03.170> may<00:03:03.320> weigh<00:03:03.530> down

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
feel that the traveling may weigh down

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.840 
feel that the traveling may weigh down

week<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:47.930> not<00:03:48.049> sure<00:03:48.140> how<00:03:48.230> much<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> take

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
week so I'm not sure how much to take

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.720 
week so I'm not sure how much to take
from<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.100> because<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.400> guys<00:03:49.549> just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
from that because you guys just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.180 
from that because you guys just
destroyed<00:03:50.090> them<00:03:50.239> as<00:03:50.360> well<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:51.260> millennion

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
destroyed them as well but millennion

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.880

themselves<00:03:52.820> really<00:03:53.510> dodgy<00:03:53.750> teamfight<00:03:54.530> still

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
themselves really dodgy teamfight still

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.440

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.729 
so I actually think Alliance may well
