00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
to show how quickly they start and maybe

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.830 
to show how quickly they start and maybe
go<00:01:24.789> and<00:01:25.030> demonstrate<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.659> few<00:01:25.840> but<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.890> um<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
go and demonstrate a few but so um you

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.169 
go and demonstrate a few but so um you

might have noticed that garage back side
rather<00:01:34.420> quickly<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.229> can<00:01:35.409> just<00:01:35.560> go

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
rather quickly and you can just go

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.819 
rather quickly and you can just go
through<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.250> select<00:01:36.429> an<00:01:36.729> instrument<00:01:37.329> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
through and select an instrument and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.580

everything<00:01:38.829> is<00:01:38.979> smooth<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.460> fast<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.579> pull

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
everything is smooth and fast then pull

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.679 
everything is smooth and fast then pull
simple<00:01:44.590> application<00:01:45.280> Twitter<00:01:48.509> nothing<00:01:49.509> too

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
simple application Twitter nothing too

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.069 
simple application Twitter nothing too
demanding<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.320> guess<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:52.719> then<00:01:53.079> there's<00:01:53.380> GTA

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
demanding I guess and then there's GTA

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.980 
demanding I guess and then there's GTA
which<00:01:56.369> works<00:01:57.369> quite<00:01:57.789> well<00:01:57.819> so<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.869> I'm

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
which works quite well so think I'm

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.450 
which works quite well so think I'm
going<00:02:02.109> to<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.350> cut<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.740> here<00:02:03.009> until<00:02:03.340> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
going to have to cut it here until it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.370 
going to have to cut it here until it
starts<00:02:03.939> because<00:02:04.179> I<00:02:04.299> haven't<00:02:04.509> used<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:05.079> just

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
starts because I haven't used is just

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.400 
starts because I haven't used is just
installed<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.920> for<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.189> purposes<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.759> the
