from<00:00:22.949> phone<00:00:23.220> reading<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.789> you're

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
from phone reading here and you're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.689 
from phone reading here and you're
watching<00:00:24.090> our<00:00:24.480> video<00:00:24.810> review<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.699> basis

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
watching our video review of the basis

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
watching our video review of the basis
peak<00:00:27.140> we've<00:00:28.140> seen<00:00:28.289> better<00:00:28.500> designs<00:00:28.859> than<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
peak we've seen better designs than this

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
peak we've seen better designs than this
and<00:00:29.580> quite<00:00:29.730> frankly<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.539> pales<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.230> comparison

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
and quite frankly it pales in comparison

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.430 
and quite frankly it pales in comparison
to<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> Fitbit<00:00:32.700> surge<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.840> dull<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to the Fitbit surge it's just dull and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
to the Fitbit surge it's just dull and
blocky<00:00:34.800> looking<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.059> gotta<00:00:36.210> give<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
blocky looking but we gotta give a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
blocky looking but we gotta give a
credit<00:00:36.719> though<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> solid

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
credit though it has a solid

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
credit though it has a solid
construction<00:00:38.879> because<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.360> made<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.840> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
construction because it's made out of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
construction because it's made out of
this<00:00:40.550> forged<00:00:41.550> aluminum<00:00:42.090> material<00:00:42.210> which

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this forged aluminum material which

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.270 
this forged aluminum material which
gives<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.350> almost<00:00:43.530> indestructible

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
gives it an almost indestructible

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
gives it an almost indestructible
quality<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.690> same<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.289> withstand<00:00:47.160> being

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
quality at same time to withstand being

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
quality at same time to withstand being
underwater<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.450> deep<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.960> 50<00:00:49.559> meters<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
underwater as deep as 50 meters so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
underwater as deep as 50 meters so
that's<00:00:50.340> pretty<00:00:50.550> good<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that's pretty good and we do like the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.549 
that's pretty good and we do like the
silicone<00:00:53.250> strap<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.910> comes<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> 3d

rubbery<00:00:57.539> feel<00:00:57.780> does<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.469> job<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
rubbery feel does a great job of

though the operation is kind of finicky
just<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.420> you've<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.899> these

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
chronological order now like I said it's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.750 
chronological order now like I said it's
very<00:02:39.510> detailed<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.500> shows<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.400> your

very detailed it shows you your your
data<00:02:42.060> very<00:02:42.599> well<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:43.319> unfortunately<00:02:43.440> there's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
data very well but unfortunately there's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.130 
data very well but unfortunately there's
no<00:02:44.340> monthly<00:02:44.760> view<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> really<00:02:45.870> can't

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
no monthly view so you really can't

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.890 
no monthly view so you really can't
track<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.709> progress<00:02:47.010> over<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> month's<00:02:48.599> time

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
track your progress over a month's time
period<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:50.549> center<00:02:50.760> process<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.239> pretty

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
period the center process is pretty

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.770 
period the center process is pretty
simple<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.890> generally<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.459> 20<00:02:54.150> feet<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.510> range

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
simple we generally get 20 feet of range

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.259 
simple we generally get 20 feet of range
with<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.379> we<00:02:55.890> connected<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> an<00:02:56.609> iPhone<00:02:56.970> 6

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
with it we connected it to an iPhone 6

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.930 
with it we connected it to an iPhone 6
plus<00:02:57.480> now<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> also<00:02:58.560> features<00:02:59.040> some<00:02:59.310> smart

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
plus now it also features some smart

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.400 
plus now it also features some smart
functions<00:03:00.540> as<00:03:00.690> well<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.319> have

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
functions as well so you have

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.460 
functions as well so you have
notifications<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:03.150> text<00:03:03.660> messages<00:03:04.140> your

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
calendar reminders and phone calls now

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.349 
calendar reminders and phone calls now
basis<00:03:07.650> says<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.310> has<00:03:08.489> also<00:03:08.790> email

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
basis says that it has also email

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.930 
basis says that it has also email
notifications<00:03:10.109> but<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.650> our<00:03:10.829> experience<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
notifications but in our experience it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.210 
notifications but in our experience it
didn't<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.540> work<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.920> single<00:03:14.069> greatest

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
didn't really work the single greatest

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
didn't really work the single greatest
thing<00:03:14.430> about<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.060> basis<00:03:15.390> peak<00:03:15.629> is<00:03:15.840> that

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
thing about the basis peak is that

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.349 
thing about the basis peak is that
offers<00:03:16.470> minimal<00:03:16.920> interaction<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.060> we<00:03:18.180> just

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
offers minimal interaction so we just

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.900 
offers minimal interaction so we just
wear<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.440> sensors<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:19.889> are<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:20.819> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
wear it and the sensors that are in the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.360 
wear it and the sensors that are in the
inside<00:03:21.239> knows<00:03:21.720> what<00:03:22.349> kind<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.650> activity<00:03:23.160> we're

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
inside knows what kind of activity we're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.309 
inside knows what kind of activity we're
doing<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:23.849> for<00:03:24.090> walking<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.959> knows<00:03:25.139> we're

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
doing so for walking and knows we're

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.140 
doing so for walking and knows we're
walking<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.950> we're<00:03:26.099> running<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.760> knows<00:03:26.940> we're

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
walking and we're running it knows we're

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.120 
walking and we're running it knows we're

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.879 
running and if we're sleeping it knows
that<00:03:29.160> too<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.090> no<00:03:30.750> no<00:03:31.200> sort<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.829> know

manual operation necessary and our end

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.000 
manual operation necessary and our end
now<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.669> quite<00:03:36.139> sensitive<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.470> notice<00:03:37.769> it

now it's quite sensitive and notice it

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.710 
now it's quite sensitive and notice it
even<00:03:38.040> knows<00:03:38.370> how<00:03:38.639> many<00:03:38.730> times<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.150> toss<00:03:39.450> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
even knows how many times we toss and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.110 
even knows how many times we toss and
turn<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:39.959> our<00:03:40.169> sleep<00:03:40.470> however<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.400> also<00:03:41.669> falls

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
turn in our sleep however it also falls

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.690 
turn in our sleep however it also falls
victim<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.959> those<00:03:43.079> phantoms<00:03:43.709> step<00:03:44.040> tracking

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
victim to those phantoms step tracking

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.520 
victim to those phantoms step tracking
so<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.060> wave<00:03:45.269> our<00:03:45.299> hand<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.900> thinks<00:03:46.500> that

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
so if we wave our hand it thinks that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.800 
so if we wave our hand it thinks that
we're<00:03:46.769> walking<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.549> records<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.329> as<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> step

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
we're walking so records it as a step

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750 
we're walking so records it as a step
but<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.799> something<00:03:50.099> we've<00:03:50.220> seen<00:03:50.430> an<00:03:50.579> other

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
but that's something we've seen an other

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970 
but that's something we've seen an other
fitness<00:03:51.269> tracker<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.200> results<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.769> be<00:03:52.829> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
fitness tracker so the results can be a

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.470 
fitness tracker so the results can be a
little<00:03:53.220> bit<00:03:53.400> more<00:03:53.639> generous<00:03:54.060> than<00:03:54.269> you'd

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
little bit more generous than you'd

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.500 
little bit more generous than you'd
think<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:55.099> this<00:03:56.099> kind<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.459> fitness<00:03:57.120> tracker
