just<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.320> like<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.430> put<00:02:03.820> down<00:02:04.030> or<00:02:06.509> hop<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:08.310> or

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
just go like that put down or hop in or

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.180 
just go like that put down or hop in or
actually<00:02:10.350> hop<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:13.050> well<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.200> know<00:02:14.320> when<00:02:15.100> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
actually hop in well you know when you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.729 
actually hop in well you know when you
get<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.700> try<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:15.970> three<00:02:16.600> tap<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.140> you

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
get on it a try it three tap if you

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.100 
get on it a try it three tap if you
don't<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> idea<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.640> tap<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.989> should

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
don't like the idea of tap in you should

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.530 
don't like the idea of tap in you should
probably<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.440> go<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:20.709> threes<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:22.120> three

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
probably just go for threes but three

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
probably just go for threes but three
you<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:22.989> need<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.230> know<00:02:23.350> how<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.530> 364<00:02:24.280> lat<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
you don't need to know how to 364 lat to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.210 
you don't need to know how to 364 lat to
do<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> 540<00:02:25.450> tie<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.190> basically<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:29.220> if

with pulling up first and I finally

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.250 
with pulling up first and I finally
makes<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.010> harder<00:03:36.370> unless<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.569> talk<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.989> lot

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
is land and then when I used to try and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.510 
is land and then when I used to try and
pull<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.020> used<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.410> turn<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.920> sign<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.310> felt

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
pull I used to turn to the sign it felt

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.930 
pull I used to turn to the sign it felt
weird<00:04:08.730> all<00:04:09.540> right<00:04:09.750> before<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.770> pores<00:04:11.760> are<00:04:11.880> the

touchdown<00:05:07.020> manual<00:05:07.919> 18<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.880> don't<00:05:09.000> need<00:05:09.180> to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
touchdown manual 18 is you don't need to

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.570 
touchdown manual 18 is you don't need to
do<00:05:09.390> them<00:05:09.540> but<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:10.800> could<00:05:10.950> also<00:05:11.100> try<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.430> get

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
do them but you could also try and get

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.970 
do them but you could also try and get
my<00:05:11.700> nose<00:05:11.880> down<00:05:12.030> cuz<00:05:12.780> if<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.900> manual<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.590> then

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
my nose down cuz if you manual and then

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.870 
my nose down cuz if you manual and then
180<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:15.169> it's<00:05:16.169> kind<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.710> like<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.460> five<00:05:17.669> top

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
180 and it's kind of like the five top

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.450 
180 and it's kind of like the five top
because<00:05:18.480> when<00:05:18.600> you<00:05:18.690> three<00:05:18.960> tap<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> bat

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
because when you three tap and a bat

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.200 
because when you three tap and a bat
wheel<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:22.020> then<00:05:22.140> hop<00:05:22.530> out<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.220> hot<00:05:23.730> pipe<00:05:23.910> it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
wheel and then hop out the hot pipe it

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.900 
wheel and then hop out the hot pipe it
to<00:05:24.780> turn<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.370> like<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.669> manual<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:27.750> it
