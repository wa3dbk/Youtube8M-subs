00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.840
 hello everyone thanks for watching another video 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.089
 more than latin gamers today 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.860
 I bring a very special top and that is that 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.020
 Today 's top 5 is dedicated to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.840
 female characters of video games 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.460
 What has captivated us the most is that 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.710
 video game industry is one of the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.990
 few where there is gender equality 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.359
 since there are women behind the development 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.650
 of our favorite video games 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.660
 there are also women within 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.120
 videogames which take the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.950
 protagonism of the story for them and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.540
 there are also women who could give us 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.570
 a lesson in any game 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.830
 multiplayer for this reason this cap is 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.020
 very special we start with him in fifth 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.180
 place we have stepped on the princess of 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.100
 mario bros world which was one of 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.590
 the first female characters in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.420
 appear in a video game peas was the 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.790
 typical stereotype of the damsel in 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.740
 troubles which was taken by the bad guy 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.680
 the story and we as a hero 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.420
 we must rescue her yet she has earned 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 the admiration and respect of all the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.030
 gamer community and that's why it stays with 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.510
 the fifth 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 in fourth place we have samus aran 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 protagonist of the saga metroid this 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 character is very special since it was the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.549
 first woman to star in a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 video game what for the era in which 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.750
 premiered something was misunderstood a fact 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.909
 curious is that in the first game of the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 aguas abu spent the whole game with his 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 so particular costume which prevented 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.170
 we recognized it after arriving at 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 end of the fire after so much action 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.520
 and so many shots is that we discover that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.710
 the character that we use throughout 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.300
 fire was a woman something that left in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 shock to several of those who passed the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.190
 game in third place we have the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.259
 princess zelda which is one of the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.990
 most popular female characters of 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.179
 the videogames at the beginning of the saga 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.950
 which bears his name is another damsel 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.679
 in distress which the brave link should 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.869
 save however in the most games 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.569
 recent of the saga has helped the link 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.940
 in some fights still it's still 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.160
 a very popular character so much that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 although it does not star in the saga if it carries 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.220
 his name and that's why he is in third 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.010
 place 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.570
 in second place we have elizabeth a 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.940
 of the protagonists of baio shock 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.430
 infinite although it is also typical 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.990
 damsel we must rescue in many 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.600
 chances are she who ends 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.190
 rescuing them to us in addition to the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.470
 great relationship that engages with the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.330
 main character makes her be 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.460
 one of the most loved characters of the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.310
 video games and that's why it remains with the 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.500
 second place in our first place 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.810
 we went from damsels in distress to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.670
 heroines and is that the first place of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.709
 this top is occupied by lara croft la 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.900
 star of the whole saga tomb raider 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.230
 and is that when he won it he is exploring 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.640
 the world is saving him from evil 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.920
 protecting it from the evil minds that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 they want to seize it is very weird 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.910
 see a female character like that of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.600
 lara croft why that makes her so special 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.240
 and that's why it ranks first 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.940
