and at that time Harvard had just built
the<00:00:50.430> stadium<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> couldn't<00:00:51.540> literally

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the stadium and you couldn't literally

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.490 
the stadium and you couldn't literally
go<00:00:52.769> east<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.760> west<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:54.989> authorized

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
go east or west on it so they authorized

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
go east or west on it so they authorized
the<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.280> forward<00:00:56.850> pass<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> joke<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.780> as

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the the forward pass and the joke was as

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.299 
the the forward pass and the joke was as
a<00:00:57.960> carving<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.470> 40<00:00:58.800> years<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> actually

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
a carving of the 40 years to actually

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.499 
a carving of the 40 years to actually
use<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:04.070> because<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.399> only<00:01:05.460> seats<00:01:05.759> 30,000

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
use it because it only seats 30,000

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.690 
use it because it only seats 30,000
there<00:01:06.540> were<00:01:06.660> not<00:01:06.810> many<00:01:07.020> bad<00:01:07.380> seats<00:01:07.800> there<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
there were not many bad seats there so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.810 
there were not many bad seats there so
the<00:01:08.820> first<00:01:09.030> time<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.600> inside<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.350> probably

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the first time I got inside was probably

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.410 
the first time I got inside was probably
1962<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.930> amazing<00:01:13.320> men<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
1962 and what was amazing men was for

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
1962 and what was amazing men was for
many<00:01:15.660> many<00:01:15.930> games<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.009> either<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.430> least

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
many many games it was either at least

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
many many games it was either at least
twenty<00:01:17.970> twenty-five<00:01:18.450> thousand<00:01:19.050> or<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
twenty twenty-five thousand or for the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.870 
twenty twenty-five thousand or for the
most<00:01:20.130> part<00:01:20.399> full<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
most part full and I think one of the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.540 
most part full and I think one of the
things<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:25.740> people<00:01:26.039> liked<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.399> it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
things that that people liked about it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.120 
things that that people liked about it
is<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.240> intimacy<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:28.319> that<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
is there's an intimacy to it that you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
is there's an intimacy to it that you
don't<00:01:29.250> find<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.819> example<00:01:30.209> at<00:01:30.300> Yale<00:01:30.539> ball<00:01:30.869> were

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
don't find for example at Yale ball were

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.279 
don't find for example at Yale ball were
which<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.160> much<00:01:32.819> more<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.300> probably<00:01:33.810> 68

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
which which is much more is probably 68

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.339 
which which is much more is probably 68
thousand<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.509> course<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.959> then<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
thousand and of course back then the

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:41.089 
thousand and of course back then the
Dartmouth<00:01:37.740> game<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.190> always<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:40.099> it
