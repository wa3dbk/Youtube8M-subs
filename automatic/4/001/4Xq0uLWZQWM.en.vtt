they<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> toy<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> man<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
they want a toy and they want a man as a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.200 
they want a toy and they want a man as a
toy<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.920> mama's<00:01:38.369> boy<00:01:38.640> he's<00:01:38.939> looking

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
toy so then as mama's boy he's looking

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.020 
toy so then as mama's boy he's looking
for<00:01:39.240> mamas<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> no<00:01:40.140> mamas<00:01:40.439> happening<00:01:40.829> ok<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
for mamas and no mamas happening ok so I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
for mamas and no mamas happening ok so I
think<00:01:42.119> he<00:01:42.390> needs<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> grow<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.530> really

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think he needs to grow up or then really

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
think he needs to grow up or then really
go<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.280> someone<00:01:44.579> who's<00:01:44.759> maybe<00:01:45.090> semi

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
go for someone who's maybe semi

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
go for someone who's maybe semi
older<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.100> him<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.939> maybe<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.600> he

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
older than him so maybe you know if he

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
older than him so maybe you know if he
gets<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> role<00:01:49.320> opposite<00:01:49.740> way<00:01:50.009> car<00:01:50.369> somebody

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
