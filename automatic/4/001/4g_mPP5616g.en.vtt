00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.619 
video at 120 frames per second video and
it<00:02:43.849> looks<00:02:43.969> like<00:02:44.090> they're<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.389> be<00:02:44.480> trying

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
it looks like they're going to be trying

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.300 
it looks like they're going to be trying
to<00:02:44.750> port<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.079> to<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:45.469> Sony<00:02:45.709> Xperia<00:02:45.739> Z<00:02:46.280> ultra

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
that's not so much the case anymore if

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.290 
that's not so much the case anymore if
you've<00:04:45.470> approved<00:04:45.770> something<00:04:46.250> from<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.090> group

you've approved something from a group
of<00:04:47.450> permissions<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.620> whole<00:04:48.830> group<00:04:49.100> gets<00:04:49.490> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
of permissions that whole group gets the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.120 
of permissions that whole group gets the
ability<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.480> be<00:04:50.600> used<00:04:50.840> from<00:04:51.320> then<00:04:51.500> on<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.860> for

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
ability to be used from then on so for

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.920 
ability to be used from then on so for
example<00:04:52.220> if<00:04:52.490> they<00:04:52.580> put<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.910> one<00:04:53.510> permission

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
example if they put in one permission

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.450 
example if they put in one permission
from<00:04:54.080> one<00:04:54.350> group<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.830> seems<00:04:55.250> pretty

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
from one group that seems pretty

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.430 
from one group that seems pretty
innocuous<00:04:55.730> but<00:04:56.690> then<00:04:56.810> later<00:04:56.930> wanted<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.350> add

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
innocuous but then later wanted to add

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
innocuous but then later wanted to add
something<00:04:57.500> else<00:04:57.920> from<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.190> group<00:04:58.520> it's<00:04:59.150> not

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
something else from that group it's not

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.820 
something else from that group it's not
going<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.690> ask<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.990> about<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.380> there's<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.710> very

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
going to ask you about it there's a very

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.470 
going to ask you about it there's a very
long<00:05:01.040> very<00:05:01.190> detailed<00:05:01.610> article<00:05:01.790> on<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> portal

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
long very detailed article on the portal

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.030 
long very detailed article on the portal
talking<00:05:02.930> about<00:05:03.200> all<00:05:03.410> of<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.830> what

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
implications it has I think there are

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.180 
implications it has I think there are
actually<00:05:05.900> two<00:05:06.050> articles<00:05:06.440> related<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:07.040> but

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
actually two articles related to it but

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.070 
actually two articles related to it but

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
like they could be a problem but there

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.280 
like they could be a problem but there
could<00:05:25.670> be<00:05:25.730> other<00:05:26.030> other<00:05:26.510> permissions<00:05:26.990> that

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
could be other other permissions that

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.540 
could be other other permissions that
would<00:05:27.440> eventually<00:05:27.590> be<00:05:27.890> lumped<00:05:28.190> in<00:05:28.280> there<00:05:28.430> that

would eventually be lumped in there that

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.400 
would eventually be lumped in there that
could<00:05:28.580> become<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.060> problem<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.900> be<00:05:30.230> on<00:05:30.380> the
