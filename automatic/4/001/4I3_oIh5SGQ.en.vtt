saver<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.920> he<00:00:46.980> said<00:00:47.160> he's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> big<00:00:47.670> he's<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
saver and he said he's a big he's a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.290 
saver and he said he's a big he's a
heavy<00:00:48.210> dueler<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> he<00:00:50.489> said<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.239> know

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
heavy dueler and he said well you know

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.290 
heavy dueler and he said well you know
maybe<00:00:51.420> let's<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.899> another<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:54.000> got<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
maybe let's do another one and I got to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.689 
maybe let's do another one and I got to
thinking<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:55.230> well<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thinking you know well you know that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
thinking you know well you know that
seems<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.210> Elementary<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:57.960> him<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
seems a bit Elementary for him at this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.790 
seems a bit Elementary for him at this
point<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> proposed<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.840> idea<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
point and so I proposed the idea of a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.719 
point and so I proposed the idea of a
Dueling<00:01:02.670> Graflex<00:01:03.239> Anakin<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.860> something<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
Dueling Graflex Anakin so something that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
Dueling Graflex Anakin so something that
would<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.390> durable<00:01:06.600> than<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.110> standard

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
would be more durable than your standard

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.390 
would be more durable than your standard
Graflex<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> display<00:01:10.619> piece<00:01:10.860> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Graflex you know not a display piece but

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.780 
Graflex you know not a display piece but
an<00:01:11.820> Anakin<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.689> could<00:01:13.260> withstand<00:01:13.640> what<00:01:14.640> he

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
an Anakin that could withstand what he

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
an Anakin that could withstand what he
does<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.140> tried<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> come<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
does and so I tried to come up with that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
does and so I tried to come up with that
it<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> whole<00:01:18.869> new<00:01:18.900> chapter

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it has a kind of a whole new chapter

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.520 
it has a kind of a whole new chapter
design<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> chassis<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> definitely<00:01:22.380> not

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
design and the chassis is definitely not

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.179 
design and the chassis is definitely not
a<00:01:23.090> display<00:01:24.090> piece<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.200> looks<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.710> we'll

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a display piece or for looks but we'll

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
a display piece or for looks but we'll
get<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.850> second<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.720> get

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
get to that in just a second let's get

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
get to that in just a second let's get

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.310 
holes that I developed for Graflex
Anakin's<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.030> widely<00:02:26.360> used<00:02:26.540> technique<00:02:27.170> now

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
Anakin's it's widely used technique now

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.100 
Anakin's it's widely used technique now
and<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> that's<00:02:29.630> kind<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.020> cool<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.930> got

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
whole thing but that's not what makes it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.750 
whole thing but that's not what makes it
durable<00:03:38.750> it's<00:03:39.410> held<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.280> chassis<00:03:40.550> was

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
durable it's held in the chassis was

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.289 
durable it's held in the chassis was
actually<00:03:41.209> built<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:42.230> lock<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.790> it

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
actually built to lock it in and it

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.580 
actually built to lock it in and it
locks<00:03:44.570> in<00:03:44.870> with<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> zip<00:03:45.950> top<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:48.200> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
locks in with a zip top and so I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.420 
locks in with a zip top and so I
actually<00:03:48.980> think<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:49.610> show<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:51.430> topping

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
actually think I can show that topping

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.650 
actually think I can show that topping
this<00:03:52.610> yeah<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.830> there<00:03:54.830> we<00:03:54.860> go

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
this yeah I can there we go

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.759 
this yeah I can there we go
should<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.750> popped<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:57.019> recharge<00:03:57.380> port<00:03:57.650> down

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
should have popped a recharge port down

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.680 
should have popped a recharge port down
the<00:03:57.920> side<00:03:58.100> first<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:58.730> can<00:03:58.850> still<00:03:59.090> see<00:03:59.390> it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
the side first but you can still see it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.610 
the side first but you can still see it
it<00:04:00.049> runs<00:04:00.320> see<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.130> chassis<00:04:01.400> was<00:04:01.610> machined<00:04:02.620> so

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
it runs see that chassis was machined so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.960 
it runs see that chassis was machined so
that<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:05.600> runs<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.110> sits<00:04:06.290> flush<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:09.970> goes

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
that it runs and sits flush and goes

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.150 
that it runs and sits flush and goes
around<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.750> board<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.260> battery<00:04:12.590> combo<00:04:13.010> that

holds<00:04:13.519> it<00:04:13.610> in<00:04:13.730> place

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
holds it in place

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.259 
holds it in place
it's<00:04:14.660> nice<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.080> sturdy<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.410> have<00:04:15.880> gone<00:04:16.880> crazy

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it's nice and sturdy I have gone crazy
