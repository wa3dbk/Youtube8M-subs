00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
started playing although up until now

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
started playing although up until now
I've<00:00:46.710> only<00:00:46.890> really<00:00:47.190> used<00:00:47.460> blue-eyes<00:00:48.210> decks<00:00:48.600> or

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870

no side deck I have one card in it but

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.090 
no side deck I have one card in it but
that's<00:01:02.699> only<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.949> useful<00:01:04.949> at

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's only just because it's useful at

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's only just because it's useful at
times<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.670> looking<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:07.260> right

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
times but looking at that all right

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
times but looking at that all right
start<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> deck<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.850> 3<00:01:09.240> dark<00:01:09.960> blades
