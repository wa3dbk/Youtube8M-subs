00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
bit of this to add on to complexify the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.590 
bit of this to add on to complexify the
lips<00:03:08.859> that's<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.250> new<00:03:09.430> word<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:10.000> kind<00:03:10.299> of<00:03:10.359> in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
lips that's a new word it's kind of in

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.910 
lips that's a new word it's kind of in
certain<00:03:11.140> circles<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.590> make<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:11.829> this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
certain circles that make up this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.800 
certain circles that make up this
complexified<00:03:12.609> we're<00:03:13.030> gonna<00:03:13.120> complexify

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
complexified we're gonna complexify

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.190 
complexified we're gonna complexify
right<00:03:14.049> now<00:03:14.230> visit<00:03:14.530> my<00:03:14.590> data<00:03:15.239> okay<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.049> your

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
right now visit my data okay and on your

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.990 
right now visit my data okay and on your
side<00:03:17.380> okay<00:03:17.859> we're<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.130> eating<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.790> don't

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
side okay we're not eating it I don't

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.130 
side okay we're not eating it I don't
even<00:03:19.120> know<00:03:19.299> what<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.480> tastes<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.750> but<00:03:19.900> I'd

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
even know what it tastes like but I'd

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.599 
even know what it tastes like but I'd
imagine<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.620> tastes<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:20.950> play-doh<00:03:21.579> and

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
imagine it tastes like play-doh and

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.460 
imagine it tastes like play-doh and
Brussels<00:03:22.060> sprouts<00:03:22.329> okay<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.109> we<00:03:23.380> had

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
Brussels sprouts okay so I think we had

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.960 
Brussels sprouts okay so I think we had
the<00:03:23.560> basics<00:03:23.980> we're<00:03:24.160> obviously<00:03:24.640> we<00:03:24.730> have<00:03:24.850> our

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the basics we're obviously we have our

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.699 
the basics we're obviously we have our
blush<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.660> our<00:03:25.780> circle<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.230> life<00:03:26.410> we<00:03:26.620> have

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
blush we have our circle of life we have

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.680 
blush we have our circle of life we have
our<00:03:26.769> complexification<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.850> lips<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.299> think

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
our complexification of the lips I think

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.060 
our complexification of the lips I think
you<00:03:28.780> only<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.620> probably<00:03:29.950> do<00:03:30.010> a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you only have to do is probably do a
