I've probably lost the consensus as some

thing that would improve the world is if

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.910 
thing that would improve the world is if

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
they stopped doing the thing they're

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.430 
they stopped doing the thing they're

for<00:02:46.470> them<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.800> get<00:02:47.100> totally<00:02:47.550> behind<00:02:47.850> my<00:02:48.030> hole

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
for them to get totally behind my hole

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.910 
for them to get totally behind my hole
hoping<00:02:48.690> things<00:02:48.840> will<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.170> better<00:02:49.350> campaign

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

without making hypocrites of themselves

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.259 
without making hypocrites of themselves
and<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.410> can't<00:02:52.739> imagine<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.489> serial<00:02:54.060> killer

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
and I can't imagine a nice serial killer

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.460 
and I can't imagine a nice serial killer
wanting<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.489> consensus<00:02:56.489> lost<00:02:56.730> again

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
wanting to do that consensus lost again

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.470 
wanting to do that consensus lost again
so<00:02:58.470> let's<00:02:58.709> get<00:02:58.860> back<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.340> there's<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.940> lot<00:03:00.180> wrong
