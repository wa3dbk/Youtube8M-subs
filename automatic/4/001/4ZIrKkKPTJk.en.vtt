you know our client or my summer team
that<00:00:30.370> school<00:00:31.360> team<00:00:31.600> you<00:00:31.750> know<00:00:31.900> those<00:00:32.470> guys

that school team you know those guys

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.110 
that school team you know those guys
could<00:00:32.830> really<00:00:32.890> not<00:00:33.190> be<00:00:33.340> on<00:00:33.400> shots<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.910> I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
could really not be on shots and I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.790 
could really not be on shots and I
really<00:00:34.420> enjoy<00:00:34.600> passing<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.200> ball<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.380> seem<00:00:35.680> to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.670 
really enjoy passing the ball to seem to
make<00:00:35.890> shot<00:00:36.130> so<00:00:36.309> I<00:00:37.210> think<00:00:37.930> it's<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.290> big<00:00:38.440> part<00:00:38.650> of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
make shot so I think it's a big part of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.620 
make shot so I think it's a big part of
my<00:00:38.800> game<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:39.040> know<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.880> college<00:00:40.180> level<00:00:40.330> is<00:00:40.540> a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
my game you know the college level is a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.110 
my game you know the college level is a
lot<00:00:40.780> harder<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:41.290> lot<00:00:41.650> different<00:00:42.040> but<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.879> think

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
lot harder a lot different but I think

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.790 
lot harder a lot different but I think
I've<00:00:43.390> definitely<00:00:43.570> gotten<00:00:43.900> better<00:00:43.960> over<00:00:44.199> over

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
I've definitely gotten better over over
