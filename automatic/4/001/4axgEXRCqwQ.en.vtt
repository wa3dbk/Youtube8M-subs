00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
yep and if it's high which is 190 and I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.530 
yep and if it's high which is 190 and I
have<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.890> turn<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.190> out<00:02:19.340> well<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> said<00:02:20.360> while

you're<00:02:20.570> driving<00:02:21.080> you've<00:02:21.200> gotta<00:02:21.380> concentrate

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
you're driving you've gotta concentrate

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.560

on<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.190> sort<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.430> stuff<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.850> do<00:02:23.150> engine

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
on that sort of stuff and do engine

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.960 
on that sort of stuff and do engine
adjustments<00:02:24.110> wow<00:02:24.980> that's<00:02:25.370> pretty<00:02:25.490> hard<00:02:25.790> and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
adjustments wow that's pretty hard and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.640 
adjustments wow that's pretty hard and
also<00:02:26.240> imagine<00:02:26.930> there's<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.170> fair<00:02:27.470> bit<00:02:27.500> of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
also imagine there's a fair bit of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.080 
also imagine there's a fair bit of
technique<00:02:28.070> when<00:02:28.280> coming<00:02:28.670> into<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:28.970> of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
technique when coming into out of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.330 
technique when coming into out of
corners<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.570> straights<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> tell<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.250> about

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
corners and straights so tell you about

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.020 
corners and straights so tell you about
that<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.600> better<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.200> break<00:02:34.010> late<00:02:34.340> before

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that if it's better to break late before

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.060 
that if it's better to break late before
you<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.420> into<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> corner<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.710> way<00:02:36.830> it's

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
you going into a corner that way it's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.190 
you going into a corner that way it's
easier<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.700> come<00:02:37.850> out<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.720> can<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
easier to come out you can on the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.840 
easier to come out you can on the
straight<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.860> you've<00:02:40.100> been<00:02:40.220> your<00:02:40.400> head<00:02:40.490> down<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
straight if you've been your head down a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.750 
straight if you've been your head down a
bit<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.110> wind<00:02:42.290> goes<00:02:42.500> over<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.250> helmet

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
bit then the wind goes over your helmet

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.280 
bit then the wind goes over your helmet
instead<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.270> hits<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.840> slows<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.260> down

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
instead of hits it and slows you down

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.980 
instead of hits it and slows you down
okay<00:02:45.950> see<00:02:46.190> more<00:02:46.340> aerodynamic<00:02:47.120> yeah<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.870> you're

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990
