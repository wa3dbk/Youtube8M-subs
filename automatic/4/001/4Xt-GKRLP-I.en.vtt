00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
non-risk so if they do go like down the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
non-risk so if they do go like down the
price<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.689> discard<00:02:04.079> infomercial

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

200<00:03:01.080> k<00:03:01.230> 3<00:03:01.620> inch<00:03:01.740> k<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.460> could<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> pretty<00:03:03.150> good

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
200 k 3 inch k it could be a pretty good

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.970 
200 k 3 inch k it could be a pretty good
players<00:03:03.570> investing<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.800> definitely

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
players investing and I can definitely

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.550 
players investing and I can definitely
see<00:03:05.250> him<00:03:05.370> go<00:03:05.520> for<00:03:05.700> about<00:03:05.820> over<00:03:06.270> 100k<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.530> I

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
see him go for about over 100k so I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.960 
see him go for about over 100k so I
think<00:03:07.650> nasty<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.340> did<00:03:08.520> good<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.850> them

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
think nasty and you did good for them

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.220 
think nasty and you did good for them
out<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.630> definitely<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:10.200> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
out so I can definitely see that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
out so I can definitely see that
happening<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.250> let's<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.580> over<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> team

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
happening so let's go over to the team

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180 
happening so let's go over to the team
the<00:03:12.270> week<00:03:12.450> let<00:03:12.750> me<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:12.930> cancel<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.800> few

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
the week let me just cancel out a few

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.590 
the week let me just cancel out a few
players<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.730> think<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> definitely<00:03:15.300> should

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
players so I think you definitely should

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.020 
players so I think you definitely should
not<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.070> let's<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.430> over<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:17.820> there

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
not go for so let's go over here there

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.000 
not go for so let's go over here there
are<00:03:18.150> quite<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.510> few<00:03:18.600> expensive<00:03:19.200> players<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
are quite a few expensive players so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.370 
are quite a few expensive players so
Skylar<00:03:20.310> goes<00:03:20.580> for<00:03:20.760> over<00:03:21.000> 100<00:03:21.630> k<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.350> this

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
Skylar goes for over 100 k so this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.310 
Skylar goes for over 100 k so this
mertens<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.730> pay<00:03:23.940> goes<00:03:24.180> about<00:03:24.450> 100k<00:03:25.020> as<00:03:25.140> well

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
mertens the pay goes about 100k as well

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.380 
mertens the pay goes about 100k as well
I<00:03:25.470> would<00:03:25.739> really<00:03:26.040> recommend<00:03:26.250> these<00:03:26.730> three<00:03:27.209> I

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
I would really recommend these three I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.390 
I would really recommend these three I
think<00:03:27.690> they're<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:27.959> expensive<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.890> a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
think they're too expensive and a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.340 
think they're too expensive and a
boomerang<00:03:29.730> goes<00:03:29.970> about<00:03:30.300> one<00:03:30.600> MIT<00:03:30.810> 1<00:03:31.080> million

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
boomerang goes about one MIT 1 million

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.310 
boomerang goes about one MIT 1 million
coins<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.370> that's<00:03:32.670> definitely<00:03:32.970> no<00:03:33.570> do<00:03:33.840> not<00:03:34.080> go

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
coins so that's definitely no do not go

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.320 
coins so that's definitely no do not go
for<00:03:34.620> our<00:03:35.070> buddy<00:03:35.370> Hank<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.239> he

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
for our buddy Hank I don't think he

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.420 
for our buddy Hank I don't think he
would<00:03:36.420> go<00:03:36.570> too<00:03:36.630> good<00:03:37.050> for<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.560> mean<00:03:38.010> these

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
would go too good for you I mean these

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.100 
would go too good for you I mean these
could<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.880> good<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.480> don't<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:39.989> think

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
could be good but I don't really think

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.870 
could be good but I don't really think
they'll<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.560> as<00:03:40.739> good<00:03:41.010> as<00:03:41.070> Bruce<00:03:41.370> gets<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
they'll be as good as Bruce gets and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.880 
they'll be as good as Bruce gets and
murata<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:42.810> recommendations<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:43.739> this

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
murata so my recommendations for this

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.979 
murata so my recommendations for this
