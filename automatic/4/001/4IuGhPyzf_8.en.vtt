00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 walter kielholz thursday 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.089
 of course that the half-breeds is here to warm up 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.089
 c not finished but good 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 during the phases 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 take advantage of their numerical superiority are at 15 against 14 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.150
 and then she comes 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.060
 that's how much not surprised 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 boxes framed on the value of what the team captain 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.480
 the soil support was faster 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.170
 but from this sideline they are six minutes to 14 h 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 in charge of a hiding place 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.930
 for agenais who are unfounded 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 the second best defense May 7 on the scoreboard 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.830
 like what's more for beziers 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.110
 gold to see the game at the foot 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.090
 not too much solution think that the defense agenaise is still very 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.310
 very present 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 since that time, however, she could let rest against dsk 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.360
 among the six men 62 3 players and here we argue is that often this 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.530
 incoming 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.270
 the motorists of the soil 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.179
 the data warehousing module returned is training 15 against 15 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.240
 larger model 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.229
 but in four occasions to mark the minutes minutes of the fed were launched 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.450
 font midi at 5 meters 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 from the in-goal agenais ucaa 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 crossroads operates a little difficult 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.639
 the month of September 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.639
 that's why one is actually a kid who's going 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 but that makes 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 banish play 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.409
 situation that can also aim ahead of fairness king 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.080
 with regret that half of the deaths 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.080
 this remark 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.619
 first try of the season so much this player come 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.619
 the Olympic castres 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.859
 like what statistics is fine but here it is particularly 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.849
 to resist the thrust in the maule 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.749
 but the agenais could not resist they plated like red devils 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:10.779
 at the very end 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.839
 of the match but 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.879
 on the bulletin board are the Biterrois 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.040
 so they're not be silly 4'18 to afp amor the transformation of these 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.040
 plants current charges 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.419
 in this same channel 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:39.950
 you have to notice
