00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.100
 ll the second part the owner 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.470
 I want to continue 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.470
 and I do not 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.239
 in arriving some cadets since they sprouted 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.810
 until this year 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.009
 that the corner 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.400
 list of unpaid questions because 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.109
 apart 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.899
 shortly after in any 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.879
 of these places 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.190
 but with more staff 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.270
 asia some of these the two sides 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.280
 and for example 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.070
 she is ready 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.380
 has the same color to the VAT 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.280
 what does this face 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.810
 if you want to know 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.970
 these colors 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.570
 then what we do 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 it's just to turn the corner 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.580
 that we do this 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.620
 month to month you can not miss it 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.390
 will offer this Saturday night 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.120
 finished sixth 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.370
 Illescas 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.550
 then nothing knows him 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.650
 you have to know how to do it from any angle, for example here lionel messi 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.990
 Reserve 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.610
 in poetry centuries 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 tim k 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 stefanski we need 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.330
 oo who was another case 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 who are together 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
 but this one is different 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 when you want me to read essential 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.440
 that day 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.270
 who all 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.970
 here it is important that the ski this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.550
 risk 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.620
 continue sixth 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 we separate the pieces 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 and is that the cacique 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.270
 well I never knew 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.080
 street teaches us but it's very easy 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.580
 when it is still 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.800
 separated 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.999
 but corner has the white would be 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.089
 if we use that 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.969
 color has the view opposite 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.209
 recognize that color 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.659
 boat is inaccurate from the Holy See other side 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.689
 we present here 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.169
 we came back 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.169
 the part the cross read stolen 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.749
 it's the end 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
 puel so is this fall 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:46.559
 I paid it 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.559
 Valbuena that we all support who mirrors 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 It is important that the channels 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.269
 in this case I wanted to white the right 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.219
 we can not 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.479
 who break the right 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.679
 adriÃ¡n who missed three years ago other then 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.619
 takeoff 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.179
 and alone 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:14.629
 we improve 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.009
 it has fallen 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.289
 emerge 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.609
 let's follow two months never up to leave this one 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:26.919
 polanski was elusive 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.729
 ready spent everything 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.229
 in his decision 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.229
 it was with and without corners 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.029
 i 1 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.009
 a center 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.009
 and is that in many cases picnic 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.219
 addicts 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.359
 two 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.869
 it's almost the same 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.639
 the first 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.729
 the first method that is my paper and if they the previous 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:13.609
 nothing else 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.239
 quito - excesses and 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.789
 what is that together 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.079
 but back they have never given 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.559
 with this 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.559
 takeoff and take out cristina 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.059
 for a corner 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.229
 move away from state 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.090
 populate 11 to untie corner 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.090
 Mendez and Diaz again at home will be another 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.870
 and ready 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.009
 I think that they are all cases of fact of being 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.569
 i 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.729
 A) Yes 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.360
 koellerer 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.909
 seven patents are nowhere
