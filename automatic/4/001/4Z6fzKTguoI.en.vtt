00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello my life, that you are beautiful 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 Join szabo and today there is one 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.299
 Review of the trilogy of Jenny Hahn 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 and ceo of william this eye-to-eye 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.910
 guilty it is you have wished 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 and here it is ecology, as I said 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.150
 the first part is eye to eye 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.269
 the second volume is fire and flame and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.790
 the third volume is ash to ash and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.739
 I think cover first really nice 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.719
 and I'm totally beautiful that's just it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.450
 are pastel colors and whose 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.250
 favorite color is pink lavender one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 post office and yes I'll say that for a moment 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.449
 Before it to eye for eye lay with me forever 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.980
 It was really eternal around the beginning 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.449
 on parts of the course is good now 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 but belongs I've never hand 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.460
 Taken because I always thought that is 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 the typical youth psychology it becomes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.680
 to be too young for me that I'm too old 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 I 'm too boring for that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.950
 and then it has to stop someday 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.200
 taken in hand and I have these 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 series succession sought by such 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.630
 otherwise i have a book in one day 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 read 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 I liked it so much, I say too 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.159
 beforehand the series of me five stars 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 to get 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 but yes, what is it all about? 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 as you can see on the volumes 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.770
 always three girls on the three 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.530
 Girls are also and that would be 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 mary kate and william and the three 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.479
 come together they know they want 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.600
 avenge they all want to join 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 someone calculator and so find theirs 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 walk together they decide together 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.939
 to the respective people 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.820
 expect them to live the hard 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.140
 they did not like or 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.540
 whatever and julia and cat who were 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.189
 I've been pretty good friends with that before 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.189
 not 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.260
 gives a boy a girl a hot one 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.720
 by similarly ran and rain or any die 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.540
 insanely expensive clique and someday 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.910
 They did away with cat and kat and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.640
 elia were then if not even him 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.310
 befriended and the girls probably all 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.880
 on an island so pretty much everything 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 small pretty tight everyone knows everyone 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.460
 Mary from the little one has outside 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.990
 but the island comes back and 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.700
 there is a boy who has that easy 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.920
 life made it hard he has it 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.640
 bullied and she just wants to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.230
 so he avenge the book or the books 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.610
 which we really voted very exciting 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.750
 especially the last part 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.560
 I do not want to be accurate now 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.780
 continue to enter the content 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.330
 but it is very creepy and it is 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.020
 goes also from the evil into the fantasy quite 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.610
 slightly the window direction rhine 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.250
 it is not everything as it seems 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.100
 not everyone is what he claims to be 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.850
 his or not everyone knows who he is 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.220
 and that was so exciting it was 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.830
 really so exciting I just sat or 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.850
 so well known and what can i read 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.670
 not with me 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.160
 davis i am i love that i am man 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.140
 a world and it is very well done 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.380
 So the chapters are structured that way 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.269
 it is always before who is talking 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.900
 So next is a linear one 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.019
 then then it has to be a bit off 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.180
 made very cool and i can give you the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.010
 no matter whether or not 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.230
 are young or a little older 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.690
 but yes that's a great trip 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.340
 in between or almost be back 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.160
 in the row what you can not get out of hand 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.260
 can lay and I said bring it 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.670
 Please read all three volumes because 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
 you will freak if you have the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.459
 first and second read and also 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.170
 do not have the true fin band 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.550
 also, just want to know 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.670
 how it goes on are not 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.989
 necessarily mega cash cliffhanger at the end 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.970
 but i want to know how it works 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.560
 go on how's it going from what happens 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.609
 and 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.650
 oh god so you feel right with it like that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.359
 but also the loving being becomes 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.580
 is a full in it if I too mine 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.130
 God 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.139
 and yes, it's really cool 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.440
 easily remembers a panel 1 where 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.700
 But it would not compare yes 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.440
 a bit confused i should mine 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.600
 take notes before I do it but 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 yes and that is the turn and I can 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.380
 put the start and look at me 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.139
 comments if you are already read 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.270
 have as you liked it and yes 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.389
 You can still find a comprehensive review 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.340
 on the block beuys and box.de and 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.610
 thank you for the next time 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.610
