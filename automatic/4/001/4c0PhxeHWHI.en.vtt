the plate size you're running that makes
it<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.010> lot<00:01:16.130> easier<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:17.030> understand<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.930> you

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
it a lot easier to understand it you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.410 
it a lot easier to understand it you
drag<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.799> job<00:01:19.130> down<00:01:19.430> onto<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.939> plate<00:01:20.180> maker

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
drag that job down onto the plate maker
