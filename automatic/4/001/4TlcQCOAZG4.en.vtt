00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello youtube friends tell you that 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.709
 extra that you are welcome to a new 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.510
 hello the master collection video 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.860
 custom quotes true in this 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.630
 chance we will find a new 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.700
 district for the hello 3 campaign 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.650
 only that we are already in the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.599
 last mission that is the mission 'leave it and 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.189
 they are actually telex doses that 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.449
 they are in this mission but good nothing else 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.220
 I'm going to show you the first one 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.110
 find just starting the mission and 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.910
 along this path, some will already know 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 that is a skull that is the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.170
 skull of is the mythical skull and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.970
 Well, nothing else as I have already 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.769
 been showing if I find myself like this if 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.570
 I get on the road with a skull 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.920
 a terminal because I will show them and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.660
 this time we'll just 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.489
 find with a terminal precisely 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.989
 right in this part before continuing with 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.940
 the mission normally we would have to 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.920
 follow everything right let's find us 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.360
 this area that is where then later 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.010
 We will be there where they will be 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.230
 many pilots and then we're going to 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.180
 find a structure is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 four runner and all that thing and cut 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.940
 It will tell us what it is going to say 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.160
 where are we going and what are you doing 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.720
 more than eighty Boris del loco that good 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.729
 Well, if you tell them that, they are on the right track 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.380
 you will find on your left the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.000
 terminal of this mission and well as 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.679
 that like the skulls are also 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.930
 scattered by all the missions like this 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.060
 that I doubt very much that I can bring you 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.820
 either of the skulls and the terminals 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.410
 since I have other plans but not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.930
 They are so hard to get too 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.340
 There are several guides through other channels 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.080
 youtube that steal videos from us 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 then at the moment of finding it 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.500
 I suppose they are going to give them both achievements 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.000
 that the first one would be that does find 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.830
 a terminal in gel or three if that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.840
 previously you have not done it and also 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.040
 that you found the terminal in 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.990
 the mission of hey what is the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.250
 conditioning I gave myself and good not 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.900
 I want to roll up so much in the story 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.970
 hello since things are put 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.260
 complex and just behind you back 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.300
 from the terminal or if they entered 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.920
 directly would be to the right are they going to 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.570
 find with this obsolete path that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.759
 there is nothing and what they are going to do is 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.830
 jump grenade in case you are alone 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.899
 but I warn you that this jump is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.640
 really very difficult to me they cost me 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.470
 many attempts and the worst is that you do not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.180
 They give finished control until you pass 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.500
 because the part where you find 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.660
 the flows then it will be very 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.890
 complicated that the first one comes out and you go 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.600
 to have to be trying and I 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.940
 I took 20 minutes good in case 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 it is only advisable that you are 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 with a friend but then, as I am a 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.410
 forever alone well, I'm good 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.360
 doing alone and they are teaching them 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.860
 do it alone and once you get here 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.660
 Well you are going to find this jump 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.560
 that in fact if they saw this catanas of 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.900
 connector I feel that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.060
 or force to make this jump grenade 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.860
 but good in this last jump to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 move to the next platform they go to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.160
 have the same to have good luck to me 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
 it came to me first luckily but 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.810
 Well, once they are jumping 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.450
 meet one of the creators of 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.120
 bonn and just with a bath towel 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.489
 coming out to bathe me I know I do not know what 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.410
 because they put this thing the others were 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 some waffles let me tell you and good 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.680
 Well, when you find it 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 interact with him they will find 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.450
 with the achievement of on the way to your destination 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.220
 something like that and then a total reference to 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.690
 distinguish how they can know and good 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 that has been the distract a bit 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.810
 complicated is one of the most difficult 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.910
 to get but I bet you're going to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.519
 like it a lot so that's all been 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.739
 you liked it like comment and subscribe 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.739
 which track says goodbye
