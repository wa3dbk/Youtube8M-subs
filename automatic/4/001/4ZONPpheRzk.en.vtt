00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
of it off the top of my head but it's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400 
of it off the top of my head but it's
not<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> suit<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.750> new<00:02:16.960> one<00:02:17.230> that's

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
not like the suit the new one that's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.530 
not like the suit the new one that's
like<00:02:17.590> super<00:02:17.860> portable<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.360> don't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
like super portable because I don't

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.910

really<00:02:19.569> plan<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:19.960> going<00:02:20.380> around<00:02:20.560> with<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.800> too

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
really plan on going around with it too

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.670 
really plan on going around with it too
much<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:22.000> all<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.500> still

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
much but that is all right it is still

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.809 
much but that is all right it is still
very<00:02:23.880> easy<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.240> use<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:26.110> there's<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:26.819> and

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
very easy to use so there's that one and

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.510 
very easy to use so there's that one and
that<00:02:27.850> will<00:02:28.420> allow<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.900> record<00:02:29.520> gameplay

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that will allow me to record gameplay

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.780 
that will allow me to record gameplay

5 all for the PlayStation 4 so I'm gonna
be<00:03:28.310> playing<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.670> lot<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.880> those<00:03:28.970> games<00:03:29.240> I'm

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
be playing a lot of those games I'm

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.150 
be playing a lot of those games I'm
actually<00:03:29.900> showing<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.350> Destiny's<00:03:30.860> footage

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
actually showing you Destiny's footage

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.400 
actually showing you Destiny's footage
just<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.060> I'd<00:03:32.540> seem<00:03:32.840> like<00:03:32.990> a<00:03:33.020> cool<00:03:33.260> way<00:03:33.380> to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
just because I'd seem like a cool way to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.760 
just because I'd seem like a cool way to
start<00:03:33.800> off<00:03:33.890> because<00:03:34.660> it's<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.930> console<00:03:36.590> only

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
start off because it's a console only

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.170 
start off because it's a console only
game<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.310> therefore<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.700> would<00:03:37.820> show<00:03:38.000> that

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
game and therefore it would show that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.450 
game and therefore it would show that
I'm<00:03:38.300> playing<00:03:38.570> on<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.380> console<00:03:39.890> but<00:03:40.100> actually<00:03:40.400> I

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
I'm playing on a console but actually I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.650 
I'm playing on a console but actually I
don't<00:03:40.670> plan<00:03:40.820> on<00:03:40.940> playing<00:03:41.150> too<00:03:41.360> much<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
don't plan on playing too much of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.000 
don't plan on playing too much of
Destiny<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.080> played<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> lot<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.740> that<00:03:42.830> on<00:03:42.860> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
