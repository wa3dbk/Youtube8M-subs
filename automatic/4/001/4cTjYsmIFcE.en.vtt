00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.090
 hello friends in today's video I love you 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.090
 teach how to make these originals 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.580
 bracelets with the colors of the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.419
 selections of the eurocopa in this case 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.369
 Spain and Italy but you can make them 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.050
 the colors that you like most or of the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.420
 selection that you want to encourage 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.420
 let's see what materials we need 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.780
 we're going to need about 20 centimeters of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 licorice leather cord in the color that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410
 more you like 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.219
 we will also need cotton thread 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 waxed 1 mm thick in 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.840
 the colors that we want to use 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.620
 2 between pieces and a leather clasp 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.620
 licorice 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 and our glue for jewelery then 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 let's see how to make the bracelet 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.710
 I have here already cut the leather 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.930
 licorice tailor that serves me for the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.090
 size of the doll first thing we go 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.630
 to do is place one of the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 pieces in the leather and at the same time we are going to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.920
 introduce the colors the colors of the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 cotton yarn in the sierra in this 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.370
 case let's make the flag of spain 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.760
 serves us in red and yellow 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.960
 the mind is already for us between the pieces and 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.960
 now all for the leather 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.969
 calculating more or less where we want 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.969
 let the flag be 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.110
 now what we can do is also 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.409
 give a little bit of glue here in the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.860
 back to fix the cotton and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.860
 the crotch 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.010
 we remove a little bit we go to the glue 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.020
 and we put everything we hope a little bit 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.180
 of that sector and let's start 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.180
 to put the colors in their place 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.800
 to make the flag of spain we are going to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.610
 start spinning the color thread 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.780
 Red 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.750
 we hold there 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.050
 and we start the yellow we leave it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.440
 back hidden and we go around the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440
 Red 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.800
 we will do as many laps as we like 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.880
 until we get the length we want 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.880
 for the first color 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 we are trying to get it right 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 together all the laps 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.550
 well I think so 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.680
 it would be enough for the first color 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.810
 red flag 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.969
 and now what we would do is do what 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.819
 same with the color yellow the red what 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:30.069
 we would leave hidden behind we would go 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.069
 throwing the yellow 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.240
 and we would have the yellow and we will return 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.750
 finish with the red circling the 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.750
 Red 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.760
 from behind you can see how it looks 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.610
 but ahead 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.890
 the color changes are not noticed and we 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.890
 the flag is going very well 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.150
 we take the same turns as before 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.190
 red color there we would have already made the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.190
 flag and now as at the beginning 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.930
 we just have to put the other 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.609
 / piece 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.259
 by silos cotton 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.259
 and for the leather regale 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.650
 and we would give a little bit of glue here in 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.969
 the back we removed a little 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.589
 the edges 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.589
 let's apply the glue here 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.820
 and we put the between pieces 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.190
 as we hope to do before 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.729
 we cut these ends of the threads and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.710
 we would only have to put the closure 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.080
 and in jazz we have accepted the glue 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.080
 I'm going to cut the ends of the thread 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.880
 there we would have the bracelet already made and 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.610
 As I said, we would only have to place 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.150
 the closure we're going now glue on the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 leather 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.390
 and in the crotch 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.160
 the same on the other end with the other 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 part of the closure 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:37.439
 and there we would have the bracelet ready 

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:40.419
 Once everything is dry, we could 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.789
 use it to encourage our 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.860
 selection in this case as you see I've 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.719
 made with the colors of Spain but 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.309
 you can do it here you see with the colors 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.739
 of italy with the colors of the 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:52.389
 selection to which you want to animate well 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:55.179
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.369
 encourage you to do it and we see each other very 

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:59.369
 soon in the next video chao 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.940
 two
