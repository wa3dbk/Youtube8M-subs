00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.610 
and then drag in it's kind of hard to
describe<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.660> can<00:03:17.810> basically<00:03:17.989> see<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.560> in

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
describe but you can basically see it in

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.280 
describe but you can basically see it in
the<00:03:18.709> video<00:03:19.120> it's<00:03:20.120> just<00:03:20.660> drawing<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.049> little

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the video it's just drawing a little

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.809 
the video it's just drawing a little
triangle<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.829> corner<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.220> your<00:03:22.310> eye<00:03:22.370> and

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
triangle in the corner of your eye and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.240 
triangle in the corner of your eye and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
then drawing that in you gotta also

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.979 
then drawing that in you gotta also
connect<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.790> top<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.329> bottom<00:03:26.450> because

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
connect the top in the bottom because

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.660 
connect the top in the bottom because
sometimes<00:03:27.380> they<00:03:27.680> don't<00:03:27.950> connect<00:03:28.280> quite<00:03:28.489> right

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
sometimes they don't connect quite right
