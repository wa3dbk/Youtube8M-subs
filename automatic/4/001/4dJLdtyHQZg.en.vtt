00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.699
 hello we did not even think good of johnny a new creation 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.740
 of the module 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.610
 of the only form he seizes from derain vlaminck of jean-christophe Bouvier who 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.679
 authorized 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.819
 and yesterday 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.200
 his employer what I know is that lately since he was 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 achieved 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 because not adopting sales on the site of suspects 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470
 so nothing of a rally simulation 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 as we have already discovered in the last year 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.440
 in t4 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 and the psychologist dupuy-de-lÃ´me tel initiated a petition 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.620
 and an excellent bill since have done ii 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.080
 not easy today's solid credit 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.210
 of this culture 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 just like midam material from the game worlds 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.150
 the video it aims to introduce you to the prison module 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.910
 the modules in the foreground 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.470
 allows you to discover three first steps 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.850
 negotiations 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.509
 as we put on line the different products that we can 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.659
 already discover 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660
 this will have the same point fr 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.920
 but also the best contributions 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 so for them 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 go there create your own ravine 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.880
 submit us new role 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.070
 ydd 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 one they are 30 for sure according to this person on the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.280
 apogee online 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.690
 we are not plays so be careful 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.540
 claim them 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.830
 the show the dead and from her lawyer she fought her 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.660
 critics 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.720
 the director in this system to do it 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.980
 or on the tric trac site 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.050
 of course we better understand the back than the hat 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 if you do not know the rules you would have discovered 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.110
 these are people very strongly o'hare just they watched this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.020
 video 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.490
 g little out of duty 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 it's secret of my life 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.880
 since 2008 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 this model works the rules of the game 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.289
 let's go back the module and percent to 6 points 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 while that presents the world 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.630
 other little demo we are going to die 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.039
 created by tim kaine 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.509
 so as indicated 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:29.779
 my three steps 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.749
 we the undersigned 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.059
 we also have 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 the possible it is necessary to say that players we wish 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.159
 the player of the frame 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.359
 I am blond 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.409
 we were gone 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.789
 simoncelli 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.039
 times files the tray 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.809
 so he wants the screen 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.939
 yes that choose the zoom level but also adjust directly 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.939
 the tray 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.760
 we even look at the menu the focused audition this tuesday 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.069
 he mentions compound of a second container 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.249
 if the little ones are play males 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.249
 the ability to indicate flavian damage right click 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.319
 he has a triplet of torres directly on a map 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.969
 but gases but third countries 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.669
 these locations to file a complaint 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.899
 cards 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:29.819
 musically 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.989
 he indicated having taken in a saucer 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.129
 also an all right i was changing m 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.230
 saint-tite the more you get paid, which is enough for me 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.549
 for the mayor 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.639
 the other hands of the players are visible by account 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.639
 then on the set 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.569
 what are we going to find them 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.499
 the snpm 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.639
 he avoided 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.439
 more but boxes 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.959
 here I am 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.959
 without recommending this little bit of 6000 everyone follows 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.149
 to launch here on a right click 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.969
 where you go accessible to the whole 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.539
 fonctionnalities 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.590
 for a possible on cd the ranger is the put 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.009
 in this novel 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.059
 you can also feet that will ensure that assured 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:27.439
 that's going to install a small mark directly on the prices 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.590
 As a reminder 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.590
 it went well 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 you can obviously not tickle several 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.559
 insured d 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.260
 subtle china several dice 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.289
 who is mexico 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.550
 then if want to launched the idea 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.340
 what draws all the zones 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.639
 a left click 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.259
 and then do the teaching and that's because just a little bit more 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.150
 you want 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.930
 for the fastest 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.889
 removed the whole 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.889
 markers just click on that little bit 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.879
 the centenarians 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.099
 manson to be clear about the tastes 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.659
 I told myself everything 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.739
 and speaker five pages everyone owen 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.740
 she wants to find the little cards 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.330
 almost stable cards 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.139
 corresponding 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.990
 to the rope it is necessary to quickly 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.240
 it's not enough sense 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.080
 drag &amp; drop 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.559
 laid the cards 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.050
 in the tabloid of the nahb the map 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.919
 strings this one can automatically stopped 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.919
 on the other hand in the case in the case what its members 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.349
 of earth time ps 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.490
 it remains facing close to towers 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.819
 automatically if you have encountered a problem 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:50.900
 clear 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.509
 om has also launched the figures of saint-paul triangle 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.509
 which are a right click on it to return it automatically 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.909
 which takes place he died mismo at the end of 2003 it flies away 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.650
 but be careful only happen 3% 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.159
 strait 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:13.339
 cards 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.010
 tests with cards 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.080
 you will find the microphones and cameras a small car 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.239
 but I had to iron under the supports -11% and especially the enemies 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:28.289
 of course there is one that's okay it's still more fun to see the 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.639
 car in the good sense it's quite possible but simply 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.590
 of pity 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.680
 rotations 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 I voted in relation to the display 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.159
 barack obama I think at any moment in fact the round 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.249
 so remains 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:50.259
 the title could initiate and who you 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.249
 gorged m 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:52.080
 from everyone 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.430
 Courroye 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.099
 it's up to him to set the tone for the cards 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.919
 in the Sahel countries in the initial pack 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.039
 we are very directly 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.330
 a part if you wish 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.699
 Well, I hope that you have summarized this text well 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.649
 and whether or not it is neither the crisis 

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.469
 bring the lunar module 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.469
 we are found that's what they told us for inhibitions 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.899
 and obviously for creating 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.919
 your creations 2 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.009
 two parts must him 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.080
 so that we wanted to wear everyone and that simply share 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.219
 the site
