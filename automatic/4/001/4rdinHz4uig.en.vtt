00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.200 

so<00:00:25.070> when<00:00:25.220> we<00:00:25.340> did<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.580> interior<00:00:25.760> for<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.090> new

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
so when we did the interior for the new

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.370 
so when we did the interior for the new
Chrysler<00:00:26.570> 200<00:00:27.160> we<00:00:28.160> really<00:00:28.930> dug<00:00:29.930> deep<00:00:30.200> we

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
Chrysler 200 we really dug deep we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.230 
Chrysler 200 we really dug deep we
really<00:00:30.650> try<00:00:31.010> to<00:00:31.070> understand<00:00:31.520> okay<00:00:31.760> how<00:00:31.910> can<00:00:31.970> we

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
really try to understand okay how can we

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.450 
really try to understand okay how can we
help<00:00:32.390> elevate<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:33.260> brand<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:33.980> we<00:00:34.190> look<00:00:34.340> for

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
help elevate the brand so we look for

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.280 
help elevate the brand so we look for
inspiration<00:00:34.640> right<00:00:35.150> here<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.600> there's

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
inspiration right here and there's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.960 
inspiration right here and there's
beautiful<00:00:36.590> examples<00:00:37.370> whether<00:00:37.760> it's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
beautiful examples whether it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.330 
beautiful examples whether it's
architecture<00:00:38.750> whether<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:39.340> furniture

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
architecture whether it's furniture

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.790 
architecture whether it's furniture
whether<00:00:40.700> it's<00:00:40.940> landscapes<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.170> provided<00:00:42.710> us

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
whether it's landscapes that provided us

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.410 
whether it's landscapes that provided us
plenty<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.280> inspiration<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.059> went<00:00:44.270> directly

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
plenty of inspiration that went directly

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.450 
plenty of inspiration that went directly
into<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.110> interior<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.680> vehicle<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.309> so

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
into the interior of this vehicle and so

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.010 
into the interior of this vehicle and so
one<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.120> great<00:00:47.360> features<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:47.809> we

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
one of the the great features that we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.020 
one of the the great features that we
put<00:00:48.170> into<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:48.470> interior<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.520> 9<00:00:49.700> speed

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
put into this interior is the 9 speed

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570 
put into this interior is the 9 speed
transmission<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.100> resulting<00:00:52.100> out<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:52.430> we

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
transmission and resulting out of it we

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.850 
transmission and resulting out of it we
put<00:00:52.910> in<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.120> rotary<00:00:53.420> e-shift<00:00:53.750> ER<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.830> e

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
put in a rotary e-shift ER with the e

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.160 
put in a rotary e-shift ER with the e
shifter<00:00:55.460> it's<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.940> very<00:00:56.150> compact<00:00:56.780> package

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
shifter it's a very compact package

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.590 
shifter it's a very compact package
feels<00:00:57.650> great<00:00:57.950> when<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.220> operate<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.390> now

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
feels great when you operate it but now

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.050 
feels great when you operate it but now
it<00:00:59.810> allows<00:01:00.050> us<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.530> almost<00:01:00.740> create<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.370> floating

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
it allows us to almost create a floating

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.240 
it allows us to almost create a floating
console<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:02.840> an<00:01:02.930> angled<00:01:03.350> floating<00:01:03.770> console

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
console it's an angled floating console

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.999 
console it's an angled floating console
also<00:01:05.000> accompanied<00:01:05.810> with<00:01:05.840> an<00:01:06.200> electronic<00:01:06.680> park

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
also accompanied with an electronic park

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.790 
also accompanied with an electronic park
brake<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.670> takes<00:01:08.390> out<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> need<00:01:08.990> for<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.380> big

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
brake so it takes out the need for a big

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.070 
brake so it takes out the need for a big
manual<00:01:10.400> park<00:01:10.759> brake<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.540> combination<00:01:12.050> of

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
manual park brake so the combination of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.990 
manual park brake so the combination of
those<00:01:12.200> two<00:01:12.410> components<00:01:12.560> free<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.640> all<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
those two components free up all the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.480 
those two components free up all the
space<00:01:14.150> underneath<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.200> allow<00:01:16.160> us<00:01:16.340> to

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
space underneath it and allow us to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.760 
space underneath it and allow us to
create<00:01:16.790> tremendous<00:01:17.720> amount<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.080> storage<00:01:18.410> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
create tremendous amount of storage and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.430 
create tremendous amount of storage and
we<00:01:19.640> didn't<00:01:19.880> stop<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.450> actually<00:01:20.600> went

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
we didn't stop there we actually went

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.639 
we didn't stop there we actually went
further<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.180> made<00:01:23.180> sliding<00:01:24.110> cup<00:01:24.290> holders

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
further and made sliding cup holders

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.280 
further and made sliding cup holders
standard<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:26.630> can<00:01:26.810> tell<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.140> those
