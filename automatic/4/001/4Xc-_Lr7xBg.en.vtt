00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.660
 Mr. Skewley 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.810
 I am taking a bubble bath 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.910
 Oh 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.079
 I really relax 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.289
 Mr. Skawarie 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.389
 How many colors can be seen in soap bubbles 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.279
 Have you ever wondered 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.519
 Do you want to know why 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.519
 Of course I want to know 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.009
 Soap bubble is thin film 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.350
 But the thickness depends on the surface 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.380
 The light is composed of red, green and blue light waves 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.130
 The amount of each color reflected to the surface is different 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.190
 Let's find the translation 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.900
 Light is a wave 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.030
 Different color lightwaves will have different wavelengths 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.440
 When a light wave hits the surface of the transparent film, part of it is reflected to the upper surface 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.840
 Another part is reflected on the bottom surface 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.390
 Others pass through 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.980
 This is how blue light waves are reflected on the surface of soap bubbles 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.610
 Represents 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.870
 As you can see 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.370
 Some of the waves are reflected above 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.500
 Some are reflected down 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 Others are passing through 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760
 In this part 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.190
 The thickness of the soap bubble is in harmony with the wavelength 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.850
 The waves reflected on the upper and lower surfaces of the soap bubbles are perfectly aligned 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.510
 I am sending a very strong blue signal into the air 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.030
 Now the red light wave is hitting the same part of the soap bubble 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.910
 Let's try 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.060
 As the red light wave is long, the parts reflected on the upper and lower surfaces do not line up 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.289
 Red light waves cancel each other 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.820
 Never make red reflexes strong 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.640
 However 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.900
 If soap bubbles are thicker, red light waves will also line up 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.150
 And the blue light waves cancel each other 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.930
 Show soap bubbles in red 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.380
 How much light do we have in the entire color spectrum 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.300
 I can draw or reflect 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.660
 This soap bubble is a lot of blue Some green 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.099
 It looks greenish because it contains red 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.109
 Soap bubbles because we know the length of light waves 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.389
 I can see the color and read the thickness 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.749
 I did not think that bathing time would be studied so much! 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.590
 How is Mr. Skawaries. Thin film measurement is useful 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.840
 It is clean and interesting
