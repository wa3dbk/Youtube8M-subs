00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169 

I<00:00:01.399> think<00:00:02.399> I'm<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> try<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.790> make<00:00:03.000> me<00:00:03.149> a

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I think I'm going to try to make me a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.749 
I think I'm going to try to make me a
homemade<00:00:03.570> bridge<00:00:04.069> because<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.279> head<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.549> a

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
homemade bridge because the head is a

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.430 
homemade bridge because the head is a
little<00:00:05.970> bit<00:00:06.359> softer<00:00:07.170> than<00:00:07.290> normal<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
little bit softer than normal on the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
little bit softer than normal on the
priority<00:00:10.440> mail<00:00:10.759> banjo<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.120> needs<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.420> kind<00:00:12.570> of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
priority mail banjo it needs a kind of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.079 
priority mail banjo it needs a kind of
an<00:00:12.780> extra<00:00:13.080> tall<00:00:13.290> bridge<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
an extra tall bridge and this is the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.670 
an extra tall bridge and this is the
tallest<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.440> little

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
tallest one I have and it's a little

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000 
tallest one I have and it's a little
shallow<00:00:17.270> for<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:19.170> put<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:19.500> shims<00:00:19.800> up

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
shallow for that I can put some shims up

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
shallow for that I can put some shims up
under<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.460> stop<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> string<00:00:21.330> buzz<00:00:21.570> but

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
under there and stop the string buzz but

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.230 
under there and stop the string buzz but
it's<00:00:21.930> also<00:00:22.279> messes<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> sound<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.090> what

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it's also messes up the sound so what

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.519 
it's also messes up the sound so what
I'm<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> draw<00:00:25.350> off

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I'm going to do is I'm going to draw off

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
I'm going to do is I'm going to draw off
a<00:00:25.560> kind<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.189> rough<00:00:26.400> pattern<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.390> except

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
a kind of a rough pattern on here except

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
a kind of a rough pattern on here except
make<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.800> good<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.640> taller<00:00:29.970> I'll<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
make it a good bit taller I'll make it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690 
make it a good bit taller I'll make it
little<00:00:30.720> extra<00:00:31.080> talk<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.859> drown<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
little extra talk as I can drown the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
little extra talk as I can drown the
feet<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.290> sander<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.340> there

feet down on the on the sander out there
and<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.480> ahead<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.750> cut<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.440> bridge

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and go ahead and cut me out of a bridge

and go ahead and cut me out of a bridge
or<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.520> saw<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> then

what<00:00:47.460> I'd<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.730> looking<00:00:47.850> bridge<00:00:48.210> right<00:00:48.480> there

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
what I'd be looking bridge right there

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.920 
what I'd be looking bridge right there
but<00:00:49.550> it'll<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.579> fun<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> works<00:00:51.480> what

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
mark my notches in here from my strings

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.080 
mark my notches in here from my strings
and<00:00:56.840> then<00:00:57.949> notch<00:00:58.949> am<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> coping<00:00:59.879> saw

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630 

okay<00:01:09.630> I've<00:01:09.720> got<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.020> bridge<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
okay I've got my bridge on there and it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.380 
okay I've got my bridge on there and it
actually<00:01:11.970> sounds<00:01:12.450> great<00:01:14.030> pretty<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.150> sound

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
actually sounds great pretty good sound

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.900 
actually sounds great pretty good sound
for<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.659> envelope<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:17.310> nice<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.549> clear

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.210 

but<00:01:23.910> it's<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.390> too<00:01:24.570> tall<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.680> what

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but it's a little bit too tall so what

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.110 
but it's a little bit too tall so what
I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.940> going<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.200 
I'm going to do is I'm going to
calculate<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:28.520> distance<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
calculate the distance that I want that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
calculate the distance that I want that
to<00:01:30.330> come<00:01:30.510> down<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> take<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to come down and I'm going to take it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.990 
to come down and I'm going to take it
and<00:01:31.980> stand<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.550> up<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:34.400> table<00:01:35.400> sander<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and stand it up on my table sander and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.180 
and stand it up on my table sander and
i'm<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:36.540> grind<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.190> just

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
i'm just going to grind it down just

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.100 
i'm just going to grind it down just
about<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.120> get<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.810> exactly

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
about if I get it just about exactly

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
about if I get it just about exactly
right<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.800> perfect<00:01:41.010> ordinance<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
right that would be perfect ordinance so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.130 
right that would be perfect ordinance so
that's<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.510> work<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.690> us<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's what I'm going to work for us to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.990 
that's what I'm going to work for us to
try<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:44.310> Oh<00:01:45.380> about<00:01:46.380> an<00:01:46.470> eight

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
try to take maybe Oh about an eight

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.130 
try to take maybe Oh about an eight
somewhere<00:01:48.000> between<00:01:48.120> two<00:01:48.270> sixteenth<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.870> H<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
somewhere between two sixteenth and H of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.290 
somewhere between two sixteenth and H of
an<00:01:49.260> 82<00:01:49.650> an<00:01:49.740> inch<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.400> we'll<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.210> how

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
an 82 an inch off of it we'll see how

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:41.300 
an 82 an inch off of it we'll see how
that<00:01:51.360> works

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.950 

Oh

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.120 

okay<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:52.990> think<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.350> homemade<00:02:53.620> bridge<00:02:53.860> worked

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
okay I think that homemade bridge worked

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.990 
okay I think that homemade bridge worked
out<00:02:54.310> pretty<00:02:54.430> well<00:02:54.610> it's<00:02:55.030> not<00:02:55.210> very<00:02:55.390> pretty<00:02:55.600> but

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
out pretty well it's not very pretty but
