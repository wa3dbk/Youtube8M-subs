00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
for this reason I've decided that all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.980 
for this reason I've decided that all
I'm<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.460> play<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> short<00:01:09.479> clip<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I'm going to do is play a short clip of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.500 
I'm going to do is play a short clip of
it<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> link<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> everyone

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it and then have a link so that everyone

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.420 
it and then have a link so that everyone
goes<00:01:12.750> straight<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.320> channel<00:01:13.799> rather

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
goes straight to your channel rather

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.160 
goes straight to your channel rather
than<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> watching<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.119> online<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> way

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
than just watching it online so that way

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
than just watching it online so that way
you<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.590> much<00:01:16.740> exposure<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.340> possible<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you get as much exposure as possible and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
you get as much exposure as possible and
you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> might<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.650> subscribers

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you know you might get some subscribers

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.940 
you know you might get some subscribers
but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> can't<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.170> guarantee<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but I can't really guarantee that the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
but I can't really guarantee that the
winners<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> number<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.570> views<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
winners will get a number of views or a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
winners will get a number of views or a
certain<00:01:25.350> number<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.650> subscribers<00:01:26.009> because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
certain number of subscribers because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
certain number of subscribers because
obviously<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.680> many<00:01:28.710> people

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
obviously I don't know how many people

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.289

are going to actually go through it
watch<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> fairly

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
watch it but because this is a fairly
