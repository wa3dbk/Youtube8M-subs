 for a while 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.410

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.579
 the evenings why not face the game will do 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.210
 ads on twitter and facebook 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.469
 and this video to a youtube advertiser I 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.420
 would say it's a story of touching 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:58.000
 many more many more people 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.549
 in for those who follow me like that 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.960
 we're a lot more crazy looking at that 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.960
 at ultra rare stuff now the m4 at 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.489
 4 on the mans just for you 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.340
 to say I'm going to stream is 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.760
 regularly go cs and maybe 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.890
 possibly in the future other games 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.980
 It can be interesting 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.150
 here is to relax on other games 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 you can find me on the channel 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.340
 switch so everything is in the description 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.359
 of course I make announcements on 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.290
 twitter and facebook 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.280
 and the ideal is really that we are 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.850
 maximum console possible 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.280
 why because what is 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.109
 interesting is that I have ten have a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.600
 little concept that I put up on 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.630
 my channel is that at the end of each 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.940
 evening we made a little war subscribers 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.820

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.199
 scared the leap and two passes on the on 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.239
 the switch and there everyone is 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.609
 connect and there we have fun together 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.609
 to simply play a counter 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.169
 offensive global strike and wick 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.639
 roles appeared good I'm just saying to 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.889
 manu the members of the spirit of 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 champions between us to get 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.139
 found in better conditions 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.199
 the most exciting fun 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.660
 possible so here is this little video 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.470
 to tell you that I'm going to stream and have 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.609
 three days that I'm shaking my pc is holding the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.790
 blow because it's very hot we are 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.600

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.490
 for me the stream the stream is game 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.870
 direct is the future is the focus of 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.450
 the interaction of a player from a 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.420
 personality with the viewers with the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.830
 subscribers with the people who follow us 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.900
