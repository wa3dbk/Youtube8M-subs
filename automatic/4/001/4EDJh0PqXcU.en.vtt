00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
design that I've been really comfortable

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.790 
design that I've been really comfortable
with<00:01:12.179> doing<00:01:12.360> lately<00:01:12.690> has<00:01:13.110> been<00:01:13.259> snakeskin

with doing lately has been snakeskin

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.980 
with doing lately has been snakeskin
design<00:01:14.160> and<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.880> figured<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
design and I figured it you know it's a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.480 
design and I figured it you know it's a
combination<00:01:16.229> between<00:01:16.530> using<00:01:17.100> glitters<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
combination between using glitters a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
combination between using glitters a
little<00:01:17.910> bit<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> marble<00:01:18.509> technique<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.350> little

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
little bit of marble technique a little

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
little bit of marble technique a little
bit<00:01:20.160> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> tooling<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:23.150> mixing<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.390> with

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
bit of the tooling and mixing that with

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
bit of the tooling and mixing that with
the<00:01:25.200> stiletto<00:01:25.590> shape<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.820> some

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the stiletto shape and you got some

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.020 
the stiletto shape and you got some
funky<00:01:27.479> donkey<00:01:27.630> nails<00:01:28.520> how<00:01:29.520> did<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> prepare

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
damage so if you understand proper

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.600 
damage so if you understand proper
pressure<00:01:50.689> you're<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.560> damage<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
pressure you're not going to damage the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
pressure you're not going to damage the

i apply my bonder basically proper form

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
i apply my bonder basically proper form
application<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:03.539> important<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
application is very important to the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.560 
application is very important to the
structure<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.920> stiletto<00:02:05.369> shade<00:02:05.670> you

structure of the stiletto shade you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.740 
structure of the stiletto shade you
can't<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> forums<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.890> parallel<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
can't put the forums on parallel to the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
can't put the forums on parallel to the
growth<00:02:10.049> channels<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.679> actually<00:02:11.100> have<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
growth channels they actually have to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.650 
growth channels they actually have to
tilt<00:02:12.739> slightly<00:02:13.739> downward<00:02:14.519> at<00:02:14.700> an<00:02:14.730> angle<00:02:15.329> so

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
tilt slightly downward at an angle so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.630 
tilt slightly downward at an angle so
that<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.900> growth<00:02:16.170> channels<00:02:16.769> are<00:02:17.040> completely

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that the growth channels are completely

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.870 
that the growth channels are completely
straight<00:02:17.970> from<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.450> corner<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.400> growth

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
straight from the corner of the growth

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.410 
straight from the corner of the growth
channel<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.870> way<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.470> tip<00:02:23.420> otherwise

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
channel all the way to the tip otherwise

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.839 
channel all the way to the tip otherwise
if<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.290> put<00:02:25.470> them<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.010> forms<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.459> straight

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
if you put them the forms on straight

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.550 
if you put them the forms on straight
the<00:02:27.660> nails<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:28.019> end<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.230> looking<00:02:28.530> like

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the nails will end up looking like

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.300 
the nails will end up looking like
they're<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.519> up

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
they're going up

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.190 
they're going up
yes<00:02:30.430> exactly<00:02:30.670> they'll<00:02:31.300> actually<00:02:31.510> give<00:02:32.080> you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
yes exactly they'll actually give you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.089 
yes exactly they'll actually give you
the<00:02:32.380> impression<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.190> tip<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.459> slightly

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the impression that the tip is slightly

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.100 
the impression that the tip is slightly
curving<00:02:36.099> upwards<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.360> applied<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> forms

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
curving upwards so you applied the forms

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.170 
curving upwards so you applied the forms
and<00:02:38.349> then<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> do<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:42.010> build<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:43.120> of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and then what I do is I build out all of

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.360 
and then what I do is I build out all of
the<00:02:43.690> free<00:02:44.110> edge<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.440> flush<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.860> natural

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the free edge is flush to the natural

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.460 
the free edge is flush to the natural
nail<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.849> then<00:02:45.970> once<00:02:46.209> i'm<00:02:46.330> done<00:02:46.360> building<00:02:47.200> out

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
nail and then once i'm done building out

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.059 
nail and then once i'm done building out
the<00:02:47.709> fifth<00:02:48.640> finger<00:02:49.599> i<00:02:49.810> take<00:02:50.260> off<00:02:50.349> on<00:02:50.530> my<00:02:50.650> forms

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
the fifth finger i take off on my forms

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.190 
the fifth finger i take off on my forms
and<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.340> pinch<00:02:51.640> them<00:02:51.880> into<00:02:52.060> shape<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.989> way<00:02:53.170> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and I pinch them into shape that way I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.440 
and I pinch them into shape that way I
can<00:02:53.290> get<00:02:53.590> them<00:02:53.680> narrow<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.030> started<00:02:55.330> with

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
can get them narrow so you started with

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.089 
can get them narrow so you started with
glitter<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.959> knew<00:02:56.500> start<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.800> glitter<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
glitter I knew start with glitter and

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.259 
glitter I knew start with glitter and
what<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.519> do<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.880> like<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> lay<00:02:58.150> out

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
what I like to do is I like to lay out

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.890 
what I like to do is I like to lay out
my<00:02:58.300> track<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.590> did<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.950> by<00:03:00.130> actually

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
my track and I did that by actually

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.350 
my track and I did that by actually
working<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.930> corners<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:03.370> wanted<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.209> give<00:03:04.330> it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
working the corners I wanted to give it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.789 
working the corners I wanted to give it
an<00:03:04.510> element<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:04.959> actually<00:03:05.319> ran<00:03:05.500> through<00:03:05.709> the

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
an element that actually ran through the

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.770 
an element that actually ran through the
center<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.250> nail<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:06.880> what<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.450> did<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.660> I

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
center of the nail so what I did is I

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.880 
center of the nail so what I did is I
apply<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> little<00:03:08.110> bit<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.380> glitter<00:03:08.620> in<00:03:08.769> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
apply a little bit of glitter in the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.880 
apply a little bit of glitter in the
corners<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.519> then<00:03:10.360> once<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.230> lay<00:03:11.440> down<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
corners and then once I lay down that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.830 
corners and then once I lay down that
track<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.549> do<00:03:12.610> one<00:03:12.910> finger<00:03:13.239> at<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.390> time<00:03:13.420> it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
track and I do one finger at a time it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.050 
track and I do one finger at a time it
makes<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.110> easier<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:14.530> obviously<00:03:15.310> if<00:03:15.640> you're

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
makes it easier but obviously if you're

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520 
makes it easier but obviously if you're
comfortable<00:03:16.299> laying<00:03:16.690> down<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.019> track<00:03:17.260> first

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
comfortable laying down the track first

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.559 
comfortable laying down the track first
then<00:03:17.709> going<00:03:17.920> back<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.250> doing<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.580> color<00:03:18.790> you

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
then going back and doing the color you

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.039 
then going back and doing the color you
can<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.459> what<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.790> must<00:03:22.120> do<00:03:22.420> next<00:03:22.930> is

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
can do that what you must do next is

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.110 
can do that what you must do next is
actually<00:03:23.620> marble<00:03:24.310> eyes<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.610> color<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.030> what

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
actually marble eyes the color and what

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.309 
actually marble eyes the color and what
I<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.480> start<00:03:25.510> with<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> lightest<00:03:26.140> color

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
I do is I start with the lightest color

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.100 
I do is I start with the lightest color
first<00:03:26.650> which<00:03:27.040> was<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.970> soft<00:03:28.209> gold<00:03:28.480> color<00:03:28.780> and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
first which was the soft gold color and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.710 
first which was the soft gold color and
then<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.290> take<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.799> Rouge<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:31.150> lay<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.510> down

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
then I take the Rouge and I lay it down

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.080 
then I take the Rouge and I lay it down
and<00:03:32.170> I'd<00:03:32.319> lightly<00:03:32.920> drag<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.430> through<00:03:33.459> now<00:03:33.700> it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
and I'd lightly drag it through now it's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.500 
and I'd lightly drag it through now it's
really<00:03:34.600> important<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:36.579> try<00:03:36.910> not<00:03:37.269> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
really important that you try not to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.990 
really important that you try not to
cover<00:03:37.810> all<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.350> open<00:03:38.769> space<00:03:39.070> at<00:03:39.340> once<00:03:39.640> if

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
cover all of the open space at once if

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.789 
cover all of the open space at once if
there<00:03:40.329> is<00:03:40.359> open<00:03:40.930> space<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.410> product<00:03:41.680> your

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
there is open space in the product your

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.069 
there is open space in the product your
eyes<00:03:41.890> add<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.670> bit<00:03:42.880> more<00:03:43.120> don't<00:03:43.780> try<00:03:44.049> to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
eyes add a little bit more don't try to

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.740 
eyes add a little bit more don't try to
you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.040> force<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.640> into<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.970> area<00:03:46.329> that's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
you know force it into the area that's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.229 
you know force it into the area that's
that's<00:03:47.109> open<00:03:47.590> or<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.250> colors<00:03:48.579> will<00:03:48.760> blend<00:03:48.970> and

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that's open or the colors will blend and

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.789 
that's open or the colors will blend and
you'll<00:03:49.359> make<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.660> look<00:03:49.810> muddy<00:03:50.049> after<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
you'll make it look muddy after the

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.949 
you'll make it look muddy after the
color<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.160> encased<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.579> all<00:03:51.670> unclear<00:03:52.060> yes<00:03:52.690> I

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
color you encased it all unclear yes I

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.550 
color you encased it all unclear yes I
actually<00:03:53.140> use<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:54.280> speed<00:03:54.970> clear<00:03:55.239> powder<00:03:55.540> too<00:03:56.049> in

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
actually use a speed clear powder too in

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.610 
actually use a speed clear powder too in
case<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:58.030> whole<00:03:58.209> nail<00:03:58.480> from<00:03:58.750> cuticle<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.380> free

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
case the whole nail from cuticle to free

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.319 
case the whole nail from cuticle to free
edge<00:03:59.799> I<00:04:00.100> start<00:04:00.400> from<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.579> cubicle<00:04:00.970> area<00:04:01.060> and

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
edge I start from the cubicle area and

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.059 
edge I start from the cubicle area and
work<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.870> tip<00:04:02.079> because<00:04:02.709> then<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:02.980> can

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
work down to the tip because then I can

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.470 
work down to the tip because then I can
look<00:04:03.250> at<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.400> side<00:04:03.549> profile<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.180> see<00:04:04.329> exactly

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
look at the side profile to see exactly

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.979 
look at the side profile to see exactly
where<00:04:04.900> my<00:04:04.930> upper<00:04:05.319> arch<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.829> once<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.519> have<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
where my upper arch is once I have the

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.080 
where my upper arch is once I have the
whole<00:04:08.170> nail<00:04:08.410> encased<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:09.370> going<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.730> take<00:04:09.910> my

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
whole nail encased I'm going to take my

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.750 
whole nail encased I'm going to take my
tooling<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.950> usually<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.370> tear<00:04:12.579> off<00:04:12.730> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
tooling and I usually like to tear off a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.420 
tooling and I usually like to tear off a
really<00:04:13.239> thin<00:04:13.569> strip<00:04:14.049> what<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.709> want<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.130> do<00:04:15.280> is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
really thin strip what you want to do is

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.009 
really thin strip what you want to do is
you<00:04:15.459> want<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.790> dip<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.150> inside<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.750> powder

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
you want to dip it inside the powder

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.219 
you want to dip it inside the powder
first<00:04:17.609> lay<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.669> over<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:18.970> surface<00:04:19.450> lightly

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
first lay it over the surface lightly

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.620 
first lay it over the surface lightly
press<00:04:20.709> through<00:04:21.100> with<00:04:21.310> even<00:04:21.760> pressure<00:04:21.789> and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
press through with even pressure and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.930 
press through with even pressure and
then<00:04:23.200> what<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:23.979> tap<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.520> surface

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
then what you can do is tap the surface
