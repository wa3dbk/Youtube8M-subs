00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone after i did 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.089
 my hair care videos 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.189
 I was asked to do a care video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.269
 with my face I would like to show you 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 means that I really 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 help to cope with some not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 global issues that just 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 helping not to keep my face normal 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 state and just such things that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.519
 I liked sharing honestly 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 when I started my channel I thought that I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.189
 I will shoot a video exclusively on the topic 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 clothes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.289
 some tips and outfits but all in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 this spirit but besides clothes me often 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
 ask to show some kind of video 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 cosmetic things some care 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 things so basically i'm ready to do 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
 video is not only about clothes 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.100
 but also different care products so 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.480
 let's start all i want to say that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 Macoli is pretty normal 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 and she rarely has any problems 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 global and I rarely appear 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.610
 some rashes or acne but not 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 less I think that skin care 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.809
 need to care anyway need to do 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.879
 various masks clean pores easy 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.859
 put it in order then sighting and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 the first thing I want to show is the masks 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.390
 who help me who are very 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 cool first mask is such a mask from 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 strange movie I called her write 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 somewhere in the video I often 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 showed such masks of his videos 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.210
 because I really consider them 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 one of the best 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 This mask is cleansing from the Dominican 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 a rose this mask cleans the face and gives 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 such an interesting glow face 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 or for how it turns out but this 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.299
 really so the only negative 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 This mask is what you need to keep 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.520
 maximum five minutes because if her 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.950
 hold longer the skin may feel bad 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.820
 react to it may even appear 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 small 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 died but if it is properly used then 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 face really be cool good 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.610
 cleaned well and everything in this spirit is often her 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.510
 I advise my friends and you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 also advise 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.710
 and the next mask is exactly the same firm 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.630
 like the previous ones with me to me 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.210
 there was a big love because i 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 I have never found anything like this before 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.920
 she already told her and said 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.470
 that when you put it on your hands and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 start to rub it then it turns 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.520
 in some kind of hot mix and when we 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.979
 we put it on face it feels so 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 The effect of spam is what Iâ€™m already damaging 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.009
 I can not find anywhere I bought in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.890
 sangi style store 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.470
 but also saw in the store fly 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.860
 it is no more I do not know where I can 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.540
 to find 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.100
 I try as economically as possible 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.989
 use this packaging because 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.610
 I am afraid that is not filed not find a larger but 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.350
 if ever I find again I will 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.450
 Of course, very happy to give mine 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.980
 the most favorite masks i want they like 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.890
 really help me cool 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.830
 coping with the face helps keep it 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.720
 in good condition and just love 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 do you want the next mass that you want 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 show she is so famous I think 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.769
 and many have tried it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.330
 Cucumber mask from the company where freeman 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.310
 you can buy in the shop summer 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.500
 This mask film that also cleans 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.350
 face and tones it at all seems to me 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.200
 all the care items for the face are connected and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.940
 us cucumber they are some kind of straightforward 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.730
 I like everything about it 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.560
 that he has a mask effect that is 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.989
 very funny then peels off 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.209
 especially after watching American 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.910
 horror stories season 2 and somewhere was 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.410
 a maniac who flayed the victims 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.989
 thanks to this masks i feel 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.150
 exactly the victim amusing in general i 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.780
 I heard that many masks from the company Freeman 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.940
 effective and cool but 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.950
 so far only used this 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.110
 maybe try some more masks 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.660
 this company next what would not want 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.400
 get it to scrub in general scrub 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.310
 it is a universal thing because by them 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.990
 you can cleanse your face and body and everything 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.380
 anything so i always try 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.090
 pick a scrub whose are so hard 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.340
 scrub brush 1 stack which 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.100
 I want to show this sensational, too, to all 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.590
 like this here is such a legendary warehouse 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.720
 from the clean line with apricot firstly 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.640
 him a small price and for such 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.860
 small price and quality just 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.290
 chic it can be used on 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.420
 thighs and on the face and generally on the hands where 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.890
 because it is really cool 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.870
 Scrabbles I discovered it for myself 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.330
 I use it for quite a long time or 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.800
 so far I have been using it and generally very straight 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.019
 like if you search for some 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.910
 cool scrub budget but effective 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.620
 This I think you can see this one 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.360
 scrub if you have it of course a little letter 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.330
 there were also the following scrub who want 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.519
 show my favorite absolutely favorite 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.709
 the scrub that I discovered for myself too 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.100
 very long time buying in the store sangi 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.040
 style 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.870
 there he is often in stock seems to me 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.560
 I told them to you, too, has already shown his videos 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.990
 but honestly 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.570
 Even I do not remember its price, in principle, such 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.450
 as low as the clean line scrub 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.610
 they basically stand in one place for 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.530
 my price is much higher and therefore to me 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.300
 like a little more so by 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.090
 grease now I wanted to come to 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.640
 wanted to show you my cream 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.350
 which I have been using for a long time and on 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.270
 that its not me so this 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.460
 moisturizer under the composition is not his 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.530
 can be applied both at night and in the morning and in the afternoon 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.620
 anyway again the price of it 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.320
 very small but very cool effect 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.430
 the smell of this cream is quite pleasant 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.350
 and absolutely not 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.320
 It was very interesting to have a nose giving birth 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.660
 find out what you think about expensive 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.250
 creams and not very expensive do you see 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.990
 big difference and just that 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.150
 would you prefer me very much 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.950
 interesting so write in the comments 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.950
 Well, the last thing you want 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.200
 show this here is apricot oil 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.090
 this oil is just super versatile 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.600
 because it can be applied on the lips 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.330
 and a little can be worn under the eyes and on 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.950
 nail cuticle but mostly i'm this oil 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.960
 using then when I have skin 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.970
 starts to peel off when it's windy 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 cold face starts to react not very 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.660
 good on all these things and on the face can 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.620
 appear some small peeling 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.690
 and these flakings I cover with this 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.060
 apricot butter it is sold in any 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.700
 pharmacy is also not very expensive, and but 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.650
 effect i like like smell and everything 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.600
 in this spirit though you are surely told 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.730
 look at this mass because 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.650
 I think you effect parasites in principle 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.030
 you like the principle you showed everything 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.080
 care products that to me 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.970
 really help 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.770
 which is to me like that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.390
 favorites but besides what we need 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.490
 smear your face with various creams 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.290
 use different masks 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.090
 need of course to watch your 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.160
 food and plum to eat 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.590
 a lot of flour fat 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.120
 I think the face will not be fine then I 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.920
 would like to say if you want to 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.260
 face was clean without acne 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.800
 I think you still need to exclude 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.419
 flour and 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.520
 true i think this is all i wanted you 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.470
 I hope to tell and show you 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.690
 I liked this video I hope you learned 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.050
 from him something interesting with ships not 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.819
 I promise to make a lot of videos on style 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.220
 clothes because I still have more 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:38.409
 like clothes rather than cosmetics and me 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:44.349
 I think that you will see you soon and everyone. 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.349
 cars drive a quantity
