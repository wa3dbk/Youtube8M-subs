00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
speak there's gold hardware and there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
speak there's gold hardware and there
was<00:01:00.269> gold<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.929> pickups<00:01:01.489> but<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.910> being

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
was gold on the pickups but just being

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.889 
was gold on the pickups but just being
in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> bar<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.050> sweaty<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.670> know

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
in the bar and sweaty and you know

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.060 
in the bar and sweaty and you know
probably<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.440> beer<00:01:07.649> dripping

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
probably a little bit of beer dripping

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.419 
probably a little bit of beer dripping
on<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.429> that<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:10.229> gold<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> worn<00:01:11.039> off<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
on to that the gold is worn off the

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:12.980 
on to that the gold is worn off the
pickups<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.300> kind<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.570> looks<00:01:12.720> weird

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pickups and so it kind of looks weird

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.809 
pickups and so it kind of looks weird
looks<00:01:13.259> like<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.530> replaced<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> pickups<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:14.819 
looks like I replaced the pickups like I

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.309 
looks like I replaced the pickups like I
said<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.240> heavy<00:01:15.509> guitar<00:01:15.899> and<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.289> a

said it's very heavy guitar and it has a

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.389 
said it's very heavy guitar and it has a
darker<00:01:17.420> tone<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.810> makes<00:01:19.020> any<00:01:19.140> sense<00:01:19.399> it's

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
darker tone if that makes any sense it's

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.460 
darker tone if that makes any sense it's
very<00:01:20.580> much<00:01:20.849> like<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.300> humbucker<00:01:22.020> Les<00:01:22.229> Paul

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.070 
very much like the humbucker Les Paul
thing<00:01:22.800> but<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.759> warmer<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> darker

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
guitar and I usually do it on this

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.449 
guitar and I usually do it on this
guitar<00:02:38.050> because<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.070> take<00:02:39.100> it

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
guitar because I know it can take it

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.910 
guitar because I know it can take it
because<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.880> built<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.209> tough

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.380

pinstriping<00:02:50.930> thing<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.349> got<00:02:51.530> done<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:52.069> this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
pinstriping thing I got done I this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.580 
pinstriping thing I got done I this
guitar<00:02:53.330> when<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.540> got<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.900> from<00:02:54.020> Heritage<00:02:54.410> was

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
guitar when I got it from Heritage was

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.190 
guitar when I got it from Heritage was
just<00:02:54.800> all<00:02:54.980> black<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.550> white<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:56.060> cold<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
just all black and white with cold and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.180 
just all black and white with cold and
then<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:58.540> got<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.660> wild<00:03:00.080> idea<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> thought

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
then I got this wild idea that I thought

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.400 
then I got this wild idea that I thought
it<00:03:01.280> would<00:03:01.400> look<00:03:01.550> cool<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.120> I'd<00:03:02.840> seen<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> done

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
it would look cool and I'd seen it done

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.870 
it would look cool and I'd seen it done
a<00:03:03.440> few<00:03:03.709> times<00:03:03.950> I'm<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.220> Billy<00:03:04.610> Gibbons

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
a few times I'm like Billy Gibbons

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.020 
a few times I'm like Billy Gibbons
guitars<00:03:05.680> where<00:03:06.680> he'd<00:03:07.040> have<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> pinstripe<00:03:07.850> like

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
guitars where he'd have a pinstripe like

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.210 
guitars where he'd have a pinstripe like
a<00:03:08.060> hot<00:03:08.300> rod<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.780> really<00:03:09.200> wanted<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.739> do<00:03:10.069> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
a hot rod and I really wanted to do that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.729 
a hot rod and I really wanted to do that
on<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:10.489> guitar<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.450> took<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.200> amp<00:03:12.560> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
on this guitar so I took that amp and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.800 
on this guitar so I took that amp and
this<00:03:12.860> guitar<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.430> hotrod<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.209> guy<00:03:14.420> up<00:03:14.630> from

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.229 
this guitar to a hotrod a guy up from
Michigan<00:03:15.200> he<00:03:15.400> said<00:03:16.400> hey<00:03:16.519> man<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.209> ever

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
Michigan he said hey man have you ever

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.170 
Michigan he said hey man have you ever
done<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.599> guitar<00:03:18.050> before<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.560> he<00:03:18.620> said<00:03:19.150> no<00:03:20.150> but

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
done a guitar before and he said no but

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.410 
done a guitar before and he said no but
we<00:03:20.360> can<00:03:20.569> try<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.250> he<00:03:22.250> he<00:03:22.670> did<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:23.239> by<00:03:23.390> hand

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
we can try so he he did this all by hand

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.820 
we can try so he he did this all by hand
all<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.110> pinstripe<00:03:24.620> work<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.069> I<00:03:26.650> guess<00:03:27.650> it's

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
all this pinstripe work and I guess it's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.800 
all this pinstripe work and I guess it's
just<00:03:27.860> paint<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.519> he<00:03:29.180> didn't<00:03:29.420> put<00:03:29.600> anything

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
just paint and he didn't put anything

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.630 
just paint and he didn't put anything
over<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.470> it's<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.860> it's<00:03:30.980> really<00:03:31.190> good<00:03:31.340> paint

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
over and it's and it's really good paint

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.520 
over and it's and it's really good paint
like<00:03:31.850> automotive<00:03:32.239> paint<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:32.989> never<00:03:33.170> worn

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
like automotive paint so it's never worn

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.400 
like automotive paint so it's never worn
