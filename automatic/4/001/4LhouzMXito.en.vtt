let's just say the open e the high E is
going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.489> easier<00:02:09.090> than<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.780> low<00:02:09.959> E

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
going to be easier than the low E

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170 
going to be easier than the low E
because<00:02:10.560> you've<00:02:10.679> gotta<00:02:10.890> reach<00:02:11.400> fervor

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
because you've gotta reach fervor

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.940 
because you've gotta reach fervor
the<00:02:12.299> LOI<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.719> let's<00:02:12.900> start<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.620> high<00:02:13.920> E

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the LOI so let's start on the high E

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.009 
the LOI so let's start on the high E
it's<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.000> first<00:02:15.209> thing<00:02:15.359> I<00:02:15.569> want<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it's the first thing I want you to be

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:23.809 
it's the first thing I want you to be
able<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.739> i'm<00:02:22.859> picking<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.310> same<00:02:23.519> note

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
able to do so i'm picking the same note

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.690 
able to do so i'm picking the same note
over<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.510> over<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.349> I'm<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.769> rolling<00:02:26.250> in

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
over and over and I'm just rolling in

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.069 
over and over and I'm just rolling in
the<00:02:26.879> volume<00:02:27.269> each<00:02:27.450> time<00:02:29.060> rolling<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.209> off<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
the volume each time rolling it off so

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.839 
the volume each time rolling it off so
the<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.500> part<00:02:37.739> where<00:02:37.889> you<00:02:37.980> roll<00:02:38.189> it<00:02:38.340> off<00:02:38.430> it's

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
the the part where you roll it off it's

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.789 
the the part where you roll it off it's
equally<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.480> important<00:02:40.019> as<00:02:40.170> rolling<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> up

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
equally as important as rolling it up

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.220 
equally as important as rolling it up
and<00:02:41.129> perhaps<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.000> more<00:02:42.150> difficult<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and perhaps a little more difficult you

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.259 
and perhaps a little more difficult you
know<00:02:43.290> you've<00:02:43.709> got<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.980> bring<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.639> down<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.970> zero

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
know you've got to bring it down to zero

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.490 
know you've got to bring it down to zero
without<00:02:45.989> moving<00:02:46.889> your<00:02:46.919> finger<00:02:47.400> too<00:02:47.609> far<00:02:47.879> down

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
without moving your finger too far down

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.649 
without moving your finger too far down
so<00:02:49.500> that's<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> hard<00:02:50.730> thing<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:51.060> itself<00:02:51.419> and

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
so that's the hard thing in itself and

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:59.839 
so that's the hard thing in itself and
I'd<00:02:51.720> get<00:02:51.930> good<00:02:52.139> at<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.560> begin<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:58.849> so

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
I'd get good at that to begin with so

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.179 
I'd get good at that to begin with so
after<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.209> little<00:03:00.329> practice<00:03:00.629> doing<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.349> you

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
after a little practice doing that you

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.539 
after a little practice doing that you
could<00:03:02.370> start<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.969> apply<00:03:03.389> scales<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.040> so

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
could start to apply scales to it so

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.159 
could start to apply scales to it so
what<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:05.939> gonna<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.329> I'm<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.870> run

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
what I'm gonna do I'm just going to run

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.789 
what I'm gonna do I'm just going to run
an<00:03:07.409> E<00:03:07.859> minor<00:03:08.099> pentatonic<00:03:08.669> scale<00:03:09.299> here<00:03:09.719> we<00:03:10.530> back

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
an E minor pentatonic scale here we back

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.379 
an E minor pentatonic scale here we back
up<00:03:10.829> a<00:03:11.159> little<00:03:11.280> bit<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> could<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.209> I'm

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
up a little bit so you could see I'm

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.819 
up a little bit so you could see I'm
gonna<00:03:12.540> play<00:03:12.780> Annie<00:03:13.579> then<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.609> G<00:03:14.909> yeah<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
gonna play Annie then a G yeah then I

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.690 
gonna play Annie then a G yeah then I
better<00:03:17.629> be<00:03:19.159> an<00:03:20.159> addy

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
better be an addy

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:35.759 
better be an addy
I<00:03:23.489> put<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.520> together<00:03:29.550> yeah<00:03:34.530> when<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> get

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
I put that together yeah when you get

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.650 
I put that together yeah when you get
good<00:03:35.920> at<00:03:36.069> that<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.730> could<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> same<00:03:37.330> thing

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
good at that you could do the same thing

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.390 
good at that you could do the same thing
on<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> B<00:03:38.050> string<00:03:38.110> see<00:03:38.830> if<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.980> can<00:03:39.099> follow<00:03:39.280> a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
on the B string see if you can follow a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.430 
on the B string see if you can follow a
scale<00:03:39.700> up<00:03:39.910> there<00:03:40.120> same<00:03:40.480> scale<00:03:40.840> starting<00:03:41.349> on

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
scale up there same scale starting on

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:51.330 
scale up there same scale starting on
the<00:03:41.590> B<00:03:41.769> note<00:03:49.080> perhaps<00:03:50.080> we<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.680> progress<00:03:51.040> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the B note perhaps we can progress to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.479 
the B note perhaps we can progress to
the<00:03:51.580> G<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.379> said<00:03:53.440> earlier<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.459> I

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
the G and like I said earlier it so I

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.210 
the G and like I said earlier it so I
sort<00:03:54.849> of<00:03:54.940> progress<00:03:55.120> up<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.660> strings<00:03:56.220> it's

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
sort of progress up the strings it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.819 
sort of progress up the strings it's
getting<00:03:57.700> more<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.239> us<00:03:58.540> because<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.349> little

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
getting more to us because that little

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.699 
getting more to us because that little
fingers<00:04:00.370> got<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.700> work<00:04:00.940> harder<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:02.470> do<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
fingers got to work harder to do the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:15.030 
fingers got to work harder to do the
stretch<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.739> day<00:04:13.260> get<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> little<00:04:14.590> more<00:04:14.739> tricky

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
stretch the day get a little more tricky

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:28.890 
stretch the day get a little more tricky
in<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.459> lastly<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.900> low<00:04:23.110> E

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.420 

no<00:04:29.490> okay<00:04:30.490> right<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.949> once<00:04:32.949> you've<00:04:33.190> sort<00:04:33.400> of

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
no okay right so once you've sort of

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.210 
no okay right so once you've sort of
graduated<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.690> level<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.710> can<00:04:35.919> try

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
graduated to that level you can try

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.999 
graduated to that level you can try
going<00:04:37.150> across<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.900> strings<00:04:38.110> perhaps<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.949> could

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
going across the strings perhaps I could

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.640 
going across the strings perhaps I could
do<00:04:39.280> another<00:04:39.910> pentatonic<00:04:40.539> scale<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.500> this

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
do another pentatonic scale but this

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.980 
do another pentatonic scale but this
time<00:04:41.860> moving<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.520> other<00:04:42.729> way<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:43.690> if<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:43.930> start

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
time moving the other way so if I start

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:55.740 
time moving the other way so if I start
in<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.979> know<00:04:45.100> position<00:04:45.580> while<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.820> can<00:04:54.690> now<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
in you know position while I can now the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.170 
in you know position while I can now the
trick<00:04:56.110> about<00:04:56.350> this<00:04:56.650> as<00:04:56.800> well<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.250> making<00:04:58.000> sure

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
trick about this as well is making sure

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.210 
trick about this as well is making sure
that<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.449> don't<00:04:58.630> roll<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.139> volume<00:04:59.560> up<00:04:59.710> too

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
that you don't roll the volume up too

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.400 
that you don't roll the volume up too
far<00:05:00.580> each<00:05:00.850> time<00:05:01.090> because<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:01.990> roll<00:05:02.229> the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
far each time because if you roll the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.409 
far each time because if you roll the
volume<00:05:02.740> up<00:05:02.889> too<00:05:03.100> far<00:05:03.430> you're<00:05:03.760> going<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.030> really

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
volume up too far you're going to really

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.810 
volume up too far you're going to really
struggle<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.440> get<00:05:05.979> it<00:05:06.100> all<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.370> way<00:05:06.490> back<00:05:06.760> down

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
you're going to be burning a lot of

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.790 
you're going to be burning a lot of
energy<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.720> know<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:10.900> want<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.169> keep<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.530> sort

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
energy you know you want to keep it sort

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.700 
energy you know you want to keep it sort

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:31.830 

if<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:20.949> did<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.910> see<00:05:31.120> in<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.449> middle<00:05:31.780> of

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
if it I did you see in the middle of

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.689 
if it I did you see in the middle of
that<00:05:32.020> lick<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.560> I<00:05:32.620> did<00:05:32.889> there<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.310> rolled<00:05:33.610> it

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
that lick that I did there I rolled it

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.150 
that lick that I did there I rolled it
up<00:05:33.820> too<00:05:34.090> much<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:35.199> compromise<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.010> quality

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
up too much and I compromise the quality

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.290 
up too much and I compromise the quality
of<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:37.090> next<00:05:37.389> note<00:05:37.599> so<00:05:38.380> it's<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.620> bounce<00:05:39.300> but

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
of the next note so it's a bounce but

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.580 
of the next note so it's a bounce but
it's<00:05:40.449> good<00:05:40.599> fun<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:42.449> suppose<00:05:43.449> that'll<00:05:44.440> be

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
it's good fun so I suppose that'll be

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.700 
it's good fun so I suppose that'll be
enough<00:05:44.889> for<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.610> be<00:05:45.729> getting<00:05:46.000> on<00:05:46.060> with<00:05:46.120> so
