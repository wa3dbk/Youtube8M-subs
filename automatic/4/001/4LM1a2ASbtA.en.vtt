00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.639
 hey people welcome to the second part 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.500
 of gaming pc build yourself today with that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.330
 insert the memory on the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.820
 mainboard installed the corsair vengeance 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.650
 16 gb and that means four modules in total 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.590
 16gb maybe a short unboxing yet 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 here to engine space is packed so 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.680
 does not count so well but is now 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 not so important when the dram 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.210
 module use 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 which does not occupy all four slots here 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.790
 you have to take care in which 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.809
 order the slots occupied that stands 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.600
 in the user manual of the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 mainboards in my case that 877 v the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.489
 ram module of corsair vengeance him 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 pretty high as you see with high 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.590
 I do not have to hit boards 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.369
 pay attention in which order I the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 modules here inserts because I all anyway 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.439
 evidence and that does not matter to action so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:20.540
 which brother space is me 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:24.299
 look for a bit more here 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.299
 on the ram slots you can see little ones 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 notches the same a chamberlain 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.500
 that you are the counterpart to that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.659
 ram modules you can see here 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.229
 and that's how it looks like then 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 how you have to use the modules 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 In my case that is so and around the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.689
 use modules 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.100
 There is only one page on the mainboard 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.630
 someone can open up here in the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.969
 mounts the other side is here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:01.320
 fix everyone on that means you have to 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.210
 first here on this page and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.030
 then on the other side then 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.330
 evenly down to the slot 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 Press on it and click on it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.129
 the other side reveals that the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.129
 mentioned yourself 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.490
 at the same time made with the other modules 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.490
 pressed in here on all pages 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 they are fixed automatically so if 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.959
 here only two slots occupy 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.650
 you want then you just in the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.239
 Check the manual of the mainboard 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.010
 which places most of the time 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.599
 will that be the two, I believe 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 that will be the two blue ones in mine 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.670
 case 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.140
 and yes it is not in principle either 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.519
 heavy 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.450
 you just have to pay attention to the score 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.440
 that it is used right here 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.700
 and then you just have to 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.840
 halfway evenly, the pure pushes in 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.060
 a little bit more on the side 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.110
 So first on the side you the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.130
 does not close up 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.239
 is connected 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.690
 and then you can just do it here 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.690
 indent 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.170
 the frames set the ram module 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.950
 Replace in the room instead of pretty fix in it 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 you can not do that much wrong either 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.760
 if you pay attention to what i do 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.950
 said 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.580
 before mainboard and the parts at almost 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.670
 you should always earth and yes im 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.290
 next part we will then the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.720
 Place cpu-cooler on the base and 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.960
 make that yes and until the next 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960
 times
