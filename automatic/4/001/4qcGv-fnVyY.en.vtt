here that way we can tell what you're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
here that way we can tell what you're
doing<00:00:24.090> there's<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.080> small<00:00:25.380> squares<00:00:25.859> with

doing there's some small squares with
information<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> need<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> fill<00:00:27.840> out

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.810 

your<00:00:31.380> layers<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.890> you're<00:00:32.009> coloring<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.550> here

the small squares of information are

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040 
the small squares of information are
here<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> asks<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> composition

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here and it asks for the composition

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.319 
here and it asks for the composition
that<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.410> means<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.920> made<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
that just means what it's made out of

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.780 
that just means what it's made out of
how<00:00:39.329> thick<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.040> what<00:00:41.040> state<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> matter

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
how thick it is what state of matter

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
how thick it is what state of matter
it's<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.050> are<00:00:43.110> solid

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it's in because some of these are solid

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's in because some of these are solid
and<00:00:43.710> some<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.190> liquid<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.390> need

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and some of them are liquid and we need

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940 
and some of them are liquid and we need
to<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:45.899> sure<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> understand<00:00:46.800> which

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to make sure that you understand which

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
to make sure that you understand which
layers<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> earth<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.850> solids<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.780> which

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
layers of the earth are solids and which

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.619 
layers of the earth are solids and which
ones<00:00:49.200> are<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> liquids

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
ones are the liquids

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.670 
ones are the liquids
you're<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> cut<00:00:52.199> those<00:00:52.379> layers

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you're going to need to cut those layers

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.400 
you're going to need to cut those layers
out<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.460> cut<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> four<00:00:54.420> squares<00:00:54.809> don't

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
out and cut out the four squares don't

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.479 
out and cut out the four squares don't
worry<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.649> cutting<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> twelve

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
in so when you cut your layers out do

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.840 
in so when you cut your layers out do
your<00:01:01.530> best<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.890> stick<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> lines<00:01:02.550> cut

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
your best to stick with the lines cut

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
your best to stick with the lines cut
off<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> top<00:01:03.239> layer<00:01:03.619> this<00:01:04.619> next<00:01:05.010> layer<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.460> do

off the top layer this next layer you do

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
off the top layer this next layer you do
not<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> cut<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.140> Center

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
not have to cut out all of these Center

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.210 
not have to cut out all of these Center
lines<00:01:07.950> already<00:01:08.250> exterior<00:01:09.119> lines<00:01:10.100> when<00:01:11.100> you're

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

finished<00:01:18.830> you'll<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.040> four<00:01:20.369> separate

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
finished you'll have four separate

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
finished you'll have four separate
layers<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> earth<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.049> finished

layers of the earth when you're finished

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
layers of the earth when you're finished
that<00:01:22.740> looked<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:27.119> will<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.479> need

that looked like this you will also need

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.819 
that looked like this you will also need
to<00:01:27.990> cut<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.710> title<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.590> four

sheet of paper there we're going to make
this<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> foldable<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.579> do

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this into a foldable the way that we do

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.030 
this into a foldable the way that we do
it<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.600> lay<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.380> sheets<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> paper

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it is we lay one of our sheets of paper

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.289 
it is we lay one of our sheets of paper
down<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.140> ahead<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.740> glue<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
down and we go ahead and glue on the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.940 
down and we go ahead and glue on the
title<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> upper<00:01:48.409> layer<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> earth

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
the lithosphere

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.450 
the lithosphere
next<00:01:53.109> we<00:01:53.229> lay<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.499> second<00:01:53.859> sheet<00:01:54.039> down<00:01:54.189> right

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
next we lay the second sheet down right

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.989 
next we lay the second sheet down right
below<00:01:54.819> that<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.439> that<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.710> can<00:01:56.890> flip<00:01:57.609> that<00:01:57.789> end

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
below that so that you can flip that end

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:03.179 
below that so that you can flip that end
up<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:59.049> we<00:01:59.259> put<00:01:59.499> down<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.920> Manta<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.950> from

got all those pieces glued on and you

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.430 
got all those pieces glued on and you
should<00:02:27.489> have<00:02:27.700> already<00:02:27.910> colored<00:02:28.329> them<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:29.260> can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
should have already colored them you can

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.559 
should have already colored them you can
put<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:29.980> information<00:02:30.269> squares<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.480> there

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
put your information squares and there

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.819 
put your information squares and there
are<00:02:31.660> labels<00:02:31.930> for<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.319> outer<00:02:32.500> core<00:02:32.799> is

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
are labels for the outer core is

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.640 
are labels for the outer core is
information<00:02:33.489> square<00:02:33.840> will<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:34.989> underneath<00:02:35.290> of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
information square will go underneath of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.800 
information square will go underneath of
the<00:02:36.099> outer<00:02:36.280> core<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.299> will<00:02:37.450> flip<00:02:37.629> up<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the outer core so we will flip up the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.949 
the outer core so we will flip up the
outer<00:02:38.079> core<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.799> its<00:02:38.950> information<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
outer core we see its information the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.410 
outer core we see its information the
inner<00:02:41.200> core<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.560> information<00:02:42.250> square<00:02:42.579> would

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
inner core is information square would

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.830 
inner core is information square would
go<00:02:43.569> underneath<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.109> inner<00:02:44.290> core<00:02:45.569> so<00:02:46.569> when<00:02:46.720> we

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
go underneath the inner core so when we

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.660 
go underneath the inner core so when we
flip<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.079> up<00:02:47.319> we<00:02:47.470> see<00:02:47.680> its<00:02:47.829> information<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
flip it up we see its information and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.479 
flip it up we see its information and
finally<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.870> mantle<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.560> crust<00:02:51.160> but

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
finally the mantle and the crust but

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.000 
finally the mantle and the crust but
both<00:02:51.849> of<00:02:51.879> those<00:02:52.180> underneath<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.900> mantle<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
both of those underneath the mantle so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.520 
both of those underneath the mantle so
when<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.280> flip<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.730> mantle<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.239> we<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.380> its

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
when we flip the mantle up we see its

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.400 
when we flip the mantle up we see its
information<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:58.209> can<00:02:58.359> take<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.569> stapler<00:02:59.109> and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
information you can take a stapler and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.979 
information you can take a stapler and
staple<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.280> bottom<00:03:00.579> together<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.810> when

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
staple the bottom together and when

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.660 
staple the bottom together and when
you're<00:03:02.109> finished<00:03:02.500> you'll<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> foldable

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
you're finished you'll have a foldable

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.640 
you're finished you'll have a foldable
that<00:03:03.940> shows<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.480> Earth's<00:03:04.660> layers<00:03:04.959> that

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
that shows you the Earth's layers that

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.069 
that shows you the Earth's layers that
you<00:03:05.799> can<00:03:05.950> use<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> reference<00:03:06.700> material<00:03:07.419> just

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
you can use as a reference material just

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.240 
you can use as a reference material just
to<00:03:08.139> help<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.380> study<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.859> test<00:03:08.889> or
