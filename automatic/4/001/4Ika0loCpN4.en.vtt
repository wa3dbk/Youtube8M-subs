00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 The game was actually already after 20 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.420
 minutes to end for us but the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 team has fortunately a moral 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.060
 shown and the fans conveyed that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.080
 even with the clear residue ready 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.880
 is everything to give 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.230
 It turned out very well because she 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 then did not do well in the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 second half, of course, clearest 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 Do not miss opportunities 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.090
 already over 70 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.679
 someday the equalizer 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.630
 The chances were there 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 drink to the gate 10 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 even then she does not hang herself 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.180
 and still gets right up to 3 2 has 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.980
 another three minutes but that was still 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 obviously too late after the 0 2 itself 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 It takes a few minutes to get there 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 sure to find it was a little uneasy 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 the stadium but we have always 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.710
 again possibilities but we have gas 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 also given a second half 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.860
 even after the 0 3 we are always 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.629
 have run again the pace 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 We were held high by many 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.870
 opportunities are thereby created 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 one or the other situation that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 luck is missing but many good ones 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.359
 but there are clear we may 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.729
 Of course we do not get two goals 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.810
 in your own stadium and then it will be 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.170
 Of course, such a game is difficult 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 win 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 I actually felt good 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 that's not how I can really do it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.600
 Of course, I can only do it at the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.000
 apologize fans the gamblers he was 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.970
 I clearly have my own business 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.570
 just want to stand and check off like that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.920
 it happens so it is when I have one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.259
 Mistakes are most of the time today 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 It was twice like that and we'll do that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.409
 Nevertheless, we now want the reproach 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.360
 do it first 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.729
 the one who maybe mistakes behind 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.009
 Does he lead to death or the year old 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.110
 the front clearest chances are not 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.909
 But he makes his position 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.799
 a mistake and my theory that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.540
 lessons are always a bit cabin 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 certainly not happy at the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 both actions but not so great 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.090
 other people already shown 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.579
 there are always days out here 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 the shit on the foot as they say so beautiful 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.540
 and this time we have to go through it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.100
 straighten up again and the next game 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.110
 comes faster than we can watch 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.729
 proves that we are full as a team 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.899
 and behind him are certainly standing 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.760
 as a goalkeeper if you have a mistake 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.340
 doing 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.050
 you see you look bad he has 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.330
 It was a first half 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.620
 a little bit unhappy though 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.970
 so some points to be saved and how 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.020
 Said we stand behind them yes 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.550
 Today I think so 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.470
 little bit of luck was missing the goalkeeper 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.290
 I always thought that was the right way to go 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.900
 a good game and yes 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.610
 said there were enough there I have to 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.020
 must play out my chance 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.630
 The team has a clear advantage 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.620
 after the early 0 2 residue is that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.120
 Do not just go back to the game 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.920
 communicate that well done anyway 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.470
 when of course his two hintendran 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.430
 In the back then I am already a role model 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.470
 have come back again and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.440
 ultimately until the last second 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.890
 could also have gotten a point 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.510
 that's not what I am doing right now 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 grieved when we 0 3 home 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.170
 it is even worse but we are clear 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.730
 of course we want to play at home 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.860
 win and win today 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.360
 we climbed right and that's it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.280
 what a pity if you have the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.320
 possibility then by a through the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 win by the home win times right 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.020
 create a leap yes 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.459
 strangely never but how do you come 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.480
 back sometime you have that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.470
 seen today plays we come back 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.459
 always get in the table too 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.739
 back though again 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.209
 if we had a defeat when 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.350
 all here then say for the sake of God 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 then we come back but we 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.030
 never do it in a row 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.680
 away and that's annoying stupid game 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.750
 Today have been two stupid goals 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.910
 the gates was not made after 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 then return safely are there 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.570
 you have to be happy then if 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.790
 at least until the last second 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.830
 can keep the game open now 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.450
 probably very big so if you are 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.880
 See what you want to get there 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.080
 are not easy opponents and play 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.180
 was a very important game for us 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.230
 it was clear from the outset that we were us 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.820
 unfortunately we did not do that 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.380
 but I can still implement 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.190
 One hundred percent trust in this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.600
 team 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.040
 we have a great rest program for you 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.900
 now even felix big falls 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.480
 remaining preliminary round out because one 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.080
 tearing in the knee was noted 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.970
 nils also falls sebastian prÃ¶dl falls 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.489
 anyway it is about the complete 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.560
 preliminary round that is bitter that the right one 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.630
 but if we can do so 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 keep like today after the residue 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.060
 become 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.830
 Score the team is intact 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.209
 a team as I said again and again 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.209
 come back because we do not sow
