65<00:00:35.920> this<00:00:36.920> Hypertherm<00:00:37.520> 65<00:00:38.680> we<00:00:39.680> bought<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:39.980> with

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
65 this Hypertherm 65 we bought it with

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.799 
65 this Hypertherm 65 we bought it with
a<00:00:40.130> machine<00:00:40.310> torch<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.239> comes<00:00:41.510> with<00:00:41.780> a

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
a machine torch so it comes with a
