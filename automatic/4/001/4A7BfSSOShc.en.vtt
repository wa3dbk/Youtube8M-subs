00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
demonstration that in this episode and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.779

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
the clock hands the clock and that Kaito

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.460 
the clock hands the clock and that Kaito
kid<00:05:01.160> was<00:05:01.280> trying<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.550> steal<00:05:01.610> is<00:05:02.440> actually<00:05:03.440> a

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
kid was trying to steal is actually a

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.159 
kid was trying to steal is actually a
fake<00:05:04.070> clocking<00:05:04.940> like<00:05:05.090> being<00:05:05.330> Jim's<00:05:05.660> inside<00:05:06.080> of

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
fake clocking like being Jim's inside of

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.779 
fake clocking like being Jim's inside of
it<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.350> diamonds<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.830> stuff<00:05:06.889> were<00:05:07.190> fake<00:05:07.520> and

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
it the diamonds and stuff were fake and

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.969 
it the diamonds and stuff were fake and
so<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.510> overall<00:05:08.870> objective<00:05:09.320> that<00:05:09.440> Kaito<00:05:09.680> kids

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
so the overall objective that Kaito kids

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.230 
so the overall objective that Kaito kids
set<00:05:10.190> out<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.580> know<00:05:10.699> working<00:05:10.880> from<00:05:11.120> the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
set out you know working from the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.850 
set out you know working from the
Philosopher's<00:05:11.750> Stone<00:05:11.780> through<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.500> Jin's<00:05:12.710> a

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
Philosopher's Stone through the Jin's a

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.050 
Philosopher's Stone through the Jin's a
lot<00:05:12.979> looking<00:05:13.190> from<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.400> other<00:05:13.430> gym<00:05:13.729> inside

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
lot looking from the other gym inside

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.960 
lot looking from the other gym inside
one<00:05:14.330> well<00:05:14.960> pretty<00:05:15.349> much<00:05:15.560> his<00:05:16.160> objective<00:05:16.760> of

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
one well pretty much his objective of

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.610 
one well pretty much his objective of
finding<00:05:17.330> gems<00:05:17.570> in<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.840> car<00:05:18.020> can<00:05:18.229> technically

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
finding gems in the car can technically

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.670 
finding gems in the car can technically
were<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.800> failure<00:05:19.070> because<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.970> gyms<00:05:20.270> were

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
were a failure because the gyms were

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.140 
were a failure because the gyms were
replicas<00:05:21.680> they<00:05:22.039> they<00:05:22.310> weren't<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.669> real<00:05:22.880> gems

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
replicas they they weren't the real gems

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.120 
replicas they they weren't the real gems
that<00:05:23.270> were<00:05:23.360> sold<00:05:23.599> off<00:05:23.900> by<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.259> owner<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.949> the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
that were sold off by the owner of the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.580 
that were sold off by the owner of the
clock<00:05:25.370> hands<00:05:25.669> so<00:05:26.090> Kaito<00:05:26.570> Kidd<00:05:26.900> revealed<00:05:27.320> this

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
clock hands so Kaito Kidd revealed this

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.339 
clock hands so Kaito Kidd revealed this
to<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:27.949> entire<00:05:28.250> public<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.970> he<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.050> left

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
to the entire public and he just left

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.750 
to the entire public and he just left
you<00:05:30.710> didn't<00:05:30.919> really<00:05:31.039> mean<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.250> steal<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
you didn't really mean to steal the

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.490 
you didn't really mean to steal the
clock<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.690> that's<00:05:32.930> pretty<00:05:33.110> much<00:05:33.229> how<00:05:33.349> the

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
clock and so that's pretty much how the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.040 
clock and so that's pretty much how the
conclusion<00:05:34.370> of<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:35.060> episode<00:05:35.449> of<00:05:35.599> magic<00:05:35.900> kaito

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050

are<00:05:57.409> not<00:05:57.560> that<00:05:57.770> visible<00:05:58.070> unless<00:05:58.370> you're

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
are not that visible unless you're

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.550

for<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:03.260> most<00:06:03.409> part<00:06:03.620> was<00:06:03.740> very<00:06:03.919> solid<00:06:04.250> when<00:06:04.550> it

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
for the most part was very solid when it

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.339 
for the most part was very solid when it
came<00:06:04.760> to<00:06:04.940> up-close<00:06:05.419> characters<00:06:05.960> along<00:06:06.169> with
