00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.500
 and people from fairy tales too quickly but respect and welcome to a new contract 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.169
 but you left today 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.889
 the burglar who really do for me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 He wants to be very special, because there is now also a pot of tomorrow 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.650
 2 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.860
 this is only my second new peak to be picked up 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.670
 at least the computer might also be on the playstation 3 I was shocked by the pair 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.500
 achieved 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 that would not but know where you live 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.640
 this is my they did now also on the computer i have it was two minutes too 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 cut cut 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.950
 I have not played there that long, I think I have something of 5 6 hours 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.909
 on the counter 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.410
 I've only had two weeks 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.640
 yet 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.520
 i'm not the best 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.360
 informed kills the idea is the same in the world at the time of the murder 3 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.820
 nice boost but never possibly achieved because 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.120
 it's just about kids 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.460
 24 or fifty films make it important that we go Sunday 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 unfortunately I am not that good but it is a shame it would be nice to our camper 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.360
 to use ever 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 unfortunately i also had it stolen it actually goes 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.540
 never really before 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.210
 and so maybe you can use it but people but can't even do it 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.740
 about children 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 but easy to talk about the game at least good to see that silly 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.330
 mill becomes 2 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.870
 very many people who were now themselves in meet the black ops 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 and that mail itself and that case 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.870
 its time of people i just go back nice and chill 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.680
 but tomorrow 2 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.850
 how much bullshit smoke is being trapped in remains fun to play 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870
 said that a lot of people are also getting busier 2 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.020
 admittedly moammar disappeared, however, the hearings game is stuck 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 yes of course he ended up in standard dirk fox news hour fair 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 who had the mat online wide one can get a high of it all 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 the new keyloggers are just normal people who have been around for an hour or three 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.680
 the kind of bullshit that was in it 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.120
 the only way 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.909
 Surely that people back because of it 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 was fun to play despite the bullshit 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.680
 to the fullest in my opinion is that now a little level of computer away 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.669
 think especially that most trawlers 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.319
 so has bothers 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.829
 according to is with dutch french and english 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.379
 I think most people just love the game again 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.730
 so I am very happy with that, nobody could stand those things anymore 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.109
 for us of course 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.139
 year 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.299
 those who do that the ones I don't meet at all anymore, luckily I am whole 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.059
 glad because i can't do anything so left to people like that 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.149
 again nice to do with kill switch 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:42.009
 grol could also continue like this 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.839
 the men could easily fashion with the men, but I can really do that 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.849
 detection gate think 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.400
 but luckily a bit off on those people follow me a little lol 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.599
 have been hit afterwards 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.539
 that's nice too 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.599
 I want you to ask the question 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.969
 what vernay you actually come from 2 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.229
 are you kind of like this 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.259
 no matter how much forest it is in, I keep going back or 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.369
 osn the they solve themselves criticism it does not go into the play a role maybe 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.969
 If you can't get an opinion, let us know in the comments that is why I am 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:15.879
 so curious where 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.889
 i actually think so 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.639
 by two best fun to play so 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.199
 jacob this is I never find tanks that I can play all day long because 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.379
 yes then I just have to fall completely crazy 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.430
 and the same thing but tomorrow 2 it's just fun to play for two hours 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.089
 but not for a long time 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.869
 We also have a culture that some people who can put your interests on 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.259
 I just can't play the card 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.249
 in that respect I am simply a different call of duty 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.489
 i like to play 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.889
 which you actually not sure it is 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.949
 vodka on that spot increased with a very good game but 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.790
 I also could not play each other a few nights even though it was still good 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.469
 finds 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.269
 you can actually do that yourself, I can't play any game any longer than 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.159
 2 3 consecutive hours because it just gets bored unless it's a whole 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.729
 good single player game is then that I really get sucked into the story then 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.620
 can play places for a game 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 true multiplayer games that I can no longer play per card 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.729
 they don't 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.749
 we regret that it is just the case 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.999
 if you then immediately find yourself again that will be ellen damme 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.009
 2 or not 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 but also not immediately know 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.650
 what you went the nicest body this morning 2 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.169
 because I once suffered a deep wound every year a while back then the ban 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.240
 on cracking and met and as best logical because 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.809
 this one to that is very open 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:41.599
 you have a hiding place for five years when the ball flies up, for this it is such 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.660
 bit all burglaries in with the coverage search 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.319
 he has the region's bumpers name 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.909
 that is the coverage that is on top of the bus 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.789
 if you have clearer scenarios, always have neighborhoods 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 I can pulled that easiest afterwards, it seemed that they could 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.329
 Sure made very easy rails on site because they are incredible 

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:03.359
 is open and at the moment I am just waiting for the chief Harry Reid 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.870
 jelte kill makes market 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.160
 he does not do it so I would also hit the shed there later so stayed there 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.569
 wk were left over 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.909
 fortunately because on a turnover of the band and of course 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:16.939
 and 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.499
 but other mercer such as tim curl skipper on that well done 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:22.820
 full year 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.210
 however, that is in the 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.810
 that very many buildings and everything and there is just by making or few on one 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.349
 space where turn 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.529
 two places 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.900
 who here are the top but fat of people who can't today 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.680
 most people enter the building right away, so you just can't do anything 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 implement a rate or mexico 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.999
 on some may last year the news started getting picked up 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.520
 it is still unclear what the games are 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.990
 recently it ad you occasionally comes 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.180
 things like that get naturally because 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.389
 the teenager is 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.620
 often not the very best because of the ice 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.879
 register now 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.240
 sco study single malts to buy a smart number of people 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.469
 then not everyone can be good so to get them things against me 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.240
 I think it's my own pace to play with him 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.669
 and 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.719
 driver's license is of course a very familiar one with is also a lot of fun to play 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.139
 that is just nice and well put together 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.659
 and 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.550
 she always became his companion 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.449
 who own the home the elysée 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.949
 you just passed that you are very much looking forward to being just one 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.139
 little then you should do that 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.699
 have the things that make people change tomorrow morning and that has 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.270
 the right to criticize her lawyer's new version 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.520
 because who was there is now assumed by Allah 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.960
 4 I call my securities conduct in the second round 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.259
 the PC so I already liked the late reaction 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.000
 with what you of the number five in a bus in the neighborhood the nicest blows lungs 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.969
 find two 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.449
 and then I'd say do it if you liked it 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.879
 and don't forget to subscribe me for more buys, he does that a lot 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.539
 and my chance with a negative message I naturally hope to have such a year 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.319
 then of course I will see you next time
