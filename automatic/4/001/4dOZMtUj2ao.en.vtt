00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.440
 [Music] 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.820
 let's review the analgesia technique 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.160
 epidural in an optic patient before 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.250
 begin we should have our team 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.610
 ready that should consist of gloves 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.880
 sterile syringes for infiltration that 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.240
 have for loss resistance needle of 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.690
 ptuj and local anesthetics catheter 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.809
 epidural and antiseptic 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.809
 [Music] 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.400
 we proceed to perform asepsis and 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.250
 antisepsis in the area where we are going to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.390
 work that in this case is the region 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.700
 lumbar of our patient 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.700
 [Music] 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.720
 to orient ourselves spatially we are going to 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.690
 draw an imaginary line that links the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 two iliac crests will correspond to the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:13.120
 intervertebral space l4 you tape 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:15.760
 [Music] 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.730
 we infiltrate local anesthetic in the 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.650
 chosen intervertebral space until 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.650
 a cutaneous fertilizer is sketched 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.890
 we proceed to prepare the mixture 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.649
 anesthetic 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.770
 in this case it consists of video to cain to 15 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.470
 milligrams plus 50 micrograms of 30,000 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.079
 in a total volume of 12 centimeters 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.960
 public filled with saline 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.200
 normal to have a concentration of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.110
 search zero point chain 125 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.990
 one hundred and four micrograms of fentanyl per 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.990
 cubic centimeter an analgesic dose 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.139
 [Music] 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.840
 we perform the position with the needle 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.400
 Turin in the selected space once 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.000
 we are in the ligaments 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.330
 thorny interest we started to realize 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.160
 the loss of resistance test in 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:30.530
 this case with air 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:33.340
 [Music] 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.660
 and identify the epidural space 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.660
 we will proceed to insert the catheter 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:03:04.540
 [Music] 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.220
 finally we administer the mixture 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:23.059
 anesthetic through the catheter and fix it 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:23.059
