00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.040
 space sport turned into 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.030
 the original version is somewhat cut out 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 because it does not allow to commit 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 landing on numerous 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.239
 the planets that came the ship itself 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.869
 it depends on the dirty tricks even to blow 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.799
 a planet but would like some more 

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:25.999
 operative something to communicate with the inhabitants 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.899
 well, or at least from if their matches which 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.849
 face to face 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.930
 In general, for this addition was deprived

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.520
 Adventure 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.320
 which allows us to finally sit down 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.250
 planets do things there now 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.680
 you can only own 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.520
 spaceship but also actually 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.489
 captain drivers can dismiss 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.850
 ionic planets he comes up with this 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 assignment if his 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670
 Attempts after finishing successful will receive 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.970
 Special points to develop level 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.370
 and getting a level will be able to wear again 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.260
 on yourself all sorts of useful things that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.720
 will be 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.540
 give them some kind of attraction that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.660
 I can leave 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.230
 but better to communicate with others 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.010
 why you can choose it yourself 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.440
 adventures so many cookies 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.550
 actually building but the house itself you also 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.500
 You can subscribe to it on the Internet. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280
 broadcast to let them slip between who 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.560
 will not appear 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.590
 and you can do iksanov actually a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560
 here most of the broadcast just 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 it is user 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 content that is made the same 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 enthusiasts what if you of course 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.170
 enthusiast in general, the editor himself about a lot 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.720
 simple enough true that simpler than 900 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.750
 there is no 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.420
 Ie now in the first to him can be 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480
 connect something that we have created that 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.710
 old dispute ie traitor creatures 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 Denmark mechanisms 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 create such simple rules by which 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.399
 they will live 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.359
 give you some goals you need 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.799
 perform to get married in the liver 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.520
 success and in your own abilities 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.430
 that is, it can be, but you go deeper 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.110
 he replied that heaped up and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.500
 quick punks rushes to live in 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.440
 boarding schools 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.210
 and after all on all forms look what 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.989
 section 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.840
 as you already know with purpose even before the release 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.669
 galaxy adventures 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.929
 Natsik from the parapet and was posted 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.720
 several million creations 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 their number is just July 7 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.869
 in steps 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.079
 inclusion is a frequent situation then is there 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.689
 a lot of principle 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.540
 many good enough mouth but to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.799
 Unfortunately, the engine allows you to do everything 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.739
 anything but it works 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.749
 sometimes not the way you want everything is 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.129
 very often see if Lipetsk this 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.390
 challenging edition 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.410

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.440
 get stuck in a movie can give no 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.180
 problems n 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.189
 moving to one point or another 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.299
 all this is of course treated by testing 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.009
 MKAD of you so strange 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.559
 electronics price permanent gives 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:54.729
 recent fans released 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.249
 allowing turn of river creation to her 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.529
 there is on machines really not inside 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.219
 arenas home in general even we enjoy it 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.269
 can be called a kind of game but even if 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.109
 you yourself turn is not going to 100 per hour 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.479
 there is very 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.629
 yes there are so many adventures many of 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.349
 they are qualitative in many different genres and 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.719
 some there are allowed based on 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.639
 popular there serials lay on 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.089
 conifers there are less popular which 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.329
 some books like write based on 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.119
 Alice in Wonderland in turn second 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.219
 completely holistic adventure cut off 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.219
 Chechens compared to 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.449
 m user missions don't even 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.119
 fixed and watching that i 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.449
 quite a long time and developer 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.059
 done at school 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.769
 players new we hope that in the end 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.839
 meeting such players for sale 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:43.169
 maxim be something to learn
