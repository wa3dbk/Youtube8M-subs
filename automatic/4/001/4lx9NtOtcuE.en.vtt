00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that this is definitely not the hottest

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
that this is definitely not the hottest
that<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.400> hair<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.700> pretty

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that it can go but my hair is pretty

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
that it can go but my hair is pretty
thin<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.240> fragile<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.890> use

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
thin and fragile so I don't want to use
