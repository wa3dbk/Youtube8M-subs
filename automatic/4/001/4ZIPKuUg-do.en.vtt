00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
up your IP address and see where it's

you<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.649> why<00:00:43.800> people<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.309> try<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you and this is why people will try and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
you and this is why people will try and
use<00:00:44.879> proxies<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.870> proxies<00:00:46.350> are

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
use proxies because proxies are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
use proxies because proxies are
basically<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> server<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> sits<00:00:48.270> between<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
basically a server that sits between you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
basically a server that sits between you
and<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> website<00:00:49.559> you're<00:00:49.710> visiting<00:00:49.739> hide

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and the website you're visiting hide

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.779 
and the website you're visiting hide
your<00:00:50.940> real<00:00:51.090> location<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> website<00:00:53.520> only

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
your real location and the website only

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.410 
your real location and the website only
sees<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.780> IP<00:00:55.110> address<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> proxy<00:00:56.010> server

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
sees the IP address of the proxy server

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
sees the IP address of the proxy server
so<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.140> using<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.590> British<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.190> uk-based

well the simple answer is yes you can do

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
well the simple answer is yes you can do
this<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.100> free<00:01:14.600> but<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> few

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this for free but there are a few

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
this for free but there are a few
drawbacks<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.689> now<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> use

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
drawbacks to it now if you want to use

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.749 
drawbacks to it now if you want to use
free<00:01:19.860> proxies<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.820> main<00:01:21.659> drawbacks<00:01:22.140> are

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
free proxies the main drawbacks are

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.980 
free proxies the main drawbacks are
speed<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> reliability<00:01:25.580> speed<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.420> most

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
speed and reliability speed is that most

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.429 
speed and reliability speed is that most
of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> free<00:01:28.350> ones<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:29.100> overloaded<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
of the free ones are very overloaded and

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.780 
of the free ones are very overloaded and
so<00:01:31.439> they're<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.040> capable<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so they're not really capable of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.960 
so they're not really capable of
streaming<00:01:33.119> video<00:01:33.509> across<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.820> will

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
streaming video across it you you will

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.120 
streaming video across it you you will
occasionally<00:01:36.390> find<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
occasionally find one that is for a

occasionally find one that is for a
short<00:01:38.369> time<00:01:38.930> reliability<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.740> fall<00:01:40.950> over

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
short time reliability is they fall over

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
short time reliability is they fall over
all<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> time<00:01:42.290> my<00:01:43.290> record<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.920> something

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.850 
they've got a list here
proxy's<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.870> they'll<00:02:14.080> actually<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> list

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
I played have to look down the list and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.470 
I played have to look down the list and
try<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.500> find<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:06.160> British<00:03:06.879> one<00:03:09.209> they<00:03:10.209> change

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.620 
browsing isn't working go in and and
take<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.410> out<00:04:41.560> because<00:04:41.889> as<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.400> say<00:04:42.610> using<00:04:43.270> free

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
take it out because as I say using free

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.580 
take it out because as I say using free
proxies<00:04:44.110> they<00:04:44.350> won't<00:04:44.530> last<00:04:44.740> very<00:04:44.889> long<00:04:45.250> okay

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
proxies they won't last very long okay

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.070 
proxies they won't last very long okay
but<00:04:47.590> that's<00:04:47.740> how<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:47.949> do<00:04:48.130> free<00:04:48.340> proxies<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:49.120> it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
but that's how you do free proxies so it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.230 
but that's how you do free proxies so it
can<00:04:50.290> be<00:04:50.440> for<00:04:50.650> some<00:04:50.830> people<00:04:51.160> it's<00:04:51.820> quite

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
can be for some people it's quite

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.260 
can be for some people it's quite
time-consuming<00:04:53.130> be<00:04:54.130> careful<00:04:54.520> as<00:04:54.639> well<00:04:54.820> on<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
time-consuming be careful as well on the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.800 
time-consuming be careful as well on the
security<00:04:55.720> aspect<00:04:56.110> because<00:04:57.030> there<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.690> don't

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
security aspect because there you don't

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.570 
security aspect because there you don't
know<00:04:58.960> who<00:04:59.080> runs<00:04:59.289> these<00:04:59.530> proxies<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.250> some

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
know who runs these proxies and some

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.390 
know who runs these proxies and some
hackers<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.590> identity<00:05:02.590> thieves<00:05:02.710> can<00:05:03.010> use<00:05:03.220> and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
hackers and identity thieves can use and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.980 
hackers and identity thieves can use and
but<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.580> you're<00:05:03.699> just<00:05:03.789> using<00:05:04.150> them<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.510> watch

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990
