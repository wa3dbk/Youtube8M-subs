00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the resin and then we sprinkle seashells

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.480 
the resin and then we sprinkle seashells
in<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.960> when<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> light<00:01:30.380> shines<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:31.099> lights

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
in it so when the light shines it lights

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.339 
in it so when the light shines it lights
up<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.910> bottom<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:33.020> make<00:01:33.200> them

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:33.349 
up the bottom and then to make them

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.190 
up the bottom and then to make them
better<00:01:34.220> for<00:01:34.490> outdoors<00:01:34.910> we<00:01:35.360> use<00:01:35.569> a<00:01:35.599> glue<00:01:36.140> that

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
better for outdoors we use a glue that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.260 
better for outdoors we use a glue that
you<00:01:36.560> put<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.039> outside<00:01:37.429> when<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.819> hardens

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
you put on the outside when the hardens

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.109 
you put on the outside when the hardens
it<00:01:38.479> protects<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.990> fabric<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:40.490> always<00:01:40.580> helps<00:01:40.970> to

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
it protects a fabric it always helps to

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.210 
it protects a fabric it always helps to
have<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.270> extra<00:01:41.690> set<00:01:41.869> of<00:01:41.899> hands<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.560> when<00:01:43.099> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
have the extra set of hands so when the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.400 
have the extra set of hands so when the
glue<00:01:43.429> is<00:01:43.459> hot<00:01:43.759> I'll<00:01:43.940> go<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.390> help<00:01:45.050> stretch

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
glue is hot I'll go in and help stretch

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.139 
glue is hot I'll go in and help stretch
the<00:01:45.440> fabric<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.520> make<00:01:46.640> sure<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:46.910> on

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
the fabric just to make sure it's on
