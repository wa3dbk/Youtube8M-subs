00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
handle the concern of the undead bird
which<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> creatures<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
which is one of the creatures on the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
which is one of the creatures on the
board<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.960> things<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.500> going

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
board so there are things that are going

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.849 
board so there are things that are going
to<00:00:55.680> drive<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:57.030> Jack<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> Bruce<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.620> going

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to drive what Jack and Bruce are going

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.450 
to drive what Jack and Bruce are going
to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.190> it<00:01:00.059> turns<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.199> Bruce<00:01:01.680> has<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to do it turns out that Bruce has the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.469 
to do it turns out that Bruce has the
ability<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> share<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.260> take<00:01:05.030> action<00:01:06.030> points

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
ability to share or take action points

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.800 
ability to share or take action points
so<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.280> three<00:01:08.760> action<00:01:09.119> points<00:01:09.570> each

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so we have three action points each

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420 
so we have three action points each
because<00:01:10.530> neither<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.130> characters

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
because neither one of these characters

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.570 
because neither one of these characters
have<00:01:11.850> taken<00:01:12.270> any<00:01:12.510> damage<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.830> basically

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
have taken any damage so we basically

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
have taken any damage so we basically
are<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.420> thinking<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
are going to be thinking about what can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.550 
are going to be thinking about what can
we<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.400> six<00:01:17.700> action<00:01:18.150> points<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:19.200> both

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
we do with six action points they both

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.370 
we do with six action points they both
in<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.340> case<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.820> handguns<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
in this case have handguns which have a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.429 
in this case have handguns which have a
range<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.150> they're<00:01:24.600> able<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> shoot

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
range of one so they're able to shoot

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
range of one so they're able to shoot
into<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> room<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> they

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
into this room if they want to they

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
into this room if they want to they
could<00:01:28.080> step<00:01:28.439> forward<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.310> shoot<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
could step forward and shoot at the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840 
could step forward and shoot at the
undead<00:01:30.750> bird<00:01:31.220> important<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> recognize

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
undead bird important to recognize

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
undead bird important to recognize
though<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.180> they<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.900> wind<00:01:34.110> up

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
though that they actually wind up

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.910

the undead burg and in fact slow it down

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.270 
the undead burg and in fact slow it down
that's<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> things<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.320> do<00:02:13.560> when

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
that's one of the things you can do when

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.860 
that's one of the things you can do when
you<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.550> damage<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.030> creatures<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.690> can

you do damage the creatures you can

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.550 
you do damage the creatures you can
target<00:02:16.110> its<00:02:16.440> movement<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.270> as<00:02:18.630> they're

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
target its movement so as they're

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.960 
target its movement so as they're
deciding<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.370> they're<00:02:20.520> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> do

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
deciding what they're going to do

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.060 
deciding what they're going to do
they've<00:02:21.540> got<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> couple<00:02:22.110> different<00:02:22.650> options

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
they've got a couple different options

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.310 
they've got a couple different options
in<00:02:24.030> front<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.420> them<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> be

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
in front of them and it's going to be

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.820 
in front of them and it's going to be
driven<00:02:25.620> by<00:02:26.720> results<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> attack<00:02:28.230> die<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
driven by results on the attack die and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.720 
driven by results on the attack die and
the<00:02:28.950> equipment<00:02:29.430> they<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.900> also<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.730> we

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the equipment they have we also have we

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.720 
the equipment they have we also have we
mentioned<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.660> Nina<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.530> Leo<00:02:35.250> are

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
mentioned that Nina and Leo are

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
mentioned that Nina and Leo are
entrapped<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.810> they're<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> room<00:02:37.560> with

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
entrapped so they're in a room with

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.850 
entrapped so they're in a room with
zombies<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:39.510> zombies<00:02:39.540> during<00:02:40.200> their<00:02:40.440> attacks

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
zombies the zombies during their attacks

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.660 
zombies the zombies during their attacks
have<00:02:41.070> rolled<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.000> trap<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:43.170> mean<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.400> their

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
have rolled in a trap I mean on their

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.570 
have rolled in a trap I mean on their
attack<00:02:44.970> dice<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.260> what<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.500> means<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
attack dice and so what that means is is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.930 
attack dice and so what that means is is
that<00:02:48.480> Nina<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.200> Leo<00:02:49.470> aren't<00:02:50.070> able<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.760> do

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that Nina and Leo aren't able to do

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.479 
that Nina and Leo aren't able to do
anything<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.510> try<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.020> get<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:53.190> being

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
anything but try and get out from being

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.400 
anything but try and get out from being
in<00:02:53.670> traps<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.150> they<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.450> roll<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> single<00:02:55.110> die

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
in traps so they can roll a single die

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.180 
in traps so they can roll a single die
and<00:02:55.860> try<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.700> get<00:02:56.910> an<00:02:57.810> escape<00:02:58.260> or<00:02:58.470> move<00:02:58.650> icon

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
and try and get an escape or move icon

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.729 
and try and get an escape or move icon
so<00:02:59.790> they're<00:03:00.269> pinned<00:03:01.370> pretty<00:03:02.370> badly<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:03.120> now

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
so they're pinned pretty badly right now

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.110 
so they're pinned pretty badly right now
party<00:03:04.739> members<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.250> come<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.850> try<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
party members can come in and try and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.259 
party members can come in and try and
assist<00:03:06.570> them<00:03:06.930> or<00:03:07.860> if<00:03:08.459> all<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.820> creatures<00:03:09.239> in

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
assist them or if all the creatures in

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.759 
assist them or if all the creatures in
the<00:03:09.540> room<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.900> been<00:03:09.930> killed<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.500> again

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
the room have been killed but again

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.400 
the room have been killed but again
because<00:03:10.980> they're<00:03:11.430> entrapped<00:03:11.970> they<00:03:12.810> cannot<00:03:13.200> do

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
because they're entrapped they cannot do

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.750 
because they're entrapped they cannot do
any<00:03:13.590> attacking<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.340> they're<00:03:14.489> going<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> need

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
any attacking so they're going to need

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.150 
any attacking so they're going to need
outside<00:03:15.360> assistance<00:03:15.630> unless<00:03:16.410> they<00:03:16.769> get<00:03:16.980> lucky

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
outside assistance unless they get lucky

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.900 
outside assistance unless they get lucky
and<00:03:17.489> roll<00:03:17.640> their<00:03:17.760> dice<00:03:19.370> we<00:03:20.370> also<00:03:20.580> have<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and roll their dice we also have the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.789 
and roll their dice we also have the
situation<00:03:21.120> with<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> undead<00:03:22.140> bird<00:03:22.440> creature

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
situation with the undead bird creature

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.190 
situation with the undead bird creature
on<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.250> board<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:24.450> thing<00:03:24.690> about<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
on the board the thing about the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860 
on the board the thing about the
creatures<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.250> whenever<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.360> board

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
creatures is that whenever the board

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720 
creatures is that whenever the board
triggers<00:03:28.290> movement<00:03:28.830> whenever<00:03:29.130> characters

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
triggers movement whenever characters

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.900 
triggers movement whenever characters
finish<00:03:30.180> their<00:03:30.540> turn<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.739> creatures<00:03:32.549> then

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
finish their turn the creatures then

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.330 
finish their turn the creatures then
start<00:03:33.360> moving<00:03:33.810> toward<00:03:34.080> them<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.769> are<00:03:35.040> at

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
start moving toward them so we are at

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.400 
start moving toward them so we are at
risk<00:03:35.700> from<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.239> bird<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.200> has<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
risk from the bird because it has a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.520 
risk from the bird because it has a
movement<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.310> three<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.140> we've<00:03:40.140> got<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
movement of three and we've got one

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.380 
movement of three and we've got one
party<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.010> two<00:03:41.280> spaces<00:03:41.580> away<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.150> another

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
party that's two spaces away and another

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.140 
party that's two spaces away and another
party<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:43.049> three<00:03:43.380> spaces<00:03:43.709> away<00:03:44.150> what

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
party that's three spaces away what

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.990 
party that's three spaces away what
triggers<00:03:45.810> movement<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.680> when<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.340> particular

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
triggers movement is when a particular

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.650 
triggers movement is when a particular
group<00:03:48.299> has<00:03:48.630> completed<00:03:49.230> their<00:03:49.530> turn<00:03:50.660> their

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
group has completed their turn their

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.229 
group has completed their turn their
pieces<00:03:52.290> will<00:03:52.500> slide<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.489> multi

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
pieces will slide down on the multi

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.289 
pieces will slide down on the multi
tracker<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.769> triggers<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.700> reaction

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
tracker and that triggers the reaction

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.949 
tracker and that triggers the reaction
from<00:03:57.660> either<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.380> zombies<00:03:59.000> the<00:04:00.000> zombies<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
from either the zombies the zombies and

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.380 
from either the zombies the zombies and
the<00:04:01.350> creature<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.760> something<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.269> be

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the creature so it's something to be

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.510 
the creature so it's something to be
aware<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.989> need<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.440> cognizant<00:04:05.160> of

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
aware of we need to be cognizant of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.160 
aware of we need to be cognizant of
where<00:04:06.180> our<00:04:06.390> team<00:04:06.690> finished

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
where our team finished

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.530 
where our team finished
is<00:04:07.260> up<00:04:07.470> because<00:04:07.950> wherever<00:04:08.130> they<00:04:08.550> stop<00:04:09.000> that

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
is up because wherever they stop that

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.900 
is up because wherever they stop that
room<00:04:10.050> basically<00:04:10.500> becomes<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.430> triggering
