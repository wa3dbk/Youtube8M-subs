00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.090 
going to make it a little hard to
consume<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:42.030> consistency<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.620> try

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
consume the consistency of it so try

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
consume the consistency of it so try
crushing<00:02:44.610> them<00:02:44.760> along<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> way<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:45.900> put

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
crushing them along the way and then put

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.580 
crushing them along the way and then put
me<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.800> some<00:02:47.070> Phi<00:02:47.630> which<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.840> Greek<00:02:49.170> yogurt

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
me on some Phi which is the Greek yogurt

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.090 
me on some Phi which is the Greek yogurt
and<00:02:49.890> some<00:02:50.220> honey<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.330> should<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.630> good<00:02:51.840> um

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and some honey and you should be good um

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.470 
and some honey and you should be good um
so<00:02:53.100> that's<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> only<00:02:53.459> up<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.209> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
so that's the only up and I have a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.790 
so that's the only up and I have a
siphon<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.380> link<00:02:55.890> chunk<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.959> let's<00:02:57.959> get<00:02:58.410> right

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
siphon the link chunk so let's get right

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.570 
siphon the link chunk so let's get right
to<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
to it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.990 
to it
okay<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> my<00:03:01.380> has<00:03:01.620> grown<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> lot<00:03:01.980> um<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.880> already

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
okay so my has grown a lot um I already

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.420 
okay so my has grown a lot um I already
sleep<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.200> took<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> brush<00:03:04.860> took<00:03:05.220> some

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
sleep it and took a brush took some

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.810 
sleep it and took a brush took some
measurements<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.209> um<00:03:06.510> window<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.530> guys

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
measurements but um window for you guys

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.250 
measurements but um window for you guys
so<00:03:09.170> I'll<00:03:10.170> start<00:03:10.590> with<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.860> size<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.700> last

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
so I'll start with the size the last

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
so I'll start with the size the last
month<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.950> most<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.430> have<00:03:14.610> three<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.299> half

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
month the most I have three and a half

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
month the most I have three and a half
so<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:18.209> certain<00:03:18.600> parts<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.930> my<00:03:18.989> hair<00:03:19.320> is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so because certain parts of my hair is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.199 
so because certain parts of my hair is
always<00:03:19.769> shorter<00:03:20.370> than<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.640> rest<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.180> don't

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
always shorter than the rest I don't

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.660 
always shorter than the rest I don't
know<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> guys<00:03:21.810> remember<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:25.670> we're

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
know if you guys remember that so we're

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.240 
know if you guys remember that so we're
you<00:03:26.850> sure<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> guys<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.660> please<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.950> going

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you sure you guys can please it's going

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.190 
you sure you guys can please it's going
on<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.549> when<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> hair<00:03:30.000> snaps<00:03:30.299> back<00:03:30.600> that's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
on so when the hair snaps back that's

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.840 
on so when the hair snaps back that's
what<00:03:31.380> I'll<00:03:31.500> stop<00:03:31.829> measuring<00:03:33.440> okay<00:03:34.850> consider

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
what I'll stop measuring okay consider

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.920 
what I'll stop measuring okay consider
again<00:03:37.040> what<00:03:38.040> it's<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:38.790> when<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.299> checked<00:03:39.690> it

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
again what it's for when I checked it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.500 
again what it's for when I checked it
before<00:03:40.200> when<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.769> checked<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.160> last<00:03:41.489> time

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:58.970 

yep<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.860> that's<00:03:48.099> four<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.370> guys<00:03:54.610> can<00:03:54.909> see

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.210 

three<00:03:59.980> seven<00:04:00.519> five<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.390> believe<00:04:01.840> that's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
three seven five so I believe that's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.520 
three seven five so I believe that's
typically<00:04:03.220> where<00:04:03.640> my<00:04:04.060> own<00:04:04.299> hair<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.900> short<00:04:05.349> it

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
typically where my own hair is short it

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.979 
typically where my own hair is short it
will<00:04:05.650> bat<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.250> middle<00:04:06.519> my<00:04:07.239> hair<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.629> short

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
will bat in the middle my hair is short

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.900 
will bat in the middle my hair is short
affecting<00:04:08.470> around<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:09.010> cuz<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.220> did<00:04:09.400> my<00:04:09.519> own<00:04:09.700> big

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
affecting around it cuz I did my own big

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.699 
affecting around it cuz I did my own big
chop<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.480> got<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> little<00:04:10.930> excited<00:04:11.379> or

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.200 

375<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:03.380> last<00:05:04.010> month<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:04.790> ranged<00:05:05.419> from<00:05:07.120> doing<00:05:08.120> a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
375 so last month it ranged from doing a

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.560 
375 so last month it ranged from doing a
quote<00:05:08.450> three<00:05:08.870> mm<00:05:09.860> -<00:05:10.100> now<00:05:10.550> it's<00:05:12.100> 375<00:05:13.100> about<00:05:14.000> -

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
quote three mm - now it's 375 about -

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.280 
quote three mm - now it's 375 about -
four<00:05:14.810> inches

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
four inches

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.280 
four inches
um<00:05:15.820> most<00:05:16.820> places<00:05:17.090> online<00:05:17.450> here<00:05:17.660> is<00:05:17.930> four

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
um most places online here is four

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.230 
um most places online here is four
inches<00:05:18.500> except<00:05:19.130> in<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.400> middle<00:05:19.639> part<00:05:19.910> and

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
inches except in the middle part and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.500 
inches except in the middle part and
like<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:21.290> hard<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.770> side<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:22.760> most<00:05:23.240> of

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
like so hard to the side but most of

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.960 
like so hard to the side but most of
everywhere<00:05:23.960> else<00:05:24.139> is<00:05:24.380> four<00:05:24.620> inches<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.460> it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
everywhere else is four inches so it

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.350 
everywhere else is four inches so it
looks<00:05:26.360> like<00:05:26.570> my<00:05:27.530> hair<00:05:27.740> steadily<00:05:28.430> is<00:05:28.910> going<00:05:29.240> out
