for the gem to list and for gem too so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.960 
for the gem to list and for gem too so
just<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.910> place<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> gem<00:01:00.449> ones<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.840> gem<00:01:01.020> twos

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.899 

alright<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.470> look<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.890> our<00:01:08.189> list<00:01:08.549> now

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
alright so we can look at our list now

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.190 
alright so we can look at our list now
that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:11.000> gem<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:15.200> we

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that we get out of this gem one and we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.359 
that we get out of this gem one and we
just<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.040> actually

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
just want to see if it's actually

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
just want to see if it's actually
picking<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:18.740> matches<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:20.299> if<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.450> adding

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
picking up matches or if it's adding

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
picking up matches or if it's adding
gems<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.619> match<00:01:23.250> list<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:30.000> move<00:01:30.180> this

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
gems to the match list so we move this

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.810 
gems to the match list so we move this
to<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:32.689> picks<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.810> five

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
to here picks up five

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
to here picks up five
which<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.890> alright<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.310> probably

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
which is alright because it's probably

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.399 
which is alright because it's probably
going<00:01:38.789> you're<00:01:39.359> here<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.380> here

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
going you're here here here and here

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.359 
going you're here here here and here
which<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> problems<00:01:44.189> we're<00:01:44.310> gonna

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
which is one of the problems we're gonna

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
which is one of the problems we're gonna
have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> fix<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.750> picking<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.200> gems

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
have to fix so it's picking up the gems

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.249 
have to fix so it's picking up the gems
but<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.859> need<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> fix<00:01:47.399> our<00:01:47.579> list<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.810> it's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
but we need to fix our list because it's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
but we need to fix our list because it's
not<00:01:49.819> proper<00:01:50.819> yet<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.759> need<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.119> make<00:01:54.959> a<00:01:55.020> new

function called fix match list and what

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.270 
function called fix match list and what
this<00:02:03.929> is<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.859> it's<00:02:05.099> going<00:02:05.219> to

take a list of gems list to fix and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.809 
take a list of gems list to fix and
we're<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.849> go<00:02:18.030> ahead<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> call<00:02:18.629> this

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
we're going to go ahead and call this

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:28.580 
we're going to go ahead and call this
our<00:02:21.590> thanks<00:02:22.590> match<00:02:22.860> list<00:02:23.780> Jim<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:27.379> gem<00:02:28.379> one

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
our thanks match list Jim one gem one

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:42.699 
our thanks match list Jim one gem one
list<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.500> same<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:31.769> gem<00:02:32.190> too

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.280 

all<00:02:43.709> right<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.900> separate

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
all right so in here we need to separate

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.819 
all right so in here we need to separate
our<00:02:46.560> list<00:02:47.010> into<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:47.940> different<00:02:48.120> lists<00:02:48.829> we

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
our list into two different lists we

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.339 
our list into two different lists we
need<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> make<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> list<00:02:50.669> of<00:02:50.819> rows<00:02:53.419> and<00:02:54.419> a<00:02:55.019> list

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
need to make a list of rows and a list

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:07.009 
need to make a list of rows and a list
of<00:02:55.849> columns<00:03:03.169> and<00:03:05.419> the<00:03:06.419> way<00:03:06.540> we're<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.810> do

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
of columns and the way we're going to do

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.240 
of columns and the way we're going to do
this<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.500> we're<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.799> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.069> loop

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
this is that we're just going to loop

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.409 
this is that we're just going to loop
through<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.700> list<00:03:10.310> my<00:03:11.310> less<00:03:11.609> than<00:03:11.639> list<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
through this list my less than list to

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.559 
through this list my less than list to
count<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:18.060> we're<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> loop<00:03:18.540> through

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
count so we're going to loop through

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.330 
count so we're going to loop through
this<00:03:18.840> list<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.380> then<00:03:19.620> we're<00:03:19.829> going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.069> say

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
this list and then we're going to say

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.559 
this list and then we're going to say
that<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:21.530> our<00:03:22.530> gem<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.010> we're<00:03:23.130> passing<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.730> x

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
that if our gem that we're passing in x

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.850 
that if our gem that we're passing in x
squared<00:03:25.669> equals<00:03:26.669> our

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
squared equals our

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.220 
squared equals our

it's<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> column<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.170> we're<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
it's in a column and so we're going to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:05.560 
it's in a column and so we're going to
add<00:03:52.560> those<00:03:54.080> ad<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:59.030> and<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.420> column<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:03.120> had

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.270 

this<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.810> fix<00:04:07.020> sub<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:09.230> alright<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.650> now<00:04:11.160> we're

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
this to fix sub I alright so now we're

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.720 
this to fix sub I alright so now we're
going<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.430> separate<00:04:11.880> out<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.860> rows<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
going to separate out the rows and the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.060 
going to separate out the rows and the
columns<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.450> now<00:04:16.260> we<00:04:16.320> need<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.560> check<00:04:16.859> if

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
columns and now we need to check if

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.849 
columns and now we need to check if
these<00:04:17.310> rows<00:04:17.579> are<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:18.060> fact<00:04:18.269> matches<00:04:18.859> because

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
these rows are in fact matches because

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.740 
these rows are in fact matches because
if<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.250> only<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.760> only<00:04:20.910> matching<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.540> Lu

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
if it's only it's only matching to Lu

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.780 
if it's only it's only matching to Lu
then<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.560> match<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.280> only<00:04:23.400> matching

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
then it's not a match it's only matching

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.180 
then it's not a match it's only matching
one<00:04:24.080> or<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:25.710> matching<00:04:25.860> three

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
one or you know if it's matching three

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.190 
one or you know if it's matching three
or<00:04:26.340> more<00:04:26.550> than<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:26.910> is

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
or more than it is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.520 
or more than it is
so<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:30.950> rows<00:04:32.090> count<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.720> greater<00:04:34.229> than<00:04:34.380> or

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
so if rows count is greater than or

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:44.380 
so if rows count is greater than or
equal<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.950> our<00:04:36.260> amount<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.710> match<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:41.220> if

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.969 

columns<00:04:45.390> taught<00:04:47.840> count<00:04:48.840> greater<00:04:49.710> than<00:04:49.890> or

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
columns taught count greater than or

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.600 
columns taught count greater than or
equal<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.430> amount<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:51.450> match<00:04:53.630> then<00:04:55.010> we<00:04:56.010> need<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
equal to amount to match then we need a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.980 
equal to amount to match then we need a
flag<00:04:58.729> public<00:04:59.729> or<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:01.050> matched<00:05:02.570> I'm<00:05:03.570> gonna<00:05:03.810> say

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
flag public or is matched I'm gonna say

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.110 
flag public or is matched I'm gonna say
false<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:06.740> here<00:05:07.740> I'm<00:05:07.950> gonna<00:05:08.070> say<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.700> matched

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
false and here I'm gonna say is matched

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.870 
false and here I'm gonna say is matched
is<00:05:10.280> true<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.830> same<00:05:14.160> thing<00:05:14.370> here<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.550> then<00:05:17.700> we

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
is true and same thing here and then we

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.010 
is true and same thing here and then we
need<00:05:17.910> two<00:05:18.360> more<00:05:18.900> bowls<00:05:19.590> in<00:05:19.830> here<00:05:21.140> Rose<00:05:22.140> matched

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
need two more bowls in here Rose matched

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.920 
need two more bowls in here Rose matched
set<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.140> to<00:05:25.290> false

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.760 

columns<00:05:28.560> matched<00:05:29.810> then<00:05:30.810> set<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.199> false<00:05:31.470> and

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
columns matched then set it to false and

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.260 
columns matched then set it to false and
we're<00:05:31.860> going<00:05:31.979> to<00:05:32.040> use<00:05:32.190> these<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.759> determine

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
we're going to use these to determine

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.110 
we're going to use these to determine
whether<00:05:34.259> or<00:05:34.410> not<00:05:34.530> we<00:05:35.100> matched<00:05:35.430> our<00:05:35.729> rows<00:05:35.910> or

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
whether or not we matched our rows or

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.490 
whether or not we matched our rows or
columns<00:05:37.639> so<00:05:38.639> we<00:05:39.180> could<00:05:39.419> just<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.930> guess<00:05:40.410> we

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
columns so we could just I guess we

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.870 
columns so we could just I guess we
could<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.740> it<00:05:40.830> here<00:05:41.190> too<00:05:42.289> so<00:05:43.289> make<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.220> slightly

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
could do it here too so make it slightly

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.870 
could do it here too so make it slightly
less<00:05:45.090> complicated<00:05:45.660> if<00:05:46.280> we<00:05:47.280> match<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.699> rows

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
less complicated if we match the rows

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:57.670 
less complicated if we match the rows
and<00:05:48.090> we<00:05:48.180> want<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.419> loop<00:05:48.600> through<00:05:50.600> our<00:05:51.600> rows<00:05:56.120> and

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
and we want to loop through our rows and

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.939 
and we want to loop through our rows and
if<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.949> remember<00:05:59.490> in<00:06:00.360> here<00:06:00.870> we<00:06:01.020> set<00:06:01.260> this<00:06:01.380> flag

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
if you remember in here we set this flag

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.010 
if you remember in here we set this flag
or<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.580> made<00:06:02.850> this<00:06:02.970> variable<00:06:03.539> called<00:06:03.840> is

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
or I made this variable called is

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.790 
or I made this variable called is
matched<00:06:05.030> so<00:06:06.030> all<00:06:06.210> we<00:06:06.330> want<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.539> do<00:06:06.630> now<00:06:06.810> is<00:06:07.199> say

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
matched so all we want to do now is say

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.500 
matched so all we want to do now is say
that<00:06:08.300> is<00:06:09.300> matched<00:06:09.690> it's<00:06:10.080> true<00:06:11.180> because<00:06:12.180> we're

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
that is matched it's true because we're

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.170 
that is matched it's true because we're
going<00:06:12.600> to<00:06:12.690> consider<00:06:12.990> this<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.289> match<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:14.430> then

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
going to consider this a match and then

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.610 
going to consider this a match and then
we<00:06:15.270> just<00:06:15.389> want<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.630> do<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.780> same<00:06:15.990> thing<00:06:16.289> here

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
we just want to do the same thing here

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.260 
we just want to do the same thing here
but<00:06:16.740> with<00:06:16.889> columns<00:06:19.580> so<00:06:20.580> you<00:06:20.639> can<00:06:20.760> just<00:06:20.910> copy<00:06:21.060> it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
but with columns so you can just copy it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.439 
but with columns so you can just copy it
over<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.630> then<00:06:21.720> replace<00:06:22.020> rows<00:06:22.260> with<00:06:22.410> columns

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
over and then replace rows with columns

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:31.969 
over and then replace rows with columns
and<00:06:24.560> at<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:25.800> point<00:06:26.630> we<00:06:27.630> can<00:06:27.840> now<00:06:30.830> go<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.860> our

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
and at this point we can now go to our

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.430 
and at this point we can now go to our
update<00:06:32.400> function
