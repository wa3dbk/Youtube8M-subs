00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
secondly I take a look at from the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.699 
secondly I take a look at from the
bottom<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.700> top<00:02:24.940> if<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:26.049> real<00:02:26.319> wide<00:02:26.530> at

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
bottom of the top if it's real wide at

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.410 
bottom of the top if it's real wide at
the<00:02:26.769> bottom<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.580> got<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.879> lean<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.209> thing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the bottom and I got to lean this thing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720 
the bottom and I got to lean this thing
up<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.590> flattens<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.129> when<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.459> get<00:02:30.610> up

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
up so that it flattens out when I get up

want the teeth to sink in so be kind of
choosing<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.599> tree<00:03:01.840> that's<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.230> first<00:03:02.470> thing

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
choosing a tree that's the first thing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.390 
choosing a tree that's the first thing
you<00:03:02.769> want<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.750> secondly<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:06.069> right<00:03:06.220> here

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
you want to do secondly this right here

so if something happens and this bottom
falls<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:13.420> doesn't<00:03:13.690> go<00:03:13.780> very<00:03:13.810> far<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.470> stays

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
falls it doesn't go very far it stays

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.210 
falls it doesn't go very far it stays
within<00:03:15.099> reach<00:03:15.660> very<00:03:16.660> very<00:03:17.349> very<00:03:17.680> important<00:03:18.160> to
