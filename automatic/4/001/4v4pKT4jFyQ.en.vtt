okay<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.129> tutorial<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.000> to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.789 
okay in this tutorial we're going to
learn<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.659> take<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.230> bitmap<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.400> trace<00:00:06.060> it

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
learn how to take a bitmap and trace it

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.140 
learn how to take a bitmap and trace it
automatically<00:00:07.799> using<00:00:08.519> flash<00:00:09.139> so<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:11.460> already

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
automatically using flash so I I already

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.640 
automatically using flash so I I already
have<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:13.110> my<00:00:13.139> library<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.040> character<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
have in my library this character that I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
have in my library this character that I
traced<00:00:17.510> manually<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> that's<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.630> good

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
traced manually and and that's all good

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
traced manually and and that's all good
and<00:00:22.320> well<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.180> instances<00:00:24.750> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and well but in in some instances you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
and well but in in some instances you
might<00:00:25.019> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.740> quicker

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
might want to go a little bit quicker

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.109 
might want to go a little bit quicker
and<00:00:26.510> you<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.720> need<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.250> detail<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and you don't need the detail that I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.370 
and you don't need the detail that I
have<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.140> particular<00:00:31.470> piece<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> art<00:00:33.380> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
have in this particular piece of art and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
have in this particular piece of art and
if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> detail

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
if you don't need that kind of detail

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
if you don't need that kind of detail
then<00:00:37.829> using<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> trace<00:00:38.640> bitmap<00:00:38.940> function<00:00:39.690> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
then using the trace bitmap function in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.639 
then using the trace bitmap function in
flash<00:00:40.140> might<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.460> solution<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> I'm

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
flash might be a good solution so I'm

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
flash might be a good solution so I'm
gonna<00:00:43.890> switch<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> Chrome<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.329> I've

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
gonna switch over to Chrome here I've

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
gonna switch over to Chrome here I've
already<00:00:45.930> searched<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> character<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
already searched for a character that I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360 
already searched for a character that I
want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.289> using<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.649> Google<00:00:50.039> image

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
want to get in using a Google image

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.170 
want to get in using a Google image
search<00:00:51.980> I'm<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.640> click<00:00:53.670> copy<00:00:54.570> image

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.670 
ahead and pause the video and grab one
more<00:01:09.799> character<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:11.100> Google<00:01:11.490> image<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
more character from Google image and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.780 
more character from Google image and
import<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> flesh<00:01:16.280> okay<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
import it in the flesh okay and I'm

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
import it in the flesh okay and I'm
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> assume<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.689> you've<00:01:18.990> already<00:01:19.200> done

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
going to assume that you've already done

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.590 
going to assume that you've already done
that<00:01:19.560> again<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.670> pause<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> video<00:01:21.540> here

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that again if not pause the video here

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
that again if not pause the video here
and<00:01:22.250> do<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.630> let's<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.380> gonna<00:01:25.530> zoom

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and do it but let's go on I'm gonna zoom

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
and do it but let's go on I'm gonna zoom
in<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.330> more

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
in here so you can see a little bit more

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.230 
in here so you can see a little bit more
detail<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> doing<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:30.119> gonna

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
detail with what this is doing I'm gonna

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.859 
detail with what this is doing I'm gonna
go<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> modify<00:01:31.140> menu<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
go up to the modify menu and go to the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.190 
go up to the modify menu and go to the
bitmap<00:01:34.759> menu<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.270> click<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> trace

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
bitmap menu and then click on trace

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.880 
bitmap menu and then click on trace
bitmap<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.750> then<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.930> click<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.229> preview<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
bitmap and then if I click on preview we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.940 
bitmap and then if I click on preview we
can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.460> doing<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
can see what it's doing so here if the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.010 
can see what it's doing so here if the
color<00:01:44.340> threshold<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> set<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.259> very<00:01:46.979> low

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
color threshold if you set it very low

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.069 
color threshold if you set it very low
you'll<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> lot<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:51.079> various

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you'll see that we get a lot of various

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.710 
you'll see that we get a lot of various
different<00:01:52.409> colors<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.970> fairly

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
different colors and it's fairly

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.980 
different colors and it's fairly
detailed<00:01:55.520> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.670> set<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:57.180> high<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
detailed if you set it very high than it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.749 
detailed if you set it very high than it
loses<00:01:58.740> detail<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.590> lot<00:02:01.590> easier<00:02:01.759> load

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
loses detail but it's a lot easier load

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.200 
loses detail but it's a lot easier load
for<00:02:03.270> Flash<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.899> bear<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:05.610> tend<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> find

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for Flash to bear and I tend to find

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.589 
for Flash to bear and I tend to find
that<00:02:06.390> somewhere<00:02:07.020> around<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.789> fifty<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that somewhere around the fifty to a

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.920 
that somewhere around the fifty to a
hundred<00:02:09.690> range<00:02:10.619> works<00:02:11.220> pretty<00:02:11.489> well

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
hundred range works pretty well

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.360 
hundred range works pretty well
and<00:02:13.019> then<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.640> same<00:02:14.849> thing<00:02:15.150> applies<00:02:15.719> with<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and then the same thing applies with the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.179 
and then the same thing applies with the
minimum<00:02:17.370> area<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.939> pixels<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.840> traced<00:02:19.200> if

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
minimum area of pixels to be traced if

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.690 
minimum area of pixels to be traced if
you<00:02:20.280> set<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.579> high<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you set that high then you are going to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.319 
you set that high then you are going to
get<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> less<00:02:24.150> detailed<00:02:24.750> version<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.209> you

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
get a less detailed version than if you

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.890 
get a less detailed version than if you
set<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.569> low<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.829> if<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.000> do<00:02:30.329> set<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.569> higher

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
set it low but if you do set it higher

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.509 
set it low but if you do set it higher
than<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.219> a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:34.260> bit<00:02:34.439> more<00:02:34.709> math<00:02:34.980> for

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
flash to have to do and we'll just leave

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080 
flash to have to do and we'll just leave
the<00:02:40.139> corner<00:02:40.469> threshold<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.159> corner<00:02:41.700> curve

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.500 
the corner threshold and corner curve
fit<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.659> normal<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.150> experiment

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
fit as normal and you can experiment

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.970

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
you can see all of those little points

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:37.159 
you can see all of those little points
that<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.829> has<00:03:29.040> created<00:03:34.669> okay<00:03:35.750> well<00:03:36.750> I'm<00:03:37.019> going

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
that it has created okay well I'm going

hit V I'm gonna get rid of this other

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.530 
hit V I'm gonna get rid of this other
character<00:03:43.829> that's<00:03:44.280> standing<00:03:44.729> beside<00:03:45.120> my<00:03:45.329> main

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
character that's standing beside my main

character get rid of that white space
around<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:50.430> character<00:03:50.939> even<00:03:51.569> gonna<00:03:51.840> get<00:03:51.959> rid

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
around the character even gonna get rid

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.449 
around the character even gonna get rid
of<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.259> shadow<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:54.540> I'm<00:03:54.659> going<00:03:54.870> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
of the shadow and then I'm going to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.819 
of the shadow and then I'm going to
highlight<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.609> character<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:58.290> click<00:03:58.650> on

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
highlight the character right click on

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:05.809 
highlight the character right click on
him<00:03:59.129> and<00:04:01.040> convert<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.310> symbol<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:05.519> I'm<00:04:05.669> just

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
him and convert to symbol and I'm just

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.680 
him and convert to symbol and I'm just
gonna<00:04:05.939> name<00:04:06.209> him<00:04:07.669> traced

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
gonna name him traced

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.770 
gonna name him traced
bitmap<00:04:13.040> okay<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.550> now<00:04:15.030> you'll<00:04:15.210> see<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.480> he's

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
bitmap okay and now you'll see that he's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.800 
bitmap okay and now you'll see that he's
showing<00:04:16.080> up<00:04:16.290> in<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.310> library<00:04:17.549> here<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:19.950> can

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
showing up in the library here so I can

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.930 
showing up in the library here so I can
drag<00:04:21.810> out<00:04:21.989> multiple<00:04:22.530> instances<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.610> this

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
drag out multiple instances of this

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.030 
drag out multiple instances of this
character<00:04:24.510> from<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.960> library<00:04:25.410> at<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.740> point

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
character from the library at this point

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.570 
character from the library at this point
and<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:27.840> what<00:04:28.050> ultimately<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:29.310> want<00:04:29.430> to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
and that's what ultimately you want to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.880 
and that's what ultimately you want to
be<00:04:29.700> able<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.350> now<00:04:31.350> I'm<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> delete

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
be able to do now I'm going to delete

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.260 
be able to do now I'm going to delete
him<00:04:32.010> from<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.850> stage<00:04:33.560> hit<00:04:34.560> save<00:04:34.860> again<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.270> I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
him from the stage hit save again and I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.260 
him from the stage hit save again and I
can<00:04:37.170> even<00:04:37.410> delete<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.040> bitmap<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:39.000> I'm<00:04:39.120> no

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
can even delete this bitmap if I'm no

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.290 
can even delete this bitmap if I'm no
longer<00:04:39.300> using<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:41.820> only<00:04:42.030> the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
longer using it and I have only the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.760 
longer using it and I have only the
trace<00:04:43.290> bitmap<00:04:44.030> vector<00:04:45.030> art<00:04:45.440> left<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.590> play

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
trace bitmap vector art left to play

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.830 
trace bitmap vector art left to play
with<00:04:47.420> okay<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.760> how<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.270> trace<00:04:51.810> a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
with okay so that is how you trace a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.650 
with okay so that is how you trace a
bitmap<00:04:52.700> automatically<00:04:53.700> again<00:04:54.060> not<00:04:54.270> quite<00:04:54.510> as

bitmap automatically again not quite as

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.090 
bitmap automatically again not quite as
detailed<00:04:54.930> as<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.630> previous<00:04:58.140> method<00:04:58.620> that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
detailed as the the previous method that

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.600 
detailed as the the previous method that
we<00:04:59.190> use<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.760> get<00:04:59.880> art<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.450> there<00:05:00.690> but<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.890> some

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
we use to get art in there but in some

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.490 
we use to get art in there but in some
cases<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:03.330> don't<00:05:03.510> need<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.780> quite<00:05:04.350> that

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
cases you don't need it quite that

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.110 
cases you don't need it quite that
detailed<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.130> can<00:05:05.190> get<00:05:05.370> away<00:05:05.490> with<00:05:05.790> just<00:05:05.970> a

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
detailed you can get away with just a

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.670 
detailed you can get away with just a
trace<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.630> bitmap<00:05:07.460> okay<00:05:09.200> that<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.380> for<00:05:10.620> this

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
trace to bitmap okay that is it for this

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.360 
trace to bitmap okay that is it for this
