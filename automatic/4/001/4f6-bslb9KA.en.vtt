compare the audio quality and see which
is<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.989> best<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:05.040> would<00:01:05.189> save<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is the best it would save a lot of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
is the best it would save a lot of
trouble<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.450> course<00:01:06.630> those<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.229> who<00:01:07.350> do

trouble of course those of you who do
this<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.240> record<00:01:09.510> into

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this know that if you can record into

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
this know that if you can record into
the<00:01:10.080> camera<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.710> decent<00:01:11.130> audio<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:12.240> saves

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tascam recording so that it should make

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
syncing it up pretty simple I generally
don't<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> problem<00:01:38.970> syncing<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> takes<00:01:39.960> me

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
don't have a problem syncing it takes me

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
don't have a problem syncing it takes me
a<00:01:40.200> while<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> generally<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.119> any

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a while but I generally don't have any

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
a while but I generally don't have any
problem<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.180> PluralEyes<00:01:45.770> program

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
problem I do have the PluralEyes program

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.740 
problem I do have the PluralEyes program
but<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.329> its<00:01:48.570> much

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
but you know I don't use that its much

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
but you know I don't use that its much
anymore<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:49.770> trouble<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.670> trouble<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
anymore it's more trouble more trouble I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
anymore it's more trouble more trouble I
think<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> worth<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.369> totally

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think then it's worth and it's totally

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.200 
think then it's worth and it's totally
not<00:01:54.479> necessary<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.560> most<00:01:55.920> situations<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
not necessary in most situations I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.639

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
cumbersome to use I'm hoping and what

cumbersome to use I'm hoping and what
I'm<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.590> try<00:03:19.769> next<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.549> plug<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
I'm going to try next is to plug the

itself<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.139> can<00:03:28.199> do<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.680> because<00:03:28.949> it's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
itself I can do that because it's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.490 
itself I can do that because it's
battery-powered<00:03:29.909> I<00:03:30.479> don't<00:03:31.019> need<00:03:31.199> to<00:03:31.349> have

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.229 
see how the audio quality of that
compares<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.409> audio<00:03:40.889> quality<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.669> this

now<00:03:45.599> I'm<00:03:45.780> running<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.319> sennheiser<00:03:46.889> directly

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
now I'm running this sennheiser directly

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.999 
now I'm running this sennheiser directly
into<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.239> camera<00:03:48.509> this<00:03:49.259> microphone<00:03:49.799> has

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
into the camera this microphone has

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.909 
into the camera this microphone has
plenty<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.430> gain<00:03:50.669> in<00:03:51.000> fact<00:03:51.379> I'm<00:03:52.379> running<00:03:52.769> it

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
plenty of gain in fact I'm running it

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.770 
plenty of gain in fact I'm running it
directly<00:03:53.400> into<00:03:53.729> the<00:03:53.819> camera<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.449> did<00:03:54.659> not

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
directly into the camera and I did not

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.809 
directly into the camera and I did not
have<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.290> adjust<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.799> settings<00:03:56.220> on<00:03:56.759> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
have to adjust the settings on the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.569 
have to adjust the settings on the
camera<00:03:57.689> and<00:03:57.870> all<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.139> have<00:03:58.650> them<00:03:58.829> set<00:03:59.189> at<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
camera and all I have them set at the

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.259 
camera and all I have them set at the
lowest<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.299> lowest<00:04:00.329> point<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:02.879> there<00:04:03.090> should

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
lowest the lowest point so there should

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.289 
lowest the lowest point so there should
be<00:04:03.299> no<00:04:03.479> no<00:04:04.259> noise<00:04:04.560> generated<00:04:05.370> by<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.639> preamps

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
be no no noise generated by the preamps

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.479 
be no no noise generated by the preamps
in<00:04:06.449> that<00:04:06.599> camera<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.139> this<00:04:07.290> actually<00:04:07.799> this

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
in that camera so this actually this

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.539 
in that camera so this actually this
actually<00:04:08.819> might<00:04:09.419> sound<00:04:09.810> pretty<00:04:10.169> good

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
actually might sound pretty good

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.449 
actually might sound pretty good
compared<00:04:11.549> compared<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.479> the<00:04:13.129> stuff<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.310> was

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
compared compared to the stuff I was

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.399 
compared compared to the stuff I was
doing<00:04:14.790> earlier<00:04:14.939> it<00:04:15.659> looks<00:04:15.840> like<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.049> massive

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
doing earlier it looks like a massive

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.770 
doing earlier it looks like a massive
storm<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.190> moving<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.699> here<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.539> weather

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
storm is moving in here the weather

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.779 
storm is moving in here the weather
people<00:04:19.049> did<00:04:19.349> not<00:04:19.470> predict<00:04:20.009> that<00:04:20.280> they<00:04:20.609> have

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
people did not predict that they have
