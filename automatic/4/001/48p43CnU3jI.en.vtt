00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
unfortunately number seven is a bit of a

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.490 
unfortunately number seven is a bit of a
slow<00:03:10.700> poke<00:03:10.939> thankfully<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:11.930> goalkeeper<00:03:12.409> is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
slow poke thankfully my goalkeeper is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.250 
slow poke thankfully my goalkeeper is
actually<00:03:12.769> pretty<00:03:12.980> good<00:03:13.389> in<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.599> top<00:03:14.780> left<00:03:14.989> you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
actually pretty good in the top left you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.750 
actually pretty good in the top left you
know<00:03:15.349> you'll<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.010> frames<00:03:16.220> per<00:03:16.400> second

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
know you'll see the frames per second

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.719 
know you'll see the frames per second
counter<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:18.229> up<00:03:18.319> this<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.979> is<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> way<00:03:19.699> that

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
counter going up this that is a way that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.399 
counter going up this that is a way that
you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.060> tell<00:03:20.389> that<00:03:20.419> this<00:03:20.659> game<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:20.930> still

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
you can tell that this game is still

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.399 
you can tell that this game is still
very<00:03:21.590> much<00:03:21.769> in<00:03:21.949> development<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.169> think

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
very much in development but I think

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.449 
very much in development but I think
most<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.829> good<00:03:24.949> stuff<00:03:25.129> is<00:03:25.370> actually

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
yeah I mean you know this is this is the

yeah I mean you know this is this is the
kind<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.939> kind<00:03:55.939> of<00:03:56.060> hero<00:03:56.209> i<00:03:56.329> think<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
kind of kind of hero i think that the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.240 
kind of kind of hero i think that the
developers<00:03:57.169> probably<00:03:57.620> quite<00:03:57.769> interested<00:03:58.129> in

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
developers probably quite interested in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.679 
developers probably quite interested in
and<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.810> also<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.769> sort<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.329> irritable<00:04:02.329> game

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
and it's also the sort of irritable game

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.679 
and it's also the sort of irritable game
that<00:04:03.409> wasn't<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:04.280> complicated<00:04:04.669> and<00:04:05.329> overly

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
that wasn't so complicated and overly

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.569 
that wasn't so complicated and overly
realistic<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.470> people<00:04:07.010> couldn't<00:04:07.159> get<00:04:07.310> into

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
realistic that people couldn't get into

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.129 
realistic that people couldn't get into
it<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:08.060> know<00:04:08.090> non<00:04:08.419> football<00:04:08.599> fans<00:04:08.930> couldn't

there what now the fact that my players
are<00:04:37.670> moving<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:37.970> bit<00:04:38.060> slowly<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.630> probably

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
are moving a bit slowly is probably

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.470 
are moving a bit slowly is probably
likely<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:40.670> do<00:04:40.760> with<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.940> fact<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.210> some<00:04:41.420> of

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
likely to do with the fact that some of

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.220 
likely to do with the fact that some of
them<00:04:41.600> are<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.750> bit<00:04:41.900> knackered<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:45.140> know

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
them are a bit knackered so you know

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.660 
them are a bit knackered so you know
sometimes<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.770> could<00:04:45.890> be<00:04:45.950> running<00:04:46.190> much<00:04:46.310> faster

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
sometimes I could be running much faster

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.360 
sometimes I could be running much faster
or<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:49.960> yeah<00:04:50.960> like<00:04:51.230> really<00:04:51.710> simple<00:04:52.010> controls

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
or so yeah like really simple controls

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.830 
or so yeah like really simple controls
but<00:04:52.850> totally<00:04:53.480> effective<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:56.720> know

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
but totally effective and you know

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.120 
but totally effective and you know
really<00:04:57.020> endearing<00:04:57.560> art<00:04:57.890> style<00:04:58.360> sound<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.660> ah

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
really endearing art style sound is ah

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.410 
really endearing art style sound is ah
No<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.170> sound<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:04.220> okay<00:05:04.370> it's<00:05:05.090> pretty

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
No so the sound is is okay it's pretty

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.570 
No so the sound is is okay it's pretty
good<00:05:05.630> a<00:05:05.920> little<00:05:06.920> bit<00:05:07.100> rough<00:05:07.250> around<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.520> edges

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
good a little bit rough around the edges

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.880 
good a little bit rough around the edges
in<00:05:08.090> spots<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:08.930> think<00:05:09.110> there's<00:05:09.290> much<00:05:09.620> much<00:05:09.830> more

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
in spots I think there's much much more

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.580 
in spots I think there's much much more
that<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.490> know<00:05:10.580> could<00:05:10.910> be<00:05:11.030> done<00:05:11.210> here<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:12.350> in

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
being a good football game and you know

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.270 
being a good football game and you know
there<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.170> managerial<00:05:45.740> aspect<00:05:46.100> that's

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
there is that managerial aspect that's

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.760 
there is that managerial aspect that's
outside<00:05:46.640> of<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:46.850> game<00:05:47.000> as<00:05:47.150> well<00:05:47.530> which<00:05:48.530> i

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
outside of the game as well which i

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.510 
outside of the game as well which i
think<00:05:48.920> is<00:05:49.130> quite<00:05:49.340> quite<00:05:50.090> appealing<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:52.280> at<00:05:52.460> the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
think is quite quite appealing so at the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.710 
think is quite quite appealing so at the
end<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.670> each<00:05:52.760> match<00:05:52.970> you've<00:05:53.240> got<00:05:53.390> your<00:05:53.540> match

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
end of each match you've got your match

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.660 
end of each match you've got your match
stats<00:05:53.960> as<00:05:54.230> you<00:05:54.350> as<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:54.920> as<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:55.340> probably

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
stats as you as you as you probably

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.210 
stats as you as you as you probably
expect<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:56.720> so<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.020> game<00:05:57.290> just<00:05:57.470> feels<00:05:57.710> really

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
expect but so the game just feels really

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.150 
expect but so the game just feels really
accessible<00:05:58.880> really<00:05:59.510> quick<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.840> play<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.650> feels

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
accessible really quick to play it feels

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.370 
accessible really quick to play it feels
deep<00:06:01.490> but<00:06:02.030> not<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:02.420> deep<00:06:02.600> that<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:03.020> kind<00:06:03.350> of

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
deep but not so deep that it's kind of

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.530 
deep but not so deep that it's kind of
