00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.289 

you<00:00:04.440> know<00:00:04.560> there's<00:00:05.040> two<00:00:05.220> big<00:00:05.430> things<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.180> I

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
you know there's two big things that I

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.600 
you know there's two big things that I
need<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> improve<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:08.099> coming<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
need to improve for this this coming to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.970 
need to improve for this this coming to
her<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.929> they<00:00:09.929> were<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
her and they were the two that that I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.730 
her and they were the two that that I
that<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.700> didn't<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:13.110> last<00:00:13.320> year's<00:00:13.559> tour

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
that I didn't have for last year's tour

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070 
that I didn't have for last year's tour
and<00:00:13.920> that's<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.910> time<00:00:15.089> trialing<00:00:15.540> has<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.900> come

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and that's the time trialing has to come

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.500 
and that's the time trialing has to come
back<00:00:16.260> maybe<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.190> doesn't<00:00:17.490> need<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> be<00:00:17.880> back<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
back maybe it doesn't need to be back to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.620 
back maybe it doesn't need to be back to
oh<00:00:18.900> four<00:00:19.380> or<00:00:19.410> five<00:00:19.800> levels<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.270> got<00:00:21.480> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
oh four or five levels but it's got to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
oh four or five levels but it's got to
be<00:00:21.660> back<00:00:21.930> close<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> second<00:00:23.609> thing<00:00:23.699> is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
be back close and the second thing is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.859 
be back close and the second thing is
just<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:25.380> top-end<00:00:25.800> speed<00:00:26.869> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
just this this top-end speed and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.250 
just this this top-end speed and
acceleration<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.920> punch<00:00:29.660> that<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> lacked<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
acceleration and punch that I lacked in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
acceleration and punch that I lacked in
the<00:00:31.380> mountains<00:00:31.740> last<00:00:31.890> year<00:00:32.390> again<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.630> had<00:00:34.140> all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the mountains last year again I had all

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
the mountains last year again I had all
of<00:00:34.320> those<00:00:34.530> things<00:00:34.800> before<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
of those things before I think the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.450 
of those things before I think the
acceleration<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> punch<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
acceleration and the punch is just

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510 
acceleration and the punch is just
harder<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:39.410> 38<00:00:40.410> 39<00:00:40.800> years<00:00:41.160> old<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
harder when you're 38 39 years old and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
harder when you're 38 39 years old and
you're<00:00:41.610> racing<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:41.969> 25<00:00:42.780> 26<00:00:43.440> 28<00:00:44.070> year<00:00:44.340> old

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you're racing with 25 26 28 year old

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
you're racing with 25 26 28 year old
guys<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.960> let<00:00:45.960> her<00:00:46.050> punchy<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
guys that let her punchy they have that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
guys that let her punchy they have that
acceleration<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:49.379> only<00:00:49.410> can

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
acceleration and they can not only can

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
acceleration and they can not only can
they<00:00:49.890> accelerate<00:00:50.340> once<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.940> can

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
they accelerate once but they can

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
they accelerate once but they can
accelerate<00:00:51.660> three<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:52.739> four<00:00:52.949> times<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.980> even

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
accelerate three or four times and even

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.619 
accelerate three or four times and even
if<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> doesn't<00:00:56.430> come<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.910> hope<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> get

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
if it doesn't come back I hope to get

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
if it doesn't come back I hope to get
some<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> doesn't<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
some of it back but if it doesn't I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
some of it back but if it doesn't I
think<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> adapt<00:01:01.530> your

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
think you just have to adapt your

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
think you just have to adapt your
strategy<00:01:02.250> whereas<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> past<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.210> my

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
strategy whereas in the past that was my

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.750 
strategy whereas in the past that was my
strategy<00:01:03.650> he<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> guys<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> limit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
strategy he put the guys on the limit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
strategy he put the guys on the limit
give<00:01:06.330> him<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.630> acceleration<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> race

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
give him one good acceleration the race

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.210 
give him one good acceleration the race
was<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.600> pretty<00:01:09.780> simple<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.860> saw<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
was over it's pretty simple we saw that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.969 
was over it's pretty simple we saw that
movie<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.850> seven<00:01:12.270> times<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
movie like seven times I think but if

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
movie like seven times I think but if
that<00:01:14.130> doesn't<00:01:14.490> work<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> can't<00:01:15.630> get

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that doesn't work and you can't get

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
that doesn't work and you can't get
close<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.890> adopt<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
close to that then you just adopt the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
close to that then you just adopt the
strategy<00:01:17.670> where<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:19.140> train<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
strategy where you you train that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
strategy where you you train that
threshold<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.490> high<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.729> possible<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
threshold to be as high as possible and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
threshold to be as high as possible and
you<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.960> ride<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.229> pace<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> let<00:01:23.490> them

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you just ride your pace and let them

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
you just ride your pace and let them
accelerate<00:01:24.180> let<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.570> attack<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> they

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
accelerate let them attack and they

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
accelerate let them attack and they
might<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.869> ten<00:01:27.869> seconds<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.409> might<00:01:28.619> get

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
might get ten seconds they might get

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
might get ten seconds they might get
twenty<00:01:29.340> seconds<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.270> continue<00:01:30.630> at

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
twenty seconds but you just continue at

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
twenty seconds but you just continue at
a<00:01:30.930> high<00:01:31.170> tempo<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> quick

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
a high tempo it's not a quick

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480 
a high tempo it's not a quick
acceleration<00:01:33.049> but<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> fast<00:01:34.470> pace<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
acceleration but it's a fast pace and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
acceleration but it's a fast pace and
you<00:01:35.640> hope<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:37.409> after<00:01:37.740> their

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you hope that that after their

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
you hope that that after their
acceleration<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> times

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
acceleration which a lot of times

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.050 
acceleration which a lot of times
happens<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.960> come<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> group<00:01:41.060> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
happens they come back to the group so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
happens they come back to the group so
there's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> couple<00:01:43.110> different<00:01:43.229> ways<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> go

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
there's a couple different ways to go

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.240 
there's a couple different ways to go
about<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> we'll<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.700> how<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.990> how

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
about it we'll see how see how

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.080 
about it we'll see how see how
Camas<00:01:48.010> 2010<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.160> completely<00:01:49.640> different<00:01:49.790> than

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
Camas 2010 is completely different than

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.120 
Camas 2010 is completely different than
2009<00:01:50.750> though<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> mean<00:01:51.200> might<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.800> way<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
2009 though I mean might the way the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.800 
2009 though I mean might the way the
