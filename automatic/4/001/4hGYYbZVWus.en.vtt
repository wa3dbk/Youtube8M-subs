00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi friends is at xi and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.730
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.649
 new tutor how to kill the winter 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.330
 easily first of all you have 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.650
 started going underground and digging 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.030
 a room of about 50 by 50 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.560
 once the room were digging were going all 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 at the bottom where you're going to make the spawn of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.369
 your winter above spawn digging 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.680
 a hole for it to hang in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.000
 ceiling once invoked you will see 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.640
 thanks to this blog you will be able to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 kill a lot easier of course 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 you must have seen that the opposite of the spawn 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.329
 of the monitor there is a door in the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 room simply this room is going 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.450
 allow yourself in case you lose 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 too much vidal and regenerate you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 quiet now we're going 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 learn a little bit and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.480
 monitor features thanks to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
 all the tests I did so all 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 first the winter to explode the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 blocks even through the water they move on to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.890
 through the bedrock can not suffocate 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 in the walls does not die in the lava 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 so is the only way to kill me this is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.500
 to put me in a hole and destroy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.000
 your map 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.689
 so now we are going to move on 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 to summon the wind once invoked 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.810
 you will be able to observe that the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.820
 winter regenerates his life because he does not have it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.170
 at most while it regenerates that yes 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 I advise you to move away from 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 him because after his trip generated he goes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 to make a big explosion 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.000
 once explosion normally makes the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 winter should not move 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.240
 so I advise you to go to the body 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.409
 to body and put him a shot 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.850
 of sword because as you can the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 see on the video it is fragile and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 push back so put him a sword stroke 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 and there he goes up to the ceiling in the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.390
 hole that you dug over 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 his head he's going his look is in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.780
 after I advise you to start 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 distance from him and shoot him 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.299
 tired you are afraid he will say 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.299
 you're sitting easily thanks angeles 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.629
 once you are you will finally be able to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.330
 recover your star from an error that 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.860
 you absolutely wanted 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.430
 So here I hope that this tutorial 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.349
 will have pleased 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.150
