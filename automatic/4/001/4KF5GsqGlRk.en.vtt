performance<00:00:06.290> one<00:00:06.649> of<00:00:06.799> the<00:00:06.919> worst<00:00:07.160> things<00:00:07.549> I

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:07.879 
performance one of the worst things I

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.320 
performance one of the worst things I
have<00:00:08.360> ever<00:00:08.570> seen<00:00:08.719> done<00:00:09.469> on<00:00:09.800> a<00:00:09.830> cricket<00:00:10.099> field

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.690 

you<00:00:14.330> still<00:00:14.599> count<00:00:15.110> that<00:00:15.379> race<00:00:15.710> as<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.400> proper

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
you still count that race as a proper

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.960 
you still count that race as a proper
race<00:00:17.000> victory<00:00:17.360> for<00:00:17.510> yourself<00:00:17.840> yes<00:00:18.080> I<00:00:18.640> do

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
race victory for yourself yes I do

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.180 
race victory for yourself yes I do
even<00:00:20.480> though<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:21.170> team<00:00:21.410> effective<00:00:22.130> to

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
even though the team effective to

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.370 
even though the team effective to
collectively<00:00:22.520> manufactured<00:00:23.120> it<00:00:23.240> but<00:00:23.990> I<00:00:24.020> think

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
collectively manufactured it but I think

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.080 
collectively manufactured it but I think
that's<00:00:26.350> interpretation<00:00:27.670> for<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.760> cutting<00:00:29.000> in

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
that's interpretation for the cutting in

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.760 
that's interpretation for the cutting in
fact<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.450> issue<00:00:29.870> is<00:00:30.020> is<00:00:30.170> whether<00:00:30.380> he<00:00:30.620> was

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
fact that issue is is whether he was

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.360 
fact that issue is is whether he was
injured<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.950> right<00:00:34.160> if

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
injured and and you have a right if

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.500 
injured and and you have a right if
something<00:00:34.400> has<00:00:34.730> occurred<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.120> bring<00:00:35.270> them<00:00:35.390> off

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510
