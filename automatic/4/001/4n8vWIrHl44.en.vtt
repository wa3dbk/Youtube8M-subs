 productive enough 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.290
 smartly i would say so interesting 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:33.250
 here is the last processor installed 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.239
 family haswell core 5 and 4 gigahertz 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.800
 and the process is needed here is not mobile 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.870
 as in laptops installed here 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.180
 full processor which principle 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:49.569
 can be replaced by any of what you 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.400
 want a given safety but upgrade question 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.080
 we postpone for the next issues let's 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.850
 by current configuration 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 here's the RAM here is 8 gigabytes 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:05.290
 nvidia geforce gtx770 5 graphics chip 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.130
 2 gigabytes per screen extension here 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.450
 really very big it 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:17.310
 27 inch monitor 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.739
 screen with extension 2,560 by 1440 pixels 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.080
 we have a hard disk here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.830
 please this is hdd hard disk on 1 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.919
 terabyte it is divided into two virtual 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.330
 drives 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.090
 this is the operating system of us 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.500
 installed directly here 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:47.460
 mac os here I find any 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.760
 another monotonous video 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.010
 aki external 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.530
 external drive is also spiritually present 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.660
 because 1 terabyte is very small but 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.320
 external drive mom have you ever he 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:09.539
 showed it here so interesting 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.539
 metal solution is interesting here 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 hiding 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.310
 here from memory ram here 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.030
 8 gigabytes for a bracket of 2 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.080
 gigabyte 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.930
 at 1600 megahertz, I want to continue 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.690
 deliver two more memory strips and 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:39.460
 actually you calmly 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:43.270
 enjoy ok let's go with you then 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.200
 let's talk now about the monitor how much 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.740
 convenient and pleasant to use 27 inches 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:55.060
 for ordinary ordinary person 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:59.139
 In fact, 27 inches seems to me that this 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.730
 Well, probably the perfect size here if you 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.440
 on the computer we allow graphics and 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.070
 Cabinet you often enough look 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.280
 films 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.790
 it is very convenient 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.490
 now I can take off my chair 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.990
 apologize arrogant arrogant face mine 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.460
 understand 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.770
 yes hello everyone here and in this position 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.620
 until being here the screen is not enough 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.520
 comfortable and pleasant to view 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.930
 essentially saying the film is the price given 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.270
 there is enough computer on the market 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.690
 but moreover, the cost can be 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.800
 build a more productive solution 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.380
 on windows but here is a completely different league 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.810
 it's hard to talk about it and so on 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.540
 also of course there are a large number 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.940
 applications for which the macro is not 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.370
 absolutely everyone is satisfied with them no more 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.840
 what is missing 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.580
 Actually I will not get there ringgit 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.220
 Lights well, just not right now, I'll show you what 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:05.110
 the fact that I will allow some more game of the year 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:07.930
 these are the games i play from 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.919
 official purchased appstore and 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.510
 games that is not cracked not kryaknuty 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:18.710
 fully purchased that is, without any 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:21.170
 problems you can comfortably play them 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:24.920
 observing no moments not afraid not 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.630
 that's actually gone so 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.270
 a short release just to 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.930
 did you understand that in the near future we 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.460
 we will then talk to you 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.650
 but we'll talk about what to pay 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.800
 attention when choosing 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:43.970
 well mrk yes that is if you decide to go 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.280
 on apple technique and you don't know but 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.890
 what is the minimum for order 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.210
 to put the houses up to the feet and 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.480
 feels more or less comfortable 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.010
 even there play some games with this 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.780
 don't pay big money there because 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.150
 understandably if you take the dumbest on 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.040
 vibration on the principle without problems 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.990
 almost not all or which is represented in 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.710
 appstore so it is important to know so 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.710
 further all bye
