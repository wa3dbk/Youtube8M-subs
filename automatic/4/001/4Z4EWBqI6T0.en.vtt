00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 realized here that it was very interesting 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.789

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.379
 where he calls the customer by name gives a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 special treatment it has a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.060
 intelligence to identify by 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.740
 example stop notifications if 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 this customer has outstanding debts with the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 provider and manages to do so 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.220
 summarized the support at level 1 and 2 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.040
 its service fully in order 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.770
 not only be able to meet 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 the client but instead return links to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.439
 return customers make the appraisal 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.159
 an end to a range of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.770
 solutions that every provider 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.450
 should be due to lack of hands 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 of work in the market that today everyone 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.970

 work in the middle of some of the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.659

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.950
 very accurately is not recording 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.860
 there are software that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.160
 are static recordings we do not 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.420
 We talked in recording we said that. 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.280
 dynamically so much that we call the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 customer by his name at the time 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.989

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.010
 so there is no recording is one 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 totally dynamic and that is what 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.300
 makes the product more interesting
