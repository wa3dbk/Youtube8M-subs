to<00:03:59.190> reconfiguring<00:04:00.000> your<00:04:00.030> weights<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.510> this

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
to reconfiguring your weights in this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.480 
to reconfiguring your weights in this
manner<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.560> allows<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.280> utilize

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
manner is that allows you to utilize

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.699 
manner is that allows you to utilize
less<00:04:03.000> rod<00:04:03.300> space<00:04:03.600> for<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.959> weights<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.620> you

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
less rod space for the weights so you

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.890 
less rod space for the weights so you
have<00:04:04.800> more<00:04:05.010> rod<00:04:05.280> space<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.790> front<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.720> also

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
have more rod space to the front it also

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.660 
have more rod space to the front it also
allows<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.500> kick<00:04:07.770> more<00:04:08.010> weight<00:04:08.280> towards

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
allows you to kick more weight towards

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.340 
allows you to kick more weight towards
the<00:04:08.820> back<00:04:09.000> which<00:04:09.420> allows<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.110> better

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
of the clamp you're going to have to

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.159 
of the clamp you're going to have to
have<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.640> variety<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.240> rod<00:05:53.570> lengths<00:05:53.990> to

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
lens that you're using because the rods

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.620 
lens that you're using because the rods
will<00:05:58.160> actually<00:05:58.580> bottom<00:05:58.940> out<00:05:59.060> on<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.360> camera

will actually bottom out on the camera

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.810 
will actually bottom out on the camera
so<00:06:00.560> you<00:06:00.650> won't<00:06:00.800> have<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:00.979> room<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.700> adjust

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
so you won't have that room to adjust

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.490 
so you won't have that room to adjust
