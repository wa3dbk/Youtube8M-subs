we'll<00:01:12.000> continue<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:13.140> development

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
we'll continue to see more development

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.249 
we'll continue to see more development
of<00:01:13.799> container<00:01:14.250> gardening<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.630> whole<00:01:15.810> concept

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of container gardening the whole concept

of container gardening the whole concept
pot<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> these<00:01:17.009> groundbreaking

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pot is it was these groundbreaking

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
pot is it was these groundbreaking
plants<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.299> mixed<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.200> together<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
plants that mixed very well together so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
plants that mixed very well together so
it's<00:01:20.430> mixing<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> petunia<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> verbena

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it's mixing a petunia with a verbena

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
it's mixing a petunia with a verbena
with<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> calibrachoa<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> planter
