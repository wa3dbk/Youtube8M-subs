00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you do have 1 gig of ram which is pretty

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
much a base for Windows 8.1 it's going

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.540

it<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.980> miracast<00:03:00.580> ready<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.239> actually

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it is miracast ready so you can actually

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.809 
it is miracast ready so you can actually
use<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:01.840> four<00:03:02.319> miracast<00:03:02.819> capabilities

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
use it for four miracast capabilities

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.150 
use it for four miracast capabilities
and<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> battery<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.080> estimated<00:03:05.709> at<00:03:05.800> seven

last<00:03:08.319> longer<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.400> was<00:03:09.519> about<00:03:09.730> twelve

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
last longer and it was about twelve

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.570 
last longer and it was about twelve
point<00:03:10.450> five<00:03:10.750> ounces<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.410> it's<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:12.310> still<00:03:12.519> a

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
point five ounces so it's it's still a

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.280 
point five ounces so it's it's still a
little<00:03:12.790> thicker<00:03:13.209> device<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.959> would<00:03:14.080> think

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
little thicker device you would think

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.420 
little thicker device you would think
you<00:03:14.410> would<00:03:14.470> hope<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.920> was<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> little<00:03:15.280> bit

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
you would hope it was a little bit

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.530 
you would hope it was a little bit
thinner<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.030> flatter<00:03:16.450> now<00:03:16.810> prebuilt

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540

but<00:03:21.730> let's<00:03:21.940> go<00:03:22.150> ahead<00:03:22.180> spot<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:23.140> and

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
but let's go ahead spot this up and

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.770 
but let's go ahead spot this up and
basically<00:03:24.459> jump<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.150> see<00:03:25.360> what<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.630> have

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
basically jump in and see what we have

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.539 
basically jump in and see what we have
there<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> course<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.860> our<00:03:27.010> old<00:03:27.250> set<00:03:27.430> up

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
there of course to our old set up

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.880 
there of course to our old set up
process<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.870> one<00:03:29.260> thing<00:03:29.410> I'll<00:03:29.500> mention<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
process I one thing I'll mention the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860 
process I one thing I'll mention the
speakers<00:03:30.250> at<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> bottom<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.030> they<00:03:31.269> are<00:03:31.299> mono

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
speakers at the bottom and they are mono

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.620 
speakers at the bottom and they are mono
speakers<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.670> after<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.910> whole<00:03:34.060> setup<00:03:34.390> you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
speakers so after the whole setup you

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.600 
speakers so after the whole setup you
can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.959> we're<00:03:35.140> running<00:03:35.290> Windows<00:03:35.769> 8.1<00:03:36.010> it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
can see we're running Windows 8.1 it

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.250 
can see we're running Windows 8.1 it
actually<00:03:36.850> takes<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> straight<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.570> your

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
actually takes you straight to your

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.000 
actually takes you straight to your
Start<00:03:39.100> menu<00:03:39.660> but<00:03:40.660> again<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.320> know<00:03:41.500> it'd<00:03:41.799> be

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
Start menu but again you know it'd be

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.500 
Start menu but again you know it'd be
interesting<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.549> see<00:03:42.730> how<00:03:42.970> well<00:03:43.299> this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
interesting to see how well this

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.449 
interesting to see how well this
performs<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:46.260> 7-inch<00:03:47.260> Windows<00:03:48.190> 8

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
performs this is a 7-inch Windows 8

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
windows 8.1 for windows so interesting

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500 
windows 8.1 for windows so interesting
to<00:03:56.500> see<00:03:56.680> how<00:03:56.829> well<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.040> performs<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:57.940> terms<00:03:58.209> of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
to see how well it performs in terms of
