string<00:01:06.630> height<00:01:07.250> if<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:09.330> point<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.140> get

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
string height if at any point you get

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
string height if at any point you get
into<00:01:10.920> fixing<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.400> base<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.030> stuck

bad or a difficult fix and that takes
professional<00:01:26.490> okay<00:01:26.759> let's<00:01:27.270> discuss<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
professional okay let's discuss the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
professional okay let's discuss the
truss<00:01:27.840> rod<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.890> truss<00:01:29.130> rod<00:01:29.369> runs<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.119> length

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
truss rod the truss rod runs the length

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.960 
truss rod the truss rod runs the length
or<00:01:30.659> close<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> length<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.100> B<00:01:32.280> fingerboard

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
or close to the length of B fingerboard

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.830 
or close to the length of B fingerboard
and<00:01:34.369> there's<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:36.030> ways<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> probably<00:01:36.689> get

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and there's two ways to probably get

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
and there's two ways to probably get
into<00:01:37.740> adjusting<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.430> usually<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
into adjusting it usually at the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.600 
into adjusting it usually at the
headstock<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.369> base<00:01:41.610> has<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
headstock up here like this base has the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.639 
headstock up here like this base has the
adjustment<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> headstock<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.649> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
adjustment at the headstock and this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.370 
adjustment at the headstock and this
base<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> adjustment<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.509> bottom<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
base has the adjustment at the bottom of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.280 
base has the adjustment at the bottom of
the<00:01:49.500> neck<00:01:49.710> where<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.360> neck<00:01:51.360> meets<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> body

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the neck where the neck meets the body

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.969 
the neck where the neck meets the body
okay<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:55.259> want<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> correct

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
truss rod does it dictates and tells the

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.280 
truss rod does it dictates and tells the
neck<00:02:52.540> whether<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:54.340> way<00:02:54.510> boat<00:02:55.510> or<00:02:55.900> this

way<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.709> back<00:02:57.040> bow<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.060> way<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.359> does<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.569> is

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
way a back bow the way it does that is

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.210 
way a back bow the way it does that is
by<00:02:59.290> tightening<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.099> loosening<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:02.010> equate<00:03:03.010> it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
by tightening and loosening I equate it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.640 
by tightening and loosening I equate it
to<00:03:03.599> string<00:03:04.599> tension<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.500> if<00:03:05.950> my<00:03:06.790> neck<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.650> both

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
to string tension so if my neck is both

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.449 
to string tension so if my neck is both
like<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.690> alright<00:03:10.690> I'll<00:03:11.109> tighten<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.220> truss

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
like this alright I'll tighten the truss

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.039 
like this alright I'll tighten the truss
rod<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.909> remember<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.209> righty<00:03:13.599> tighty<00:03:13.900> lefty

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
rod so remember that righty tighty lefty

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.009 
rod so remember that righty tighty lefty
loosey<00:03:14.349> comes<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.400> handy<00:03:15.549> here<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:16.329> if<00:03:16.480> my<00:03:16.630> neck

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
loosey comes in handy here so if my neck

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.740 
loosey comes in handy here so if my neck
is<00:03:17.290> bowed<00:03:17.889> and<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.760> strings<00:03:19.090> are<00:03:19.239> really<00:03:19.569> high

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
is bowed and my strings are really high

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.680 
is bowed and my strings are really high
off<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.169> neck<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.700> go<00:03:21.700> ahead<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.060> tighten<00:03:22.419> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
off the neck I go ahead and tighten it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.020 
off the neck I go ahead and tighten it
so<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.440> strings<00:03:23.889> can't<00:03:24.250> pull<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.790> hard

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
so that the strings can't pull it's hard

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.930 
so that the strings can't pull it's hard
on<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.359> net<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.169> that<00:03:26.709> actually<00:03:27.190> tightening

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
on the net and that actually tightening

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.610 
on the net and that actually tightening
the<00:03:28.060> truss<00:03:28.269> rod<00:03:28.480> will<00:03:28.780> straighten<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.440> neck

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the truss rod will straighten the neck

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.589 
the truss rod will straighten the neck
out<00:03:29.829> that's<00:03:30.700> another<00:03:30.970> thing<00:03:31.269> when<00:03:31.480> you're

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
out that's another thing when you're

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.990 
out that's another thing when you're
tightening<00:03:32.019> or<00:03:32.530> loosening<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.549> truss<00:03:33.760> rod

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
tightening or loosening the truss rod

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.440 
tightening or loosening the truss rod
take<00:03:34.419> it<00:03:34.629> slow<00:03:35.169> slow<00:03:35.769> slow<00:03:35.940> eighth<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.269> turn

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
take it slow slow slow eighth of a turn

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.229 
take it slow slow slow eighth of a turn
of<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.720> time<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.230> wait<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:39.160> few<00:03:39.700> minutes<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
of the time and wait a few minutes a

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.839 
of the time and wait a few minutes a
good<00:03:40.660> amount<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.930> time<00:03:41.109> time<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.220> then<00:03:42.519> site

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
good amount of time time and then site

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.240 
good amount of time time and then site
down<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> neck<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.680> cite<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
down the neck I you can cite that in a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.750 
down the neck I you can cite that in a
couple<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.639> ways<00:03:46.169> either<00:03:47.169> like<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.310> from<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
couple of ways either like this from the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.479 
couple of ways either like this from the
bridge<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.440> look<00:03:50.620> at<00:03:50.769> both<00:03:50.949> sides<00:03:50.980> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
bridge and you look at both sides and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.830 
bridge and you look at both sides and
hopefully<00:03:51.879> both<00:03:52.090> sides<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.569> neck<00:03:52.690> are

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
hopefully both sides of the neck are

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.930 
hopefully both sides of the neck are
going<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.019> be<00:03:53.109> pretty<00:03:53.349> equal<00:03:53.889> whatever<00:03:54.669> it<00:03:54.819> is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
going to be pretty equal whatever it is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.479 
going to be pretty equal whatever it is
um<00:03:55.329> or<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:56.889> can<00:03:57.040> look<00:03:57.220> at<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.430> down<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.590> from

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
um or you can look at it down the from

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.170 
um or you can look at it down the from
the<00:04:00.579> headstock<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.569> either<00:04:01.810> way<00:04:02.169> works<00:04:03.180> so

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
the headstock so either way works so

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.199 
the headstock so either way works so
again<00:04:04.739> truss<00:04:05.739> rod<00:04:06.010> tightening<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.090> loosening

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
again truss rod tightening and loosening

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.240 
again truss rod tightening and loosening
will<00:04:07.750> tell<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.109> strings<00:04:08.379> how<00:04:08.560> much<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.919> pull

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
will tell the strings how much to pull

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.949 
will tell the strings how much to pull
that<00:04:09.459> neck<00:04:09.730> or<00:04:09.970> how<00:04:10.120> much<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.449> allow<00:04:10.629> the<00:04:10.660> neck

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
that neck or how much to allow the neck

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.210 
that neck or how much to allow the neck
to<00:04:10.989> bend<00:04:11.470> either<00:04:12.370> way<00:04:12.579> so<00:04:12.940> if<00:04:13.480> my<00:04:13.769> neck<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.949> bent

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
to bend either way so if my neck is bent

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.000 
to bend either way so if my neck is bent
or<00:04:15.699> both<00:04:16.060> this<00:04:16.780> way<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:17.500> strings<00:04:17.769> are<00:04:17.889> high

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
or both this way and my strings are high

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.149 
or both this way and my strings are high
I'm<00:04:18.639> going<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.120> tighten<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.959> truss<00:04:20.199> rod<00:04:20.440> so

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
I'm going to tighten the truss rod so

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.950 
I'm going to tighten the truss rod so
that<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.459> strings<00:04:21.789> can't<00:04:22.300> pull<00:04:22.510> as<00:04:22.630> much<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that the strings can't pull as much and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.839 
that the strings can't pull as much and
that's<00:04:23.020> going<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.289> straighten<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.770> neck<00:04:23.979> in

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
that's going to straighten the neck in

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.490 
that's going to straighten the neck in
turn<00:04:25.240> opposite<00:04:26.140> if

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
turn opposite if

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.430 
turn opposite if
I<00:04:26.530> neck<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:28.930> strings<00:04:29.290> are

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
I neck is like this and my strings are

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.590 
I neck is like this and my strings are
laying<00:04:29.680> on<00:04:29.980> that<00:04:30.010> on<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.850> fretboard<00:04:31.180> and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
laying on that on the fretboard and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.010 
laying on that on the fretboard and
they're<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.470> know<00:04:33.330> hitting<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.510> fret<00:04:34.750> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
they're you know hitting the fret and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.290 
they're you know hitting the fret and
causing<00:04:35.710> all<00:04:35.800> kinds<00:04:35.830> of<00:04:36.130> buzz<00:04:36.340> what<00:04:37.060> I'm<00:04:37.150> going

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
causing all kinds of buzz what I'm going

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.900 
causing all kinds of buzz what I'm going
to<00:04:37.330> do<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.600> I'm<00:04:37.690> going<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.900> loosen<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.820> I'm

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
to do is I'm going to loosen that so I'm

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
to do is I'm going to loosen that so I'm
going<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.120> loosen<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.510> truss<00:04:40.750> rod<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.530> that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
going to loosen the truss rod so that

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.700 
going to loosen the truss rod so that
the<00:04:41.860> strings<00:04:42.220> can<00:04:42.490> pull<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:42.910> neck<00:04:43.390> up<00:04:44.260> a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
the strings can pull that neck up a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.430 
the strings can pull that neck up a
little<00:04:45.280> bit<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.750> everybody<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:47.200> different

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
little bit so everybody is different

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.100 
little bit so everybody is different
people<00:04:47.950> play<00:04:48.160> differently<00:04:48.880> they<00:04:49.690> dig<00:04:49.900> in

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
people play differently they dig in

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.770 
people play differently they dig in
people<00:04:50.890> like<00:04:51.250> their<00:04:51.460> action<00:04:52.030> adjusted<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.600> lot

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
people like their action adjusted a lot

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.450 
people like their action adjusted a lot
of<00:04:52.870> different<00:04:52.900> ways<00:04:53.230> some<00:04:54.130> people<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.430> it

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
of different ways some people like it

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.010 
of different ways some people like it
high<00:04:54.700> some<00:04:54.970> people<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.300> low<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.810> like<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
high some people like it low I like a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.110 
high some people like it low I like a
fairly<00:04:56.380> low<00:04:56.530> action<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.380> basically<00:05:00.340> it

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
fairly low action so that basically it

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.960 
fairly low action so that basically it
is<00:05:01.630> up<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.110> how<00:05:02.440> much<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.220> bow<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.700> want

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970

is up to you how much of a bow you want
I<00:05:04.090> mean<00:05:04.210> generally<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.900> want<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.200> little<00:05:05.680> tiny

I mean generally you want a little tiny

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.690 
I mean generally you want a little tiny
bit<00:05:06.250> up<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.750> that's<00:05:07.960> truss<00:05:08.230> rod<00:05:08.440> again<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
bit up so that's truss rod again the

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.850 
bit up so that's truss rod again the
truss<00:05:09.970> rod<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:10.570> it's<00:05:10.810> both<00:05:11.080> like<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:11.620> you

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
truss rod if it's both like this you

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.700 
truss rod if it's both like this you
want<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.419> tighten<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:14.080> strings<00:05:14.380> can't

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710

want to tighten so the strings can't
pull<00:05:14.919> as<00:05:15.070> much<00:05:15.190> it's<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.550> straighten

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
pull as much it's going to straighten

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.640 
pull as much it's going to straighten
the<00:05:15.850> neck<00:05:16.030> out<00:05:16.180> if<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.540> bowed<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:17.500> your

the neck out if it's bowed and your
strings<00:05:17.919> are<00:05:18.070> flapping<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:19.330> know<00:05:19.480> making<00:05:19.960> all

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
strings are flapping you know making all

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.890 
strings are flapping you know making all
kinds<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.410> noise<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.010> fretboard<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.660> want

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900

kinds of noise on the fretboard you want
to<00:05:23.169> loosen<00:05:23.919> it<00:05:24.070> so<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.250> strings<00:05:24.460> can<00:05:24.610> pull<00:05:24.880> a

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
to loosen it so the strings can pull a

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.390 
to loosen it so the strings can pull a
little<00:05:25.150> bit<00:05:25.330> more<00:05:25.510> okay<00:05:26.140> so<00:05:26.740> that's<00:05:26.919> truss<00:05:27.190> rod

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
little bit more okay so that's truss rod

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.090 
little bit more okay so that's truss rod
adjustment<00:05:27.430> take<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.360> slow<00:05:28.510> eighth<00:05:29.440> of<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.860> turn

adjustment take it slow eighth of a turn

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.969 
adjustment take it slow eighth of a turn
at<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.550> time<00:05:30.940> very<00:05:31.660> slowly<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.440> other<00:05:32.560> thing<00:05:32.800> is

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
at a time very slowly the other thing is

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.640 
at a time very slowly the other thing is
if<00:05:33.010> your<00:05:33.340> trust<00:05:33.580> ride<00:05:33.729> is<00:05:33.850> not<00:05:33.880> moving<00:05:34.650> stop
