00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 to prepare a Russian salad 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.410
 Russian salad is very simple just 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.590
 It consists of egg carrot potato 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.379
 tuna and mayonnaise and salt many people will 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.990
 throw peas for example to me I do not 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.660
 like pressure there are many varieties other 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 people throw beets 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.790
 lettuce there are many types of varieties 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.830
 of Russian salad, what I do is 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.180
 caught against the potatoes we are five 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.830
 people then then if you take a 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.230
 potato for each person one more potato or 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 less than this size then what I have 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.379
 done has been peeling and cutting them 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 because then when we put them to 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.449
 boil and then have to paste the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 cut them and everything breaks many and 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.960
 makes us like puree then they are 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.949
 we will simply pass them a drainer 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.320
 with cold water and the whole 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.090
 potato the carrot made the same 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 eggs not the games always say that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.469
 you can lose peel and put them to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.890
 boil then now that we do already 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.020
 prepare the pots and put it to boil the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.740
 carrot with the potato and the egg what 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.200
 we put aside you see now what we do 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.910
 is to put it on the fire and this you have to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 be controlling because you realize 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.979
 that if you can not undo the pinche is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.250
 a potato when you see that it is already 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 You catch it quickly I went through the squeegee 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 to cold water with the egg the same good 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 the egg does not happen anything can be left 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 there cooking and then we will mix 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 All the ingredients 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 We peel the egg, cut it to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 square and we put it together with the pathetic 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.520
 cooked carrot and we would throw the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.560
 tuna first of all we would throw him out 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 to the carrot and potato the salt and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.760
 then we would catch the tuna 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.550
 because the tuna already comes with salt now what 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.350
 we will see many thanks now 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.840
 that the egg is cooked what we do 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 is to chop it and the potato will pass it to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 drain then I will chop the egg 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 that I'm not going to take it out because if it's not going 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 take a long time and I'm going to drain this and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.790
 Now I'm going to mix everything and you see 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.200
 how I mix it good now as you see 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 we have gone through cold water so that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 the potato is not a europe and we miss it 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.380
 a little salt 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.030
 I have not done much because yours have 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.230
 to then then what we do is 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.910
 throw the tuna that is not necessary 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.900
 not that you take all the oil with 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.900
 take it a little bit 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 Tomb taste is like what 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.760
 you have to the taste of each person one 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 you can take more tuna you can take more 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.580
 older and one can be that for 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.940
 your taste 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.520
 the carrot as I said there are many 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.170
 variants and people we will throw the cha 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.090
 onion peas 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 there are people who are onion I do not echo 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.700
 onion because it's in the classic this 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.440
 is the normal in basic thrown 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.230
 so now what we do is with 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.000
 we remove a little care and now 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.160
 we add the mayonnaise that does not 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 I can teach because we can throw ourselves 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.209
 a year because you have to move that already 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 you will see it finished thank you very much 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.530
 well you see the Russian salad is already 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.269
 finished we have put a few leaves 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.060
 of lettuce around there are people who 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.130
 puts some red peppers and puts some 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.080
 olives and the cooked egg also 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.850
 towards what happens that I 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.709
 truth that I have not put because I do not 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.650
 like the pepper then for then 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.470
 have to remove it and spoil the pepper 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.790
 foolishly, well , I do not put many 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.100
