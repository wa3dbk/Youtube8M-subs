magic<00:03:10.290> over<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:10.770> last<00:03:10.920> few<00:03:11.070> years<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.580> in

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
magic over the last few years and in

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.100 
magic over the last few years and in
some<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.240> successes<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.750> we've<00:03:12.930> had

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
some of the successes that we've had

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.750 
some of the successes that we've had
they<00:03:13.290> spin<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:13.800> been<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> great<00:03:14.340> great

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
they spin it's been a great great

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.300 
they spin it's been a great great
opportunity<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:15.480> us<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:17.040> help

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
opportunity for us to really really help

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.740 
opportunity for us to really really help
how<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:17.670> areas<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.120> industry<00:03:18.450> where<00:03:18.600> there

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
how in areas of the industry where there

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.080 
how in areas of the industry where there
was<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> demand<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.460> think<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:20.580> when<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> start

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
was a demand I think that when you start

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.880 
was a demand I think that when you start
with<00:03:21.210> capture<00:03:21.570> cards<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.470> really<00:03:22.620> focus

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
with capture cards you you really focus

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
with capture cards you you really focus
in<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.400> area<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.820> you're<00:03:24.000> most

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
in on the area that you're most

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.090 
in on the area that you're most
proficient<00:03:24.989> at<00:03:25.290> which<00:03:25.560> was<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.920> post

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
proficient at which was the post

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.530 
proficient at which was the post
production<00:03:26.280> area<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.209> then<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.510> that

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
production area and then with that

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.410 
production area and then with that
positions<00:03:28.050> like<00:03:28.200> davinci<00:03:28.590> resolve<00:03:29.420> and

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
positions like davinci resolve and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000 
positions like davinci resolve and
office<00:03:30.750> acquisitions<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> a-10

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.710 
office acquisitions with the a-10
production<00:03:32.400> switches<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> then<00:03:33.570> obviously

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
production switches and then obviously

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.840 
production switches and then obviously
more<00:03:34.020> recently<00:03:34.380> with<00:03:34.500> sin<00:03:34.709> tell<00:03:34.950> what<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.670> does

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
more recently with sin tell what it does

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.760 
more recently with sin tell what it does
is<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.000> starts<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.450> open<00:03:36.630> up<00:03:36.900> your<00:03:37.020> imagination

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
is it starts to open up your imagination

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.680 
is it starts to open up your imagination
into<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.400> these<00:03:38.610> new<00:03:38.880> areas<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> can

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
into all of these new areas that you can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.240 
into all of these new areas that you can
you<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.230> take<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.739> exists<00:03:41.100> in

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
you can take that that exists in

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.370 
you can take that that exists in
technology<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.450> emphasize<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.110> or<00:03:43.200> make

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
technology and just emphasize it or make

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.620 
technology and just emphasize it or make
it<00:03:43.410> slightly<00:03:43.680> better<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.340> also<00:03:44.820> as<00:03:45.090> well<00:03:45.270> drop

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
it slightly better but also as well drop

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.810 
it slightly better but also as well drop
on<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.590> attitude<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.250> we've<00:03:47.489> got<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.790> well

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
on this attitude that we've got as well

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.720 
on this attitude that we've got as well
of<00:03:48.500> entering<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.920> entry<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.280> barrier

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
of entering that the entry of barrier

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.130 
of entering that the entry of barrier
really<00:03:51.120> which<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.269> making<00:03:51.720> sure<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.900> its

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
really which is making sure that its

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.350 
really which is making sure that its
most<00:03:52.380> affordable<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.130> everybody<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.760> think

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
most affordable for everybody I think

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.670 
most affordable for everybody I think
that<00:03:54.480> one<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> greatest<00:03:55.080> challenges<00:03:55.560> that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that one of the greatest challenges that

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.050 
that one of the greatest challenges that
you<00:03:55.800> have<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.130> any<00:03:56.250> business<00:03:56.459> when<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.940> or

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
you have in any business when you or

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.729 
you have in any business when you or
make<00:03:57.269> oil<00:03:57.510> your<00:03:57.720> manufacturing<00:03:58.200> products<00:03:58.590> is

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
make oil your manufacturing products is

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.229 
make oil your manufacturing products is
that<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.910> set<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.959> price<00:04:01.080> too<00:04:01.950> high<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.640> that

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
that you set the price too high and that

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.270 
that you set the price too high and that
means<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.660> nobody<00:04:04.350> ever<00:04:04.680> really<00:04:04.950> gets<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
means that nobody ever really gets the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.220 
means that nobody ever really gets the
opportunity<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.850> work<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.330> for<00:04:06.870> us<00:04:07.019> we

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
opportunity to work with it for us we

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.190 
opportunity to work with it for us we
very<00:04:07.500> much<00:04:07.650> hold<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.220> value<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.910> quality<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
very much hold in value the quality the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.870 
very much hold in value the quality the
accessibility<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.190> obviously<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.550> cost

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
accessibility and obviously that cost

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.880 
accessibility and obviously that cost
and<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.630> think<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.050> what<00:04:13.230> what's<00:04:13.739> we're

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
and I think that's what what's we're

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.510 
and I think that's what what's we're
very<00:04:14.130> well<00:04:14.310> for<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.700> really

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
very well for is really

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.400 
very well for is really
one<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.880> problems<00:04:16.360> that<00:04:16.420> you've<00:04:16.660> got<00:04:16.840> when

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
one of the problems that you've got when

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.500 
one of the problems that you've got when
you<00:04:17.560> start<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.100> diversify<00:04:18.700> wildly<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.330> you're

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
you start to diversify wildly as you're

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.600 
you start to diversify wildly as you're
outside<00:04:20.020> your<00:04:20.320> comfort<00:04:20.560> zone<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:21.130> there's<00:04:21.520> a

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
outside your comfort zone and there's a

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.460 
outside your comfort zone and there's a
chance<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:22.060> stuff<00:04:22.240> fall<00:04:22.510> into<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.930> cracks<00:04:23.200> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
chance of stuff fall into the cracks and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.620 
chance of stuff fall into the cracks and
I<00:04:23.890> look<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.700> shipping<00:04:25.060> delays<00:04:25.360> with

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
I look at the the shipping delays with

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.900 
I look at the the shipping delays with
the<00:04:25.750> cameras<00:04:26.140> is<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.320> classic<00:04:26.800> example<00:04:26.890> it<00:04:27.760> was

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
the cameras is a classic example it was

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.610 
the cameras is a classic example it was
something<00:04:28.240> new<00:04:28.420> for<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.750> company<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.320> some

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
something new for the company and some

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.870 
something new for the company and some
of<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.770> cameras<00:04:30.130> took<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.370> whole<00:04:30.550> lot<00:04:30.700> longer

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
of the cameras took a whole lot longer

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.030 
of the cameras took a whole lot longer
to<00:04:31.090> design<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.870> release<00:04:32.140> them<00:04:32.350> were<00:04:32.530> expected

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
to design and release them were expected

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.910 
to design and release them were expected
do<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.670> run<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> risk<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.480> doing<00:04:35.260> too<00:04:35.740> much

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
do you run the risk of doing too much

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.710 
do you run the risk of doing too much
into<00:04:36.280> hundra<00:04:36.460> different<00:04:36.730> areas<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.210> too<00:04:37.570> many

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
into hundra different areas and too many

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.180 
into hundra different areas and too many
plates<00:04:37.960> bouncing<00:04:38.440> at<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.620> same<00:04:38.800> time<00:04:38.980> you

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
plates bouncing at the same time you

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.410 
plates bouncing at the same time you
know<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.550> think<00:04:39.760> it's<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.090> much<00:04:40.120> about

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
know I don't think it's so much about
