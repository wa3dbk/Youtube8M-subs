00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
same price range and I chose this route

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
same price range and I chose this route
mainly<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.550> specialized<00:00:45.120> name<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
have already had in the past plus I just

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
have already had in the past plus I just
liked<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.050> looked<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.219> felt

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
liked the way it looked and and it felt

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250 
liked the way it looked and and it felt
better<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:51.149> when<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.480> test<00:00:51.750> riding<00:00:51.989> them

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.389 
bag here it's great because first off
its<00:01:57.020> magnetic<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> closes

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
its magnetic here so when it closes

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.450 
its magnetic here so when it closes
there's<00:02:00.030> no<00:02:00.180> velcro<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.049> caught<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:02.130> kind

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
there's no velcro to get caught or kind

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.380 
there's no velcro to get caught or kind
of<00:02:02.549> wear<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:02.880> time

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
of wear out over time

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
of wear out over time
I'm<00:02:03.840> sure<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> magnet<00:02:04.469> will<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.610> now<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I'm sure the magnet will but for now it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
I'm sure the magnet will but for now it
just<00:02:06.030> seems<00:02:06.299> much<00:02:06.600> more<00:02:06.810> secure<00:02:07.200> than<00:02:07.229> I've

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
just seems much more secure than I've

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.160 
just seems much more secure than I've
