w.e<00:05:25.910> before<00:05:26.410> kringle<00:05:27.410> ever<00:05:27.560> did<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:29.060> can't

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
w.e before kringle ever did so you can't

w.e before kringle ever did so you can't

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
say it was patented by him but Jack

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.850

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
management and the creative team that he

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.750 
management and the creative team that he
does<00:05:35.690> deserve<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.830> push<00:05:37.070> I'm<00:05:37.430> just<00:05:37.550> saying

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
does deserve the push I'm just saying

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.910 
does deserve the push I'm just saying
and<00:05:38.330> in<00:05:38.480> real<00:05:38.660> life<00:05:38.870> not<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.470> game<00:05:39.650> that

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
and in real life not just the game that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.260 
and in real life not just the game that
I<00:05:39.950> put<00:05:40.220> on<00:05:40.370> for<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.640> this<00:05:40.790> whole<00:05:41.030> match<00:05:41.240> thing

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
I put on for you this whole match thing

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.930 
I put on for you this whole match thing
but<00:05:41.720> he's<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.590> damn<00:05:42.860> good<00:05:42.890> in-ring<00:05:43.280> performer

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
but he's a damn good in-ring performer

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.060 
but he's a damn good in-ring performer
he<00:05:44.390> can't<00:05:44.660> put<00:05:44.840> on<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.960> good<00:05:45.260> match<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.740> think

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
he can't put on a good match so I think

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.330 
he can't put on a good match so I think
he<00:05:46.160> deserves<00:05:46.640> a<00:05:46.820> bit<00:05:47.180> of<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.360> push<00:05:47.600> as<00:05:48.350> does<00:05:48.860> drew

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
he deserves a bit of a push as does drew

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.940 
he deserves a bit of a push as does drew
McIntyre<00:05:49.850> I<00:05:49.880> think<00:05:50.300> they<00:05:50.390> both<00:05:50.420> have<00:05:50.950> well

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
McIntyre I think they both have well

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.070 
McIntyre I think they both have well
drew<00:05:52.130> McIntyre<00:05:52.670> has<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.210> charisma<00:05:53.890> /<00:05:54.890> mic

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
drew McIntyre has the charisma / mic

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.710 
drew McIntyre has the charisma / mic

McIntyre<00:06:04.010> can<00:06:04.250> get<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> while<00:06:04.550> having<00:06:04.760> a

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
McIntyre can get a while having a

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.190 
McIntyre can get a while having a
championship<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.450> not<00:06:05.600> have<00:06:05.780> this<00:06:05.930> whole

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
championship and not have this whole

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.350 
championship and not have this whole
gimmick<00:06:06.860> where<00:06:07.160> he<00:06:07.280> gets<00:06:07.460> fired<00:06:07.640> every<00:06:08.060> week

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
gimmick where he gets fired every week

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.050 
gimmick where he gets fired every week
but<00:06:09.990> uh<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.469> think<00:06:11.189> that<00:06:11.310> it<00:06:11.430> that<00:06:11.699> ends<00:06:12.000> now

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
but uh I think that it that ends now

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.059 
but uh I think that it that ends now
because<00:06:12.479> John<00:06:12.689> Laurinaitis<00:06:13.020> is<00:06:13.349> the<00:06:13.530> general

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
because John Laurinaitis is the general

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.890 
because John Laurinaitis is the general
manager<00:06:14.099> of<00:06:14.550> both<00:06:14.789> Smackdown<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.479> raw<00:06:15.659> so

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
manager of both Smackdown and raw so

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.080 
manager of both Smackdown and raw so
