00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
agility or something not sure but it's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.130 
agility or something not sure but it's
this<00:02:43.320> thing<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.770> raises<00:02:44.250> his<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.330> bunch<00:02:46.020> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
this thing that raises his be a bunch of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.650 
this thing that raises his be a bunch of
time<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.710> he'll<00:02:46.920> do<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.240> think<00:02:48.540> it's

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
chance okay but I think this is the way

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
chance okay but I think this is the way
of<00:04:01.470> how<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:01.980> use<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.550> how<00:04:02.700> her<00:04:02.910> pokemon<00:04:03.420> I've

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750

but<00:04:07.200> some<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.220> milotic<00:04:08.940> gets<00:04:09.360> hard<00:04:09.660> because

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
but some the milotic gets hard because

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.800 
but some the milotic gets hard because
that<00:04:10.440> Garchomp<00:04:11.250> Garchomp<00:04:11.579> will<00:04:12.209> be<00:04:12.329> us

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
that Garchomp Garchomp will be us

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.009 
that Garchomp Garchomp will be us
no<00:04:13.080> matter<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.920> high<00:04:14.520> level<00:04:14.880> 50<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.360> 60<00:04:15.810> would

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
no matter like high level 50 to 60 would

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.240 
no matter like high level 50 to 60 would
be<00:04:16.230> just<00:04:16.620> fine<00:04:17.150> for<00:04:18.150> Garchomp<00:04:18.750> but<00:04:19.049> some<00:04:19.350> that

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
be just fine for Garchomp but some that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.760 
be just fine for Garchomp but some that
my<00:04:20.400> load<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.970> be<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.480> hassle<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.530> I

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
my load it can be a hassle because I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.100 
my load it can be a hassle because I
think<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.160> has<00:04:23.250> good<00:04:23.580> d<00:04:23.820> senses<00:04:24.330> which<00:04:24.870> means

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
think it has good d senses which means
