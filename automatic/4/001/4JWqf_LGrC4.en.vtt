 Of course not everyone can go in a 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.280

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.650
 chatting uncle is silly uncle I feel 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.650
 very dear 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.799
 there is one thing that does tense me 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.839
 driving but it's not in the truck it's 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.239
 when you have to stop to refuel and it's because 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.820
 wrong in the fuel to see your 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.010
 vehicle you're wrong to build it 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.470
 it annoys because if you give him a with a bat 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.439
 of baseball or the crashes against a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.450
 stone that you throw it from an eighth floor 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.280
 you get in and the engine starts, look sometimes 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.259
 but but if you throw the fuel 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.509
 wrong others melt is like the 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.310
 Kryptonite of the engines wrong 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.900
 fuel and you will tell me and how is it 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 possible that you are mistaken for fuel 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.720
 and leave a little time that I you 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.060
 you will say and to tell me this 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.800
 estimate then I can go wrong 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.659
 because I have a disease 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:43.460
 they forget things is called d syndrome 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 I'll say it of course, I do not have the syndrome, 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.009
 would like a mnemonic how is it called 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.740
 Virgin is the patron saint of Catalonia 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 who call her the moreneta as she is called 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 keep it is or montserrat if 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 I was here in Montserrat woman 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.590
 I could remember what it's called 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.020
 syndrome that is because she does it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.820
 know but I do not remember so what 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.740
 I've done is tattooed the name of the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 fuel so that the fuel that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.310
 use I have it here tattooed either about 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.450

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.450

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.940
 Gas station, well, it's full of things 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.709
