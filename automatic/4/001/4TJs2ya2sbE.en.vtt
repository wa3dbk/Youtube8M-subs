00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
would say that the storyline is pretty

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.300 
would say that the storyline is pretty
good<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.289> really<00:04:40.470> funny<00:04:40.710> there's<00:04:41.130> all

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
good it's really funny there's all

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.159 
good it's really funny there's all
dynamics<00:04:41.910> where<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.660> don't<00:04:43.050> know

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
dynamics where it's just I don't know

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.779 
dynamics where it's just I don't know
the<00:04:43.320> characters<00:04:43.650> do<00:04:43.830> little<00:04:44.160> silly<00:04:44.610> little

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
the characters do little silly little

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.460 
the characters do little silly little
things<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.509> think<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:45.990> first<00:04:46.229> one

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
things and I think this is the first one

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.839 
things and I think this is the first one
where<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.830> characters<00:04:47.009> actually<00:04:47.550> talk

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
where the characters actually talk

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:54.320 
where the characters actually talk
because<00:04:48.780> we've<00:04:49.139> got<00:04:51.349> this<00:04:52.349> well<00:04:53.130> oh<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:54.180> one

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
because we've got this well oh this one

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.219 
because we've got this well oh this one
is<00:04:54.449> like<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.599> first<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.050> where<00:04:55.139> they

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
is like the first one where they

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.480 
is like the first one where they
actually<00:04:55.380> talk<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.070> rest<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
actually talk is on the rest of the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.279 
actually talk is on the rest of the
series<00:04:56.820> they<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:57.180> make<00:04:57.780> little<00:04:58.050> noises
