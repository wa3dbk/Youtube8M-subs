00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.540
 the european adventure of the last few years brought ajax into stadiums as a camp 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.939
 well old trafford and san siro 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.779
 but this time it is different instead of a large arena with room for it 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.699
 The team plays 50,000 spectators for 6,000 people on Thursday evening 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 beach stadium india rewards 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 it is the fate of a team that no longer has a chance at the champions league 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.039
 but has been sentenced to the preliminary round of the Europa League according to Frank de Boer 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 however, it makes little difference in terms of ambiance 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.920
 of course it is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.770
 nice if you play a new big stadium according to the mdi san siro 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.930
 but that this is so there is one is completely full, the frieze is just one 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 great atmosphere 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380
 the field also feels good 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.160
 where are all the ingredients to one 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.540
 he didn't notice a very serious train 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.890
 underestimate because they are all minorities 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 would have tension to keep the thing so that the store 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.989
 we all realize very well 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.550
 what matters here 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 the importance is indeed great 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.570
 if things go wrong, ajax will be missing in the group phase of for the first time since 2007 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.830
 the european tournament for young team is a bad development 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 it's just very good cause 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120
 play matches 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.420
 against other cultures 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.530
 play many matches in a week 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 where just get better from the experience getting richer and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 so yes we just have to make this one 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.390
 just the talented player 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.980
 2 in that grid and promotes another it actually stands with a year played year 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.190
 otherwise we just have to be the duo 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.100
 it is not good for a potpourri in development aid, so also for the team 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.680
 there is more than a chance that the farmer will choose the same set-up on Thursday 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 as in the home duel with jablonec 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.390
 although the game was not spectacular in that match in recent weeks either 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.120
 note the ajax a series of crew results 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.410
 because the team is doing well 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.290
 four times three times over this year 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.970
 one that also gives confidence 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.349
 you feel because the team is getting worse 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.879
 just carry on 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.979
 in the last few weeks more and more linked to each other 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.439
 think in the results 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.019
 and of course a romantic dissolution and better 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.659
 with 2 0 of 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.929
 it gives confidence 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.139
 according to 24 hours sure to report ds 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.019
 in the series of matches 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.629
 to be on the program 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.290
 switching off on an annual basis is enough for ajax to reset to zero 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.969
 to hold 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.109
 it is therefore the question with what intention the team the which 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.929
 enter 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.259
 who you shouldn't be thinking about, you shouldn't be naive 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.699
 and we will just try to play our own game 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.209
 so just maybe more busy ahead of that moment not say but in 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.539
 get their game so maybe they can put the big striker the man 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.399
 credit 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.569
 just in this case 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.909
 the previous one will have to deliver much longer in order not to play football that easily 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.999
 can give that are already easy to give to 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.519
 especially 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.559
 that expansion will have to be delivered to others and that is possible 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.139
 perhaps it is known that the working conditions act now knows more about the way in which 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.339
 Ajax meets the Czechs Thursday 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.339
 During the training, several dream ship flew laps above the stadium 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.929
 who she is managing this is not known, but it is certain that Thursday in the warm you 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.939
 with metz all means are allowed to make it to the next round
