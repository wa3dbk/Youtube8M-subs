a<00:00:44.040> disc<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.700> show<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> 21<00:00:45.750> grams<00:00:46.110> okay<00:00:47.210> now<00:00:48.210> I've

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
a disc and show a 21 grams okay now I've

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
a disc and show a 21 grams okay now I've
had<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> few<00:00:48.809> dumplings<00:00:49.230> before<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.129> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
had a few dumplings before so I'm just

had a few dumplings before so I'm just
guessing<00:00:50.760> it'll<00:00:51.390> pop<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> down<00:00:51.840> oh<00:00:57.739> that<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
guessing it'll pop it down oh that is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
guessing it'll pop it down oh that is

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like an exploding package of soup in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
like an exploding package of soup in
your<00:01:01.140> mouth<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:02.609> has<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
your mouth that is there has to be a

your mouth that is there has to be a
better<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:03.510> what's<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> way<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> eat<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.280 

plop<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> down

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.800 

Oh<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.860> by<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:17.729> pour<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
Oh see by the side a little bit pour it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.870 
Oh see by the side a little bit pour it
into<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> try<00:01:20.790> his<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.270 

so<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:25.970> bite<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.300> little<00:01:26.510> hole<00:01:26.660> on<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.840> side

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
so you bite the little hole on the side

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.200 
so you bite the little hole on the side
pour<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.370> out<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.090> drink<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> soup<00:01:33.790> now

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.640 

for<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.360> second<00:01:38.900> bite<00:01:39.050> that's<00:01:39.260> more<00:01:39.470> like<00:01:39.590> a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
for the second bite that's more like a

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.650 
for the second bite that's more like a
traditional<00:01:39.830> dumpling<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:40.790> still<00:01:41.120> even<00:01:41.390> that

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
traditional dumpling but still even that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.690 
traditional dumpling but still even that
without<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.200> soup<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.560> suck<00:01:42.770> taste<00:01:43.310> miles

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
without the soup and suck taste miles

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.940 
without the soup and suck taste miles
above<00:01:44.119> many<00:01:44.450> other<00:01:44.660> dumplings<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.260> skin<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:45.920> a

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
above many other dumplings the skin as a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.130 
above many other dumplings the skin as a
soft<00:01:46.430> delicate<00:01:46.820> nature<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.810> really

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
soft delicate nature which is really

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.359 
soft delicate nature which is really
much<00:01:48.320> different<00:01:48.680> than<00:01:48.740> most<00:01:48.890> stumblings

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
much different than most stumblings

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.920 
much different than most stumblings
there's<00:01:49.520> kind<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.700> more<00:01:49.850> chewy<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.330> different

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
there's kind of more chewy a different

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.200 
there's kind of more chewy a different
kind<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.110> texture<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.790> amazing<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.180> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
kind of texture that is amazing it's the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.570 
kind of texture that is amazing it's the
kind<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.450> one-two<00:01:53.900> punch<00:01:54.170> approach<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.400> what

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
kind of one-two punch approach so what

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.600 
kind of one-two punch approach so what
is<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.030> second<00:01:56.509> way<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.310> take<00:02:01.490> your

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
is the second way so you take your

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.710 
is the second way so you take your
dumpling<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.030> put<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.270> down<00:02:02.390> into<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
dumpling and you put it down into the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.990 
dumpling and you put it down into the
mild<00:02:03.020> vinegar<00:02:03.470> sauce<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.340> plug<00:02:04.610> some<00:02:04.880> of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
mild vinegar sauce and you plug some of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.730 
mild vinegar sauce and you plug some of
this<00:02:05.119> ginger<00:02:05.509> which<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.869> new<00:02:06.170> ginger<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.710> top

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
this ginger which is new ginger on top

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.469 
this ginger which is new ginger on top
so<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.759> nice<00:02:07.910> little<00:02:08.209> kind<00:02:08.390> of

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
so you have a nice little kind of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.080 
so you have a nice little kind of
balance<00:02:08.869> between<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:10.190> pop<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.790> in

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.670 

now<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:17.780> those<00:02:17.870> two<00:02:18.050> different<00:02:18.140> ways<00:02:18.380> eating

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
now with those two different ways eating

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.839 
now with those two different ways eating
it<00:02:18.800> there<00:02:19.040> are<00:02:19.099> two<00:02:19.250> entirely<00:02:19.670> different

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
it there are two entirely different

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.240 
it there are two entirely different
pieces<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.620> know<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.860> first<00:02:22.069> way

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
pieces like that you know the first way

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.920 
pieces like that you know the first way
