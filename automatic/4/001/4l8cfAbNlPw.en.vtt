00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.240
 how to take care begonias the begonias are a 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.309
 genus of plants that consist of more than 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.010
 thousand species and about ten thousand varieties 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.560
 some hybrids are grown for 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.480
 get a colorful foliage other by 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.940
 its flowers that some people value 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.860
 both species can be 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.960
 cultivate successfully as plants 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.600
 inside but some are also 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.000
 able to live outside fortunately 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.190
 for begonias producers despite 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.559
 of diversity and gender care 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.720
 of all the begonias is similar now 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.510
 we will explain the instructions for 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.300
 take care of them the begonias should be able to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.309
 Enjoy the bright sunlight to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.399
 through a window facing east 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.610
 or to the south to the begonias cultivated by 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.950
 its foliage as the begonias rex light 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.559
 it should not be direct but rather 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.300
 filtered by a transparent curtain or 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.760
 by the shadow of a tree outside the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.610
 window the cultivation of begonias by 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.180
 bloom however you will need several 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.320
 hours of direct sun every day 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.930
 provide a stable temperature 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 for the begonias the begonias are 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 sensitive 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.480
 the rapid temperature fluctuations 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.910
 and therefore they should stay away from 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.950
 drafts as long as the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.680
 temperature is constant and above 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 from 18 degrees the begonias can 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.780
 prosper irrigate the begonias between a 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 once a week and once every two 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.760
 weeks the issue of irrigation in begonia 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 it's important because too much water 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.650
 can cause plants to rot 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.170
 monitor the moisture of the earth when 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.050
 you put your finger on the ground and do not notice 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.330
 humidity is the time to water with 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.979
 begonias in small pots the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.320
 begonias have root systems 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.720
 small and do not need transplants with 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.420
 however, every spring 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.550
 you should look at the roots and check if 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.070
 these have completely enveloped the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.950
 lower part of the pot if so 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.100
 better to change it to a pot a little more 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.140
 large bears the flowering begonias 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.470
 outdoors during the months of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.540
 spring summer and autumn if possible 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.269
 create the right conditions for 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.069
 they the begonias with flowers enjoy 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.870
 a porch with shadow always 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.900
 and when the temperature does not drop below 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.319
 18 degrees the begonias that grow out 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.239
 they need more frequent watering so 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.969
 Be careful to check the ground more 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.700
 often the begonias are flowers 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.920
 versatile that are commonly found 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.769
 as indoor plants in the beds 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840

 the baskets of the houses are very 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.299
 popular both for their attractive 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.489
 flowers as for their leaves that are either 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.269
 of indoor since they are highly 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.269
