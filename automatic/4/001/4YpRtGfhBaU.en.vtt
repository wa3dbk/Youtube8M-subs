00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pretty confusing or at least I thought

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.760 
pretty confusing or at least I thought
it<00:01:48.660> did<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:50.240> when<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.390> loose<00:01:51.600> these<00:01:52.470> little

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it did and when it's loose these little

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.890 
it did and when it's loose these little
guys<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.310> they'll<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.670> moving<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
guys in here they'll be moving a lot you

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.800 
guys in here they'll be moving a lot you
can<00:01:55.080> just<00:01:55.530> move<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.800> around<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.540> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
can just move them around but and so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
can just move them around but and so
when<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:58.890> putting<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.400> nut<00:01:59.580> on<00:01:59.759> you're

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
when you're putting the nut on you're

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
when you're putting the nut on you're
going<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.390> want<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> hold<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.050> place<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
going to want to hold it in place so it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.820 
going to want to hold it in place so it
doesn't<00:02:02.520> move<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.270> push<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.229> far<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
doesn't move and push it as far up as it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.770 
doesn't move and push it as far up as it
can<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:08.179> let<00:02:09.179> me<00:02:09.269> get<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
can go and then let me get it in the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
can go and then let me get it in the
camera<00:02:10.470> once<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.790> moving

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
camera once it's not moving

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.410 
camera once it's not moving
you<00:02:12.660> screw<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> nut<00:02:13.290> back<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.700> once<00:02:15.239> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you screw the nut back on and once it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.660 
you screw the nut back on and once it's
tight<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:17.160> well<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:18.060> obviously<00:02:18.480> tight<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
tight it well it's obviously tight and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.630 
tight it well it's obviously tight and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.150 
on I know it doesn't sound hard but you
have<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.959> line<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> other<00:02:31.739> ones

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
have to line it up with the other ones

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.360 
have to line it up with the other ones
make<00:02:32.519> sure<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.540> way<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.070> turn<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.190> all

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
make sure the way I do it turn it all

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.729 
make sure the way I do it turn it all
the<00:02:35.430> way<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.060> left<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.440> turn<00:02:37.620> all

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the way to the left and I just turn all

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
the way to the left and I just turn all
mine<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> left<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.730> usually<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> zero

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
mine to the left and usually the zero

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.850 
mine to the left and usually the zero
points<00:02:40.500> straight<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.829> on<00:02:41.160> line<00:02:41.820> anyway<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
points straight up on line anyway and so

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.960 
points straight up on line anyway and so
I<00:02:44.130> turn<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.269> over<00:02:46.220> find<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> zero<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I turn this over find the zero on the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.190 
I turn this over find the zero on the
knob<00:02:48.180> right<00:02:48.750> up<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:50.390> put<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:51.989> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
knob right up here I put it on so it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.970 
knob right up here I put it on so it
faces<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:53.930> push<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.079> down<00:02:55.110> right

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
faces up and I just push it down right

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.650 
faces up and I just push it down right
as<00:02:56.420> hard<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.970> that's<00:02:59.970> how<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.329> fix

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
as hard as I can and that's how you fix

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.229 
as hard as I can and that's how you fix
it<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.489> do<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.790> put<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> back

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
it all you got to do is put the back

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.940 
it all you got to do is put the back
back<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.100> done<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.739> that's<00:03:07.739> also

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
how you change knobs you just pull them

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.830 
how you change knobs you just pull them
off<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.200> another<00:03:10.980> one<00:03:11.100> put<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> back<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:13.549> so
