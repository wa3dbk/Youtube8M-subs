00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we want to change for example we pop a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.540 
we want to change for example we pop a
trigger<00:00:28.349> level<00:00:28.529> where<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.340> alert<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.910> sound

trigger level where an alert would sound

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
trigger level where an alert would sound
we<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.579> simply<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.420> sort<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.870> adding<00:00:34.710> or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
we can simply do sort of by adding or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
we can simply do sort of by adding or
entering<00:00:35.370> editing<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> number<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.010> we

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
entering editing the number so if we

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
entering editing the number so if we
want<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> alert<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> trigger<00:00:39.090> when<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.620> RSI

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
as you can see if we want to change the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.250 
as you can see if we want to change the
sound<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> our<00:00:54.000> silo<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:54.960> any

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
sound for the our silo we can use any

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.680 
sound for the our silo we can use any
sound<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.430> sounds<00:00:57.090> folder<00:00:57.539> in

sound which is in our sounds folder in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
sound which is in our sounds folder in
mt4<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.270> our<00:01:00.739> sound<00:01:01.739> folder<00:01:02.420> go

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.830 
mt4 so if we look at our sound folder go
see<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.519> Program<00:01:06.000> Files<00:01:06.030> mine's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
see it will be in Program Files mine's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually in US as another directory but

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
actually in US as another directory but
don't<00:01:09.210> worry<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.590> it'll<00:01:10.710> be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
don't worry about that so it'll be

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
don't worry about that so it'll be

so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> look<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> name<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.530> broker

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
so you look for the name of your broker

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.520 
so you look for the name of your broker
go<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.689> sales<00:01:19.049> file<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:21.320> any<00:01:22.320> of

go down to your sales file and any of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.300 
go down to your sales file and any of
these<00:01:22.680> sounds<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.640> used<00:01:23.970> within<00:01:25.310> the

these sounds can be used within the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240 
these sounds can be used within the
indicator<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> an<00:01:28.350> indicator<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
indicator as it is an indicator the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.240 
indicator as it is an indicator the
sound<00:01:29.520> file<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.540> short

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
sound file will have to be short

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
sound file will have to be short
otherwise<00:01:32.270> it'll<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.509> clipped<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> next

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
otherwise it'll get clipped on the next

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.359 
otherwise it'll get clipped on the next
tick<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.880> short<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:37.380> short<00:01:37.470> sound<00:01:38.070> files

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
tick so use short very short sound files

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.510 
tick so use short very short sound files
so<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.390> example<00:01:39.780> I've<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:41.070> called<00:01:41.250> beep

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so for example I've got one called beep

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
so for example I've got one called beep
one<00:01:41.820> called<00:01:42.030> tick<00:01:42.329> okay<00:01:42.600> let's<00:01:43.020> try<00:01:43.110> beat<00:01:43.439> for

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
one called tick okay let's try beat for

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
one called tick okay let's try beat for
example<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.729> look<00:01:45.000> through<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
example if we just look through here and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060 
example if we just look through here and
we're<00:01:45.600> taking<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.990> couple<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.500> mental<00:01:46.860> notes

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
we're taking a couple of mental notes

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.139 
we're taking a couple of mental notes
about<00:01:47.340> what's<00:01:47.579> available

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
about what's available

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
about what's available
these<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.930> very<00:01:49.079> quick<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.680> quite

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
these are all very quick these are quite

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
these are all very quick these are quite
long<00:01:50.869> alerts

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

an<00:02:14.560> example<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> tick<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.960> beep

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
an example of a tick and the beep

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.730 
an example of a tick and the beep
notice<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.420> casing<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:19.990> well<00:02:20.170> that's<00:02:20.560> what

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
notice the casing as well that's what

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.430 
notice the casing as well that's what
this<00:02:20.860> case<00:02:21.130> sensitive<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.140> let's<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.320> go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
this case sensitive so let's just go

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.620 
this case sensitive so let's just go
back<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.920> configure<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.520> indicator<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.510> we

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
back and configure the indicator and we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.780 
back and configure the indicator and we
use<00:02:26.130> beep<00:02:27.130> first<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:30.190> worth<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
use beep first of all be worth it so

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.580 
use beep first of all be worth it so

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
beep to tick again case sensitive so you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.759 
beep to tick again case sensitive so you

and led to a file you like because you
can<00:04:26.790> actually<00:04:27.240> slow<00:04:27.510> down<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.080> program

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
can actually slow down the program

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.560 
can actually slow down the program
control<00:04:30.210> using<00:04:31.070> sleep<00:04:32.070> commands<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.360> with

control using sleep commands but with

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.430 
control using sleep commands but with

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
indicators you can't you can't slow them

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.190 
indicators you can't you can't slow them
so<00:04:37.700> make<00:04:38.700> sure<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:39.090> any<00:04:39.270> web<00:04:39.480> files<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.960> use
