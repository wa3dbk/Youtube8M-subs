00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.850
 therefore water and lemon is a 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.980
 a remedy that is often recommended 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.500
 to drink just in the morning on an empty stomach for 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.330
 who has various various functions and comes from 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.960
 a little from the oriental medicine 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.210
 also of Ayurvedic medicine because 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.820
 turns out to be behaves a bit like 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.430
 a kind of internal washing shower 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.350
 Intestinal crate useful because it goes to 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 remove all the residues 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.059
 of the acids of the night for which it is 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.360
 how to take a shower inside the lemon is 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.400
 a fruit very rich in vitamins 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.309
 minerals we think of vitamin C is for 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.519
 example and continues at about 50 mg each 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.559
 100 grams lemon vitamin c 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.559
 but are also present for example the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.909
 potassium phosphorus vitamin b1 and la 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.080
 characteristic is the presence of acids 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.780
 organic like acid citric acid 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.640
 malic and these organic acids are 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.830
 those that interest us to speak a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.560
 bit of this acidity thing 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.799
 lemon and acid you can drink lemon 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.549
 if for example there is a gastritis or if if 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.549
 there is gastric hyperacidity 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.430
 in reality yes because the thing happens in the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.500
 time when organic acids then 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.500
 composer days and precisely from acid 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.570
 malic citric acid come into 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.539
 contact with alkaline metals the body 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.210
 happens that carbonates are formed and 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.850
 bicarbonates then these bicarbonates 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.859
 as you know they have a basic action 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.140
 therefore alkalizing therefore in reality 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:02:00.140
 in this sense it is the lemon although a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.329
 this little sour taste but not 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 it has nothing to do with the with the ph then 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.189
 this reputation for being acid and more 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.080
 linked to the taste the own lemon 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.650
 for the formation of these bicarbonates 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.930
 turns out to be a food 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 alkalizing 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.829
 useful for example in case of iter 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.500
 gastric acidity 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.500
 because the formation of 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.379
 bicarbonates goes to basics poking and a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.640
 counteract the production action of 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.269
 hydrochloric acid 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.579
 it is clear that first of all the advice is 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.420
 to start with small with small 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.879
 doses 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.760
 maybe it could be taken at the beginning 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.700
 a quarter of fresh lemon juice 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.500
 in a little water then move on then 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.510
 three quarters up to one e 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.510
 see what happens so it is 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.819
 important how to say start in a way 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.930
 gradual 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.930
 another important thing 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.340
 how to say another property that that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.719
 water and lemon a is that a bit of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.030
 turn on and wake up the 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.250
 metabolism because citric acid is a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.560
 component of the krebs cycle for which 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.450
 activates the metabolism drink water e 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.819
 lemon in the morning is a bit like taking 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.549
 the coffee so why own cc 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.290
 wake up try and let me know why it is 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.510
 really so many patients do not have 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.690
 reportedly then they will do without the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.840
 coffee is the last thing of citric acid 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.359
 is that it favors the absorption of the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.780
 intestinal calcium for which 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:35.109
 it is also remineralizing is 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 clearly you have to try and go 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.079
 gradually without exceeding without doing 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 45 lemons and all together in short 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.199
 finally I add that it is important not 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.139
 put boiling water just because 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:52.419
 would go like saying the disappear 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.699
 vitamin C content that is 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.409
 thermolabile so I still recommend a 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.930
 warm water 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.790
 maybe 30 degrees hop at a temperature 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.040
 environment I sincerely take it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.069
 slightly warm with a lemon 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.069
 squeezed
