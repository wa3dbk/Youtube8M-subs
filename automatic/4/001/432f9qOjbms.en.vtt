00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.860 
me this was a gift you know it's one of
those<00:01:39.860> items<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.550> no<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.450> don't<00:01:41.660> really

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
those items that no you don't really

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.650 
those items that no you don't really
need<00:01:42.340> especially<00:01:43.340> in<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.520> Manhattan<00:01:43.670> sighs<00:01:44.240> you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
need especially in a Manhattan sighs you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.780 
need especially in a Manhattan sighs you
know<00:01:44.750> kitchen<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:46.010> really<00:01:46.430> like<00:01:46.580> creme

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
know kitchen but I really like creme

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.610 
know kitchen but I really like creme
brulee<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.420> was<00:01:47.660> really<00:01:47.900> excited<00:01:48.140> about<00:01:48.440> it

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
brulee and I was really excited about it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.040 
brulee and I was really excited about it
so<00:01:48.800> this<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.610> obviously<00:01:49.820> not<00:01:50.300> a<00:01:50.360> restaurant

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
so this is obviously not a restaurant

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.920 
so this is obviously not a restaurant
style<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:52.160> know<00:01:52.280> torch<00:01:52.640> those<00:01:53.180> are<00:01:53.360> quite<00:01:53.600> big

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
style you know torch those are quite big

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.660 
style you know torch those are quite big
and<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:54.200> really<00:01:54.620> give<00:01:54.770> off<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> large<00:01:55.280> flame

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
and they really give off a large flame

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.790 
and they really give off a large flame
but<00:01:56.180> whatever<00:01:56.510> kind<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.840> torch<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.320> have<00:01:57.530> just

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
but whatever kind of torch you have just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.310 
but whatever kind of torch you have just
make<00:01:57.950> sure<00:01:58.130> you're<00:01:58.580> using<00:01:58.940> your<00:01:59.720> ultimate

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
make sure you're using your ultimate

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.010 
make sure you're using your ultimate
highest<00:02:00.620> flame<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.520> can<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.750> use<00:02:02.990> a

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
highest flame that you can if you use a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.500 
highest flame that you can if you use a
low<00:02:03.440> flame<00:02:03.860> you'll<00:02:04.460> still<00:02:04.760> eventually<00:02:05.240> get<00:02:05.420> to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
low flame you'll still eventually get to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.510 
low flame you'll still eventually get to
the<00:02:05.630> same<00:02:05.870> final<00:02:06.410> product<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.310> you'll<00:02:07.460> be

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
the same final product but you'll be

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.730 
the same final product but you'll be
warming<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.390> almost<00:02:08.750> cooking<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.320> custard

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
warming and almost cooking that custard

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.630 
warming and almost cooking that custard
because<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.160> take<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.520> much

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
because it's going to take so much

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.520 
because it's going to take so much
longer<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.330> then<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:11.990> going<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.200> become<00:02:12.350> a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
longer and then it's going to become a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.350 
longer and then it's going to become a
little<00:02:12.710> bit<00:02:12.830> warm<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.120> so

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
little bit warm and it's just not so

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.970 
little bit warm and it's just not so
great<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.440> want<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.650> use<00:02:15.800> our

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
great so we really want to use our

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.920 
great so we really want to use our
highest<00:02:16.400> flame<00:02:16.640> possible<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:17.600> I'm<00:02:17.720> going<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
highest flame possible now I'm going to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
highest flame possible now I'm going to
go<00:02:17.990> over<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.470> once<00:02:18.830> give<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> good<00:02:19.520> pass

and then let it all kind of settle back

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.190 
and then let it all kind of settle back
down<00:02:22.070> see<00:02:22.850> where<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.540> then<00:02:23.900> I'm<00:02:24.050> gonna

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.510 
go over it again if you get a couple of
burn<00:02:26.750> spots<00:02:27.140> that's<00:02:27.500> okay<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:27.950> bitterness

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
brulee every now and then it might just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.010 
brulee every now and then it might just
be<00:03:13.890> something<00:03:13.980> fun<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.750> now<00:03:15.900> we're

be something fun to have so now we're
going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.560> our<00:03:16.709> broiler<00:03:17.220> method

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
going to have on to our broiler method

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.100 
going to have on to our broiler method
we're<00:03:17.819> going<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> same<00:03:18.390> thing<00:03:18.750> put<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
we're going to do the same thing put the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.990 
we're going to do the same thing put the
same<00:03:19.290> amount<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.620> sugar<00:03:19.800> on<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.130> top<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
same amount of sugar on the top and the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.880 
same amount of sugar on the top and the
trick<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.569> just<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.140> put<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.410> as<00:03:22.500> close<00:03:22.860> to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
trick here is just to put it as close to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.000 
trick here is just to put it as close to
your<00:03:23.250> broiler<00:03:23.459> flame<00:03:24.120> as<00:03:24.450> possible<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:25.739> some

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
your broiler flame as possible now some

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.380 
your broiler flame as possible now some
people<00:03:26.099> have<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.760> broiler<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
people have you know a broiler on the

top of the bottom there's a lot of

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.830 
top of the bottom there's a lot of
different<00:03:29.340> stoves<00:03:29.580> out<00:03:29.819> there<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.599> want

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
different stoves out there you just want

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.120 
different stoves out there you just want
to<00:03:30.870> make<00:03:31.050> sure<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.290> try<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.769> as<00:03:31.860> close

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
to make sure you try to get it as close

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.620 
to make sure you try to get it as close
to<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.310> flame<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:32.760> possible<00:03:33.239> because<00:03:33.420> we're

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
to the flame as possible because we're

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.360 
to the flame as possible because we're
trying<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.080> recreate<00:03:34.500> what<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.010> did<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
trying to recreate what we did with the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
trying to recreate what we did with the
first<00:03:35.519> one<00:03:35.700> trying<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.049> it's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
first one trying to get it so that it's

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.250 
first one trying to get it so that it's
almost<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.950> flame<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.700> top<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.959> if

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
almost the flame is on top of it now if

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.600 
almost the flame is on top of it now if
you<00:03:40.380> think<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.769> whatever<00:03:40.920> reason<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
you think for whatever reason that you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.100 
you think for whatever reason that you
don't<00:03:41.819> think<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.239> can<00:03:42.330> get<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> very<00:03:42.810> close<00:03:42.989> to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110

don't think you can get it very close to
your<00:03:43.410> flame<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.980> think<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.220> going<00:03:44.340> to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
your flame and you think it's going to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.670 
your flame and you think it's going to
take<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.610> couple<00:03:44.850> minutes<00:03:45.030> longer<00:03:45.480> then<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.319> want
