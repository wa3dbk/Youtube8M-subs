00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.640
 to school when you want to go on holiday 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 when it suits you and learn via your own 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.010
 tablet computer 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.900
 seems like a fairy tale but after the summer 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 10 schools start with it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 initiator maurice the dog gets the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 so-called steve jobs school to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 Netherlands and gives them their own name 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 oh oh 4 and tea that stands for education 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 for the new age 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.689
 now the children of group are once one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.029
 of the compass in Meppel 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 to play and to clay 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 but the transition to tablet education 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 is clearly visible here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.050
 next school year this will be at least on 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 10 schools in the Netherlands 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 the norm you can look up you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.320
 can train yourself you can work together 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 making and communicating papers 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 The nice thing is if you use this device properly 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 You can use the school you attend 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 each other especially use for the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 social interaction and for the emotional 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.039
 development together that is badger 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 a tablet at school is not a novelty 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.559
 the plan dog alder than many 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.180
 more 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.550
 all children have their own tablet 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 which they may also take home and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 there is a permanent classroom of your own teacher 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 no longer daycare and school 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 flowing into one another because of the building 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.510
 is just open all day and the parents 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.369
 and, moreover, no longer tied to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 fixed school holidays you decide yourself 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 when the image is out for much school 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.299
 this transition a bit too rigorous we 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.009
 are a school that an existing one 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.840
 organization and a change of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.390
 school organization and culture and there is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 a change process that you gradually get 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 must develop 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.290
 you can't go from one to the other 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.479
 with 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.579
 passes than he can as older or younger 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.829
 old karwan for so you would a school 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.390
 want those flexible open hours 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.610
 has stuff and stuff but you can already 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 questioning especially the de 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 emphasis placed on technologies 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560
 the ipad as the starting point of it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.070
 Education 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.290
 what you are doing 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 but we can no longer avoid it 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.740
 tablet will soon be the basis of it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 education applications within it 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 materials and there is even an app 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.229
 Which also includes the results that looks 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.050
 then so that you are for every child 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.760
 can keep track of what is working on an app 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.800
 what he did all the levels 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.600
 although I achieved level and you can do it 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.610
 even matched results for one 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.229
 other children like the us a sentence 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.039
 actually goes the whole education 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.270
 on the shovel 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.990
 the books disappear from the classrooms 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.790
 but also the classical teachers there 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.570
 needs a modern teacher for the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.080
 come instead 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.180
 to mind is that you are often still 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 very centrally taught 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.660
 the teachers explains something in all 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.700
 children are going to do rapper the same 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.700
 and become the soon to happen is that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.580
 children go from the ipad much more 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.040
 work and then the the role of the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.140
 teacher was filming his cold than 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.730
 really the frontal teacher who for the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.410
 class and that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.570
 turns the education inspectorate 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 has already given the green light to the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.370
 start in August up to one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.370
