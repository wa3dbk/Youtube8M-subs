00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
we're going to use this big issue

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.570 
we're going to use this big issue
cluster<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:40.570> it's<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.870> solid<00:00:41.170> stamp<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.400> whole

cluster and it's a solid stamp the whole

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.970 
cluster and it's a solid stamp the whole
stamp<00:00:42.970> will<00:00:43.120> stamp<00:00:43.390> down<00:00:43.629> okay<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.379> this<00:00:44.650> is

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
stamp will stamp down okay and this is

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:55.079 
stamp will stamp down okay and this is
the<00:00:46.320> type<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.350> effect<00:00:53.580> so<00:00:54.580> we're<00:00:54.699> going<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.909> do

the type of effect so we're going to do

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.479 
the type of effect so we're going to do
what<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.449> call<00:00:55.659> shadow<00:00:56.110> stamping<00:00:56.710> they're

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
what I call shadow stamping they're

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.100 
what I call shadow stamping they're
going<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.760> add<00:00:57.879> some<00:00:58.059> ink<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.570> then<00:00:58.930> we're

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
up a solid stamp you have to be a bit

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.960 
up a solid stamp you have to be a bit
more<00:02:52.050> careful<00:02:52.350> when<00:02:52.739> you're<00:02:52.890> inking<00:02:53.250> up<00:02:53.370> again

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
more careful when you're inking up again

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.750 
more careful when you're inking up again
you<00:02:54.120> still<00:02:54.510> don't<00:02:55.170> need<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you still don't need to do this but you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
you still don't need to do this but you
just<00:02:56.790> need<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.420> press<00:02:57.690> firmly<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.500> ensure

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
just need to press firmly and ensure

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.130 
just need to press firmly and ensure
that<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.640> get<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.880> ink<00:03:00.440> everywhere

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that you get the ink everywhere

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.300 
that you get the ink everywhere
round<00:03:04.140> because<00:03:04.350> again<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> always<00:03:04.980> seem<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
round because again I always seem to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
round because again I always seem to
work<00:03:05.520> upside<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.050> you're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
work upside down and when you're

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
where you can then go to town because

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:29.429 
where you can then go to town because

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
work your way around now I normally only

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.939 
work your way around now I normally only
do<00:06:38.709> though<00:06:39.009> what<00:06:39.879> I<00:06:39.909> would<00:06:40.179> call<00:06:40.389> the<00:06:40.599> top

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
do though what I would call the top

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.209 
do though what I would call the top
leaves<00:06:41.949> the<00:06:42.369> darker<00:06:42.939> leaves<00:06:43.559> not<00:06:44.559> the<00:06:44.769> shadows

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:45.219 
leaves the darker leaves not the shadows

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.129 
leaves the darker leaves not the shadows
and<00:06:45.699> leave<00:06:46.059> the<00:06:46.329> shadow<00:06:46.539> till<00:06:46.809> it's<00:06:46.929> shaded

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
and leave the shadow till it's shaded

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.399 
and leave the shadow till it's shaded
leaves<00:06:47.499> underneath<00:06:48.459> because<00:06:49.119> we're<00:06:50.109> trying

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
leaves underneath because we're trying

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.539 
leaves underneath because we're trying
to<00:06:50.529> imply<00:06:50.769> that<00:06:50.799> they're<00:06:51.159> in<00:06:51.279> the<00:06:51.399> background

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:51.549 
to imply that they're in the background

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:53.549 
to imply that they're in the background
so<00:06:52.209> by<00:06:52.449> being<00:06:52.689> in<00:06:52.839> the<00:06:52.899> background<00:06:53.319> you

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:53.559 
so by being in the background you

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:58.049 
so by being in the background you
wouldn't<00:06:53.889> see<00:06:54.899> the<00:06:55.899> detail<00:06:56.579> that<00:06:57.579> was<00:06:57.729> going

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:58.059 
wouldn't see the detail that was going

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:05.400 
wouldn't see the detail that was going
on<00:06:59.009> you<00:07:00.009> see

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.170 

and<00:07:05.890> this<00:07:06.040> is<00:07:06.130> a<00:07:06.160> great<00:07:06.460> thing<00:07:06.700> to<00:07:06.730> do<00:07:07.000> with

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
and this is a great thing to do with

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.500 
and this is a great thing to do with
silence<00:07:07.600> now<00:07:09.750> so<00:07:10.750> I've<00:07:11.020> just<00:07:11.050> got<00:07:11.410> one<00:07:11.470> more
