 was made of fireclay bricks 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.649
 especially for domestic stoves in this 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.469
 brick brands are the best indicator 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.050
 heat transfer the outer part did 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 method on the front side of the stake that

 warming up the bell and channel that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.750
 provides fast and full warm-up 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.030
 the entire furnace, a 60 liter tank 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.900
 made of stainless steel and

 used in stainless mild steel 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.570
 very durable and practical and pipes for 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.869
 data works, the water is heated from the closed 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.140
 the contour of the pipes and the tank itself is heated 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.720
 from the heat of exhaust gases water is heated for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 one and a half hours from a not boil in a tank 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.450
