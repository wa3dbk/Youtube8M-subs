00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 the bmw series 1 has been the first 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.100
 high-end compact to be renovated and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.189
 as you see the radical change has been his 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.710
 body grows 8 centimeters and its 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 battle has also been increased about 30 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 millimeters the new chassis also 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.559
 offers a greater width of ways 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 on the front axle as on the rear 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 about 50 mm approximately 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.500
 let's see what happens on the road 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 new series 1 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.000
 for this premiere we opted for the 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.980
 turbo-diesel version 120 of which in its 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 last delivery raises its power up 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.769
 the 184 horses and although optionally 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.229
 can equip an automatic change of 8 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.690
 marches our unit is satisfied with 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.030
 the six manual a bright set 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.610
 because it allows to accelerate with decision 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.420
 from down below and settle for a 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.020
 average of 5.5 liters in actual use its 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.789
 approved consumption is 4.5 and avoids 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.909
 tax of a degree because its 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.210
 emissions are limited to 119 grams per 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.210
 kilo 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.229
 Well the truth is that during this new 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.600
 series one does not need to link 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.190
 too many consecutive curves for 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.650
 realize that his philosophy has 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.900
 completely changed now it turns out 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.670
 much more comfortable suspensions and this 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.580
 frame warns us that its limits 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.560
 they are pretty close if we are too 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.750
 incisors or too determined in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.759
 driving soon we will hear a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 squeak of wheels or rolling 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.220
 body that will warn us that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.050
 let's lower the rhythm a little bit even though 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.209
 you have to fool yourself it's still a car 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.489
 of the most stable of its category that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.280
 It offers a very precise touch of direction 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.030
 and a change of short paths and touch 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.130
 very hard what allows a driving 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 certainly agile there is also a profit 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
 important in terms of interior space 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.959
 and in terms of visibility very 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.959
 correct 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.430
 but it is true that behind the wheel 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.680
 we march much more comfortable than in the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 series 1 previous to say of the part 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.450
 rear where we find a cabin 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.100
 completely different its occupants not 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
 they only have ventilation and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.660
 own lighting but that space 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.640
 available is more than enough 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.860
 by the height for the head as for 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.750
 Distance to knees or width 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.730
 at the height of the shoulders that also 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.580
 is more than adequate and all of it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 reserving a space of 360 liters 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.410
 for the trunk what has not changed 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.690
 in this second generation is that the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.210
 Most of the equipment is optional and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.670
 It has a significant cost equipment 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.490
 multimedia with parking system and 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.370
 professional radio included exceed 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.740
 1,200 euros and the standard tires are 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.460
 of 16 inches to get us with these 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.460
 of 18 we have to collect 2400 euros 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.050
 well that's the way the new bmw is serious 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.870
 more spacious and comfortable car than your 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.210
 ancestor that has lost some grip in 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.100
 the road will be appreciated by those who 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.410
 get used to making a greater number 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.020
 of kilometers on the highway and also 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.630
 tend to give more practical use in the 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.090
 day after day however they will have to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.190
 face the 30 thousand three hundred euros of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.580
 its price more than with equipment 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:12.090
 more or less adequate round the 35,000 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.090
 See you at the next big video 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.920
