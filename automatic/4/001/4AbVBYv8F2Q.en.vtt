00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.760
 hey welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.309
 Today with a compact in 5.1 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.690
 home theater system for the living room the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.770
 loudspeaker devil come out because he 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.690
 is synonymous without an av-receiver 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.240
 it could still be operated 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.010
 a deco or station included with 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.500
 the whole can be operated and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.840
 That's why even back even offers 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.960
 an amplifier here we see again 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.039
 the 330mm woofers left the two 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.350
 balancing opening otherwise on 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.479
 output power 40 watts the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 The subwoofer outputs and satellite 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:50.289
 150 watts to the subwoofer and one 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.479
 Frequency range from 33 to 250 heart rate 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.379
 covered 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.319
 Here we see one of them 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.889
 really nice aluminum satellites 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.679
 made very light but on 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.879
 still heavier than many others 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.460
 but plastic thing is also due to this 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.450
 just a lot of high quality and see here 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
 we also directly integrated 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020
 wall bracket and hold the two 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.640
 screw terminals with those on the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.660
 speaker cable is moored 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.730
 the satellites think 222,000 heart 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.910
 have 21 mm tweeter and a 280 mm 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.740
 midrange this is right and really 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.610
 very chic throughout the next already 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.670
 you have to look at the back of the subwoofer 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.190
 there you see the top already 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.440
 Entrances enter the initiative 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.650
 that's why it's not 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.260
 av receiver needed there are the whole 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.230
 line-in connections then we have stop 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.500
 in the middle the connections for the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.000
 individual satellites and below you can see 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.400
 still the electricity connection 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.159
 here where I just filmed then is 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200
 the volume connection so only because 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.070
 the subwoofer then regulates we still have 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.860
 a button and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.990
 Button with the one on the car and on 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.510
 It's almost possible to control the subwoofer 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.540
 turn on all in all 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 devil really has a very cool here 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.870
 home theater system delivered very compact 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.400
 the whole thing especially through the subwoofer 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.790
 which one also put on the side 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.380
 can 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 so it fits in smaller ones too 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.459
 living room and convinced anyway 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 you know that from devil by one 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.810
 excellent sound i hope you have
