but<00:00:39.140> there<00:00:39.320> are<00:00:39.470> some<00:00:39.739> similarities<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:40.879> will

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
but there are some similarities I will

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.009 
but there are some similarities I will
say<00:00:41.930> I've<00:00:42.379> tried<00:00:42.559> new<00:00:43.010> foods<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.019> that's

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
say I've tried new foods and that's

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.360 
say I've tried new foods and that's
something<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:45.559> thought<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:45.949> would<00:00:46.160> never

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
something that I thought I would never

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.520 
and believe in each other the team can
go<00:01:58.069> really<00:01:58.369> far<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.569> hopefully<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.229> can<00:02:00.350> make
