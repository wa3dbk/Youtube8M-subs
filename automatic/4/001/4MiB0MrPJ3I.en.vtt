Scott tell us what the miracle method is
and<00:00:17.190> what's<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.609> doing<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.260> we're

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and what's going to be doing here we're

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
and what's going to be doing here we're
doing<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> color<00:00:19.859> change<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.430> she<00:00:20.699> wants

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
doing a color change on this she wants

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
doing a color change on this she wants
to<00:00:21.000> update<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> kohler<00:00:22.560> biscuit<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> more

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
to update to a kohler biscuit a more

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.740 
to update to a kohler biscuit a more
modern<00:00:23.970> color<00:00:24.890> we're<00:00:25.890> doing<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.750> acrylic

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
modern color we're doing the acrylic

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.550 
modern color we're doing the acrylic
whirlpool<00:00:28.289> tub<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> tile<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:31.320> first

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
whirlpool tub and the tile and the first

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.650 
whirlpool tub and the tile and the first
step<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> basically<00:00:32.369> clean<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> surface

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
step is to basically clean the surface

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.760 
step is to basically clean the surface
dry<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.360> surrounding<00:00:36.360> areas<00:00:36.690> masked<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.260> then

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
dry it surrounding areas masked off then

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
dry it surrounding areas masked off then
we<00:00:37.860> put<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> proprietary<00:00:39.000> chemical<00:00:39.540> bonding

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we put on a proprietary chemical bonding

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
we put on a proprietary chemical bonding
agent<00:00:40.170> called<00:00:40.379> mm<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.070> numerical<00:00:41.969> methods

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
agent called mm for numerical methods

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360 
agent called mm for numerical methods
the<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> bonding<00:00:43.890> agent<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the only one with that bonding agent and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
the only one with that bonding agent and
that<00:00:44.399> grabs<00:00:44.969> tightly<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> original

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that grabs tightly to the original

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
that grabs tightly to the original
surface<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.770> spray<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.250> three<00:00:47.489> coats<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
surface then we spray on three coats of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
surface then we spray on three coats of
a<00:00:48.000> durable<00:00:48.360> acrylic<00:00:48.629> urethane<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a durable acrylic urethane the two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
a durable acrylic urethane the two
materials<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.360> themselves

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
materials kind of well themselves

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
materials kind of well themselves
together<00:00:52.020> giving<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> tight<00:00:53.160> molecular

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
together giving you a tight molecular

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
together giving you a tight molecular
type<00:00:54.180> bond<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.170> any<00:00:55.289> problems

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
type bond so we don't have any problems

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.830 
type bond so we don't have any problems
with<00:00:55.710> peeling<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.489> flaking<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.510> chipping

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
with peeling or flaking or or chipping

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.189 
with peeling or flaking or or chipping
off<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> best<00:01:00.239> bonding<00:01:00.629> system<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
off so it's the best bonding system and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.630 
off so it's the best bonding system and
the<00:01:01.440> coating<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> finest

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the coating we use is the finest

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
the coating we use is the finest
available<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> durable<00:01:04.080> acrylic

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
available it's a durable acrylic
