of Kerala so let's have a quick view on
the<00:00:28.260> ingredients<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.890> make<00:00:28.920> area<00:00:29.400> pump<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the ingredients to make area pump I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450 
the ingredients to make area pump I
would<00:00:30.000> require<00:00:30.269> rice<00:00:31.199> flour<00:00:31.560> ghee<00:00:32.250> or

clarified butter salt so let's quickly
start<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> very<00:00:36.270> simple<00:00:36.660> recipe<00:00:36.890> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
start it is a very simple recipe to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
start it is a very simple recipe to
begin<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> heat<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> pan<00:00:39.690> in

begin with I'm going to heat up a pan in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:55.260 
begin with I'm going to heat up a pan in
which<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> am<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> boil<00:00:42.030> 2<00:00:42.300> cups<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.690> water

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.690 

the<00:00:56.270> ratio<00:00:56.600> for<00:00:56.809> making<00:00:57.140> area<00:00:57.410> pump<00:00:57.649> is<00:00:57.800> 1<00:00:58.280> SC<00:00:58.460> 2

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
the ratio for making area pump is 1 SC 2

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.200 
the ratio for making area pump is 1 SC 2
that<00:00:59.390> means<00:00:59.600> one<00:01:00.170> part<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.920> rice<00:01:01.340> lakh<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:02.059> 2

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that means one part of rice lakh to 2

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.530 
that means one part of rice lakh to 2
parts<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.629> water<00:01:03.909> now<00:01:04.909> do<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.180> water<00:01:05.360> I'm

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
parts of water now do the water I'm

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.600 
parts of water now do the water I'm
going<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.810> add<00:01:05.930> some<00:01:06.409> salt<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.740> around<00:01:10.460> a

table spoon of ghee I'm going to wait
till<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.450> comes<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.840> boil

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.600 

usually<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.440> served<00:01:18.800> on<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.190> streets<00:01:19.460> of

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
also stuffed with keema

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.960 
also stuffed with keema
so<00:01:24.500> now<00:01:24.650> as<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:24.950> can<00:01:25.100> see<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> water<00:01:25.700> has<00:01:25.909> come

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
so now as you can see the water has come

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.749 
so now as you can see the water has come
to<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.300> boil<00:01:26.710> quickly<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.770> am<00:01:27.800> going<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.070> add<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
to a boil quickly I am going to add the

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.749 
to a boil quickly I am going to add the
rice<00:01:29.000> flour<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:29.750> 1<00:01:30.110> cup<00:01:33.610> mix<00:01:34.610> this

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
rice flour which is 1 cup mix this

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.430 
rice flour which is 1 cup mix this
nicely<00:01:39.490> keep<00:01:40.490> stirring<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.300> now<00:01:42.200> as<00:01:42.350> you

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
nicely keep stirring it and now as you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.100 
nicely keep stirring it and now as you
can<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:43.700> flour<00:01:43.940> has<00:01:44.210> absorbed<00:01:44.750> all<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
can see the flour has absorbed all the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.749 
can see the flour has absorbed all the
water<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.520> forming<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.119> dough<00:01:48.759> make

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
water and it is forming a dough make

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.270 
water and it is forming a dough make
sure<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.179> there<00:01:50.420> are<00:01:50.539> no<00:01:50.780> lumps<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.320> the

sure that there are no lumps in the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.100 
sure that there are no lumps in the
mixture<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.360> now<00:01:56.479> as<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.690> can<00:01:56.840> see<00:01:56.960> the

mixture so now as you can see the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.040 
mixture so now as you can see the
mixture<00:01:57.350> form<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> dough<00:01:58.369> at<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:59.630> stage<00:01:59.869> I

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
mixture form to a dough at this stage I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.080 
mixture form to a dough at this stage I
am<00:02:00.110> going<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.349> shut<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.649> gas<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.099> wait<00:02:01.789> we'll

so on the base I am going to put the
very<00:02:13.520> fine<00:02:13.940> hole<00:02:14.440> perforated<00:02:15.440> disc<00:02:15.680> which<00:02:16.610> is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
very fine hole perforated disc which is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.290 
very fine hole perforated disc which is
used<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.209> making<00:02:17.680> idiot<00:02:18.680> um<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.160> also<00:02:19.970> for

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
used for making idiot um and also for

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.550 
used for making idiot um and also for
that<00:02:20.530> thin<00:02:21.530> save<00:02:22.030> take<00:02:23.030> some<00:02:23.300> portion<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.750> this
