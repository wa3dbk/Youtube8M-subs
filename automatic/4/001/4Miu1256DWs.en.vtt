noticed that the logo went away that was

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.490 
noticed that the logo went away that was
one<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.180> biggest<00:02:37.450> pet<00:02:37.750> peeves<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.350> old

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
one of my biggest pet peeves in the old

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
one of my biggest pet peeves in the old
one<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.190> logo<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.640> always<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.300> there

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
one is that that logo is always up there

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.870 
one is that that logo is always up there
and<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.650> always<00:02:41.860> saw<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.430> everything

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
and so you always saw it and everything

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.970 
and so you always saw it and everything

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
but now I have it so it's more

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.850

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
won't let me do like a layout for an

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.670 
won't let me do like a layout for an
actual<00:04:04.450> keyboard<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.230> had<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.440> kind<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:07.680> set

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
actual keyboard so I had to kind of set

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.230 
actual keyboard so I had to kind of set
it<00:04:08.770> up<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.190> looks<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.520> a<00:04:09.640> keyboard<00:04:10.180> but

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
it up so it looks like a keyboard but

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.450 
it up so it looks like a keyboard but
it's<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.810> exactly<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.500> keyboard<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:14.460> right

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
it's not exactly a keyboard and right

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.940 
it's not exactly a keyboard and right
now<00:04:15.640> there's<00:04:16.239> some<00:04:16.540> limitations<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.799> know

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
now there's some limitations you know

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.610 
now there's some limitations you know
for<00:04:18.370> right<00:04:18.520> now<00:04:18.549> with<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.440> hopefully<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.590> the

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
for right now with it hopefully in the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.510 
for right now with it hopefully in the
and<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:23.290> future<00:04:23.710> could<00:04:23.860> see<00:04:24.040> how<00:04:24.160> right<00:04:24.370> now

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
and the future could see how right now

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.140 
and the future could see how right now
everything<00:04:25.120> went<00:04:25.740> out<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:26.980> side<00:04:27.190> when<00:04:27.970> I'm

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
everything went out to the side when I'm

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.480 
everything went out to the side when I'm
finished<00:04:28.360> with<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.050> should<00:04:29.410> have<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.130> small

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
finished with it it should have a small

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.790 
finished with it it should have a small
area<00:04:30.730> right<00:04:31.060> underneath<00:04:31.390> here<00:04:32.020> where<00:04:32.680> it

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
area right underneath here where it

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.080 
area right underneath here where it
actually<00:04:33.010> has<00:04:36.510> your<00:04:37.510> search<00:04:37.720> info<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.850> now

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
actually has your search info right now

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.180 
actually has your search info right now
I<00:04:40.450> mean<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:40.990> still<00:04:41.050> buggy<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.830> I'm<00:04:41.950> still

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
I mean it's still buggy and I'm still

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.220 
I mean it's still buggy and I'm still
working<00:04:42.550> with<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.940> but<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.660> making<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> lot<00:04:44.200> of

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
working with it but I'm making a lot of

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:51.010 
working with it but I'm making a lot of
progress

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.640 

and<00:04:52.120> I'll<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:53.270> back<00:04:53.629> out<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.080> kind<00:04:54.259> of<00:04:54.349> scan

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
and I'll just back out and kind of scan

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.730 
and I'll just back out and kind of scan
through<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.009> again<00:04:55.099> see<00:04:56.060> y'all<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.449> see<00:04:59.740> so

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
through it again see y'all can see so

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.969 
through it again see y'all can see so
there's<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.599> one<00:05:02.599> for<00:05:02.930> video<00:05:03.729> for<00:05:04.729> audio

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
there's the one for video for audio

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.999 
there's the one for video for audio
images<00:05:08.199> connected<00:05:09.199> is<00:05:09.289> basically<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
images connected is basically the

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:18.219 
images connected is basically the
internet<00:05:11.319> TV<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.599> DVD<00:05:16.090> search<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:18.169> I

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
internet TV and the DVD search and I

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.360 
internet TV and the DVD search and I
don't<00:05:18.440> have<00:05:19.090> 144<00:05:20.090> exit<00:05:20.539> or<00:05:20.860> play<00:05:21.860> less<00:05:22.099> of<00:05:22.250> them

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
don't have 144 exit or play less of them

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.839 
don't have 144 exit or play less of them
think<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.669> needed<00:05:22.970> one

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.559 

but<00:05:29.509> I<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.619> how<00:05:30.770> it<00:05:30.889> turned<00:05:30.919> out<00:05:31.569> everything

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
but I like how it turned out everything

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:40.180 
but I like how it turned out everything
seems<00:05:32.899> to<00:05:33.110> be<00:05:33.229> running<00:05:33.679> real<00:05:34.009> smooth

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.920 

and<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:41.150> mean<00:05:41.300> once<00:05:41.480> you<00:05:41.570> get<00:05:41.720> everything

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
and I mean once you get everything

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.160 
and I mean once you get everything
organized<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.770> grew<00:05:43.040> I<00:05:43.220> basically<00:05:43.960> write<00:05:44.960> my

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
organized I grew I basically write my

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.730 
organized I grew I basically write my
own<00:05:46.510> tags<00:05:47.510> for<00:05:48.310> like<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.430> interface<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.960> for<00:05:51.410> I

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
own tags for like the interface so for I

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800 
own tags for like the interface so for I
use<00:05:52.220> basically<00:05:52.700> what<00:05:52.910> they<00:05:53.030> call<00:05:53.210> grouping

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
use basically what they call grouping

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.260 
use basically what they call grouping
