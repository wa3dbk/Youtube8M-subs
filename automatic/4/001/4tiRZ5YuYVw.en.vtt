00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 so welcome to a tutorial from me 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.000
 I am the freak laid and I show 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.030
 Join me today with me 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 brother how to minecraft in pocket 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 edition multiplayer is playing now 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.840
 really often requested this tutorial 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 and today the time has come 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 generally times multiplayer gameplay 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.680
 is still in the political moment 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 very limited but works between 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.710
 So apple and android perfectly 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.899
 there are no problems or anything 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.510
 in the next minecraft version 0 7 0 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.059
 the april will come out there in the neighborhood 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 then online multiplayer and there will be 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 then many other features 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.989
 come to that and the whole will be a lot 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 become more professional so you have to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.100
 First of all make sure that all 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 players who play in your server 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.039
 want to be in the same wlan otherwise 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.199
 it works at the moment 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.800
 Not 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.629
 Alternatively if you are now for example 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the train or so can the one 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.900
 open hotspot i showed you set 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.070
 just on my galaxy s2 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 how is it now with every mobile phone 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 Otherwise, however, here could be one 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 Mobile Wi-Fi hotspot on 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.070
 you just have to take care that it is that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 not the internet connection 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.490
 Shares it shows you no money 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.990
 then takes up going to the internet 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.729
 if you have the hotspot on you can 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 also train together, I'm playing 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.009
 the now but back out because I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.670
 with my brother just over the wifi 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.240
 will do 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 we are connected again 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.220
 then I'll put a server on me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.649
 go into the minecraft pocket edition 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:02.610
 so now i can get here i have here 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.570
 made a multiplayer map and this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.910
 I can adjust now by clicking here 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.200
 on 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 or at Apple is up here 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.050
 right such a small break button and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 then I put the server on wissel bo 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.430
 Now there is the possibility that one 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.590
 other players join in the case 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.630
 my brother and here will be the same 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 message appears that he joined 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.489
 is and we will see the same here 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.370
 just as proof that it works 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.760
 when my brother plays on apple and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 i want on android because of that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.269
 it still works without having here 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.090
 we see him and we'll see right away 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.950
 my skin why that is so is just 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.569
 also limited feature yes you can 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.480
 have no own skills in 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.010
 multiplayer currently but everyone has 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.220
 then the skin yes everyone has the service 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.849
 a servus chin so to speak but me 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.290
 now with the the app pocket for 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.319
 example, the skin cleanse then see 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 both of us both in this skin 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.650
 a brother has no one could see there 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.579
 Both of us still in the funds can do so 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.290
 Besides, there is no chat to be helpful 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.930
 Can you describe yourself with me? 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.470
 1 in my hand and then I write 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.810
 Just let me know and he will write 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.799
 he does not write anything back 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.060
 back ok bio hey writes back where yes 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.100
 so you can shop a bit 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 Of course, it also works in survival mode 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.840
 lemm shield repeatedly and can 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.200
 instrument again get what it 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.880
 does not mean ex over the heads 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.209
 they will be in the next update too 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.319
 I'll show you that now 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:03.269
 how to join a server so now 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.090
 I can show you that as well 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.859
 you how to join a server and 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.980
 my brother will at the same time be the 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:15.120
 hire server and we will see it 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.579
 here so 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.740
 pixel p the number here 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.340
 This looks like the airport we can 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.860
 just enter in the main menu 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:36.169
 go first to join to server and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.169
 then we are together in the world 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.720
 both is her neighborhood 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.229
 So yes, you can see if it works 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.580
 both in the same wlan are what I am 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.220
 I can do it now as well 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.560
 leave now the map and thereby the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.110
 map map that means I have the map 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:08.100
 then in the single player I call now 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:09.960
 times copied world like that and now I have 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.260
 here in the single player this 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.190
 world and I can continue to work 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.330
 and then do it again, so to speak 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.700
 but this feature is still very much 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.479
 partly missing then partly pieces 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.720
 from the mep yes it is not yet 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:32.310
 very mature and if I am now 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.370
 go back to the map and the map 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.440
 is in survival mode then mine is 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.110
 whole inventory away and I am too 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.110
 again at the main tunnel that means mine 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.970
 my presence was not saved 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.560
 I am not where I am 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.639
 went out and have mine too 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.440
 inventory no longer 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.840
 that's why it's important that you do that 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.120
 inventory so the player's accession 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.900
 that he left his inventory before that 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.550
 just do it quickly in boxes and then 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.930
 it is totally deducted and 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.669
 the next entry can if then 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.419
 back to the box and yourself 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:11.590
 to repeat his inventory 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:14.210
 yes that was I hope 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.140
 we were able to help you out exactly 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.140
 Yes exactly 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.100
 yes if you liked the video and 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.170
 you can do that much better now 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.890
 with the multiplayer load easier 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.970
 have a look in mainz am Rhein 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.760
 There are, among other things, let's play 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.590
