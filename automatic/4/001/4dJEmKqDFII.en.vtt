00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
it's called a PKU test and they put a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.040 
it's called a PKU test and they put a
lance<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> foot<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.570> heel<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:01.930> foot

Laurel at blood screaming it sucks that
she<00:02:08.440> has<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.679> go<00:02:08.830> through<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.190> again<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.790> then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
she has to go through it again and then

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600 
she has to go through it again and then
Krista<00:02:10.810> also<00:02:11.260> has<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> blood<00:02:12.130> test<00:02:12.340> done

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
Krista also has to get a blood test done

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.730 
Krista also has to get a blood test done
for<00:02:12.880> her<00:02:13.000> vitamin<00:02:13.450> D<00:02:13.630> levels<00:02:13.990> for<00:02:14.230> her<00:02:14.350> vertigo

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
for her vitamin D levels for her vertigo

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.130 
for her vitamin D levels for her vertigo
we<00:02:15.670> did<00:02:15.820> some<00:02:15.970> more<00:02:16.000> research<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.750> vertigo

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
we did some more research on the vertigo

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.260 
we did some more research on the vertigo
and<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.560> thinking<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.640> magnesium

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
and I'm thinking it's a magnesium

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.930 
and I'm thinking it's a magnesium
deficiency<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.200> she's<00:02:20.440> having<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.280> we're

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
deficiency that she's having so we're

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.930 
deficiency that she's having so we're
gonna<00:02:22.440> take<00:02:23.440> some<00:02:23.500> more<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.010> see<00:02:24.430> how<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.670> did

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
gonna take some more that see how we did

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.410 
gonna take some more that see how we did
going<00:02:25.360> into<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> hospital<00:02:25.780> here

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
simple it was for the lady to do it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.820 
simple it was for the lady to do it
today<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:55.810> opposed<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> last<00:02:56.440> time<00:02:56.650> where

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
today as opposed the last time where

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.710 
today as opposed the last time where
they<00:02:56.920> took<00:02:57.100> forever<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:57.970> took<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.510> much

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
they took forever and they took so much

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.910 
they took forever and they took so much
blood<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:07.050> got<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.110> bunch<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.410> junk
