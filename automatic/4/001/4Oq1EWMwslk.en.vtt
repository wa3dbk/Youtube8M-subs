00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
face is not one of yeah I totally will

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
face is not one of yeah I totally will
do<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:32.969> fighting<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.450> possible<00:00:33.899> in

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
do as little fighting as possible in

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.610 
do as little fighting as possible in
fact<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:35.130> God<00:00:35.489> Serena<00:00:35.880> isn't<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.630> there<00:00:36.840> on

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
fact if God Serena isn't over there on

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
fact if God Serena isn't over there on
an<00:00:37.800> undercover<00:00:38.070> mission<00:00:38.340> by<00:00:38.790> himself<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.780> think

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
an undercover mission by himself I think

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
an undercover mission by himself I think
that<00:00:40.649> God<00:00:40.770> Serena<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.550> perfect<00:00:42.149> target<00:00:42.329> for

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that God Serena is a perfect target for

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
that God Serena is a perfect target for
Natsu<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.800> probably<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.280> level

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
Natsu I think that's probably the level

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
Natsu I think that's probably the level
not<00:00:44.670> suits<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> point<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
not suits on at this point that's one of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
not suits on at this point that's one of
the<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> frustrates<00:00:47.640> me

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the things that really frustrates me

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
the things that really frustrates me
about<00:00:48.360> fairy<00:00:48.989> tale<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> fact<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> really

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
about fairy tale is the fact that really

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
about fairy tale is the fact that really
the<00:00:50.700> only<00:00:50.820> ones<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> ever<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.840> any<00:00:52.079> actual

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the only ones that ever see any actual

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.939 
the only ones that ever see any actual
growth<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.460> main<00:00:53.670> cast<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:55.140> rather<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
growth is the main cast or rather the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
growth is the main cast or rather the
characters<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> fairy<00:00:57.840> tale

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
characters that are just in fairy tale

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
characters that are just in fairy tale
it's<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.530> somehow<00:00:58.800> everyone<00:00:59.460> else<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's like somehow everyone else just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.020 
it's like somehow everyone else just
remains<00:01:00.239> stagnant<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
remains stagnant over time and like the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.429 
remains stagnant over time and like the
only<00:01:03.180> ones<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.570> ever<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> train<00:01:04.260> our

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
only ones that ever think to train our

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
only ones that ever think to train our
the<00:01:04.530> fairy<00:01:04.710> tale<00:01:04.920> members<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:06.299> not

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the fairy tale members but that's not

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
the fairy tale members but that's not

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
way um I really really like the plan and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.039 
way um I really really like the plan and
it<00:01:11.970> makes<00:01:12.119> perfect<00:01:12.270> sense<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.659> could<00:01:12.869> yield

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
year ago and we know that he's gotten so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.780 
year ago and we know that he's gotten so
much<00:03:39.030> stronger<00:03:39.590> natsu<00:03:40.590> he<00:03:41.160> probably<00:03:41.430> could<00:03:41.670> be

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
much stronger natsu he probably could be

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.920 
much stronger natsu he probably could be
somewhere<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.239> those<00:03:42.360> ten<00:03:42.630> wizard<00:03:42.780> Saints

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
somewhere in those ten wizard Saints

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.009 
somewhere in those ten wizard Saints
like<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:45.150> think<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:45.690> we're<00:03:45.780> going<00:03:45.930> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
like I don't think that we're going to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.360 
like I don't think that we're going to
involve<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.709> rest<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> ten<00:03:47.250> wizard

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
involve the rest of the ten wizard

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.800 
involve the rest of the ten wizard
Saints<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.030> what's<00:03:48.180> about<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.420> happen<00:03:48.600> I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
Saints and what's about to happen I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.580 
Saints and what's about to happen I
think<00:03:48.840> it's<00:03:49.079> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> stay<00:03:49.380> strictly

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
think it's going to stay strictly

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.620 
think it's going to stay strictly
fairytale<00:03:50.190> especially<00:03:50.670> because<00:03:50.970> now<00:03:51.600> that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
fairytale especially because now that

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.449 
fairytale especially because now that
we've<00:03:51.930> lost<00:03:52.170> our<00:03:52.410> main<00:03:52.680> defense<00:03:53.190> our

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
we've lost our main defense our

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.819 
we've lost our main defense our
strongest<00:03:53.850> wizard<00:03:54.329> in<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.510> country<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
strongest wizard in the country the

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.560 
strongest wizard in the country the
others<00:03:56.160> are<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.790> stay<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.209> so

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
others are going to have to stay back so

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.780 
others are going to have to stay back so
that<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.110> get<00:03:58.350> attacked<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.519> someone

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that if we get attacked we have someone

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.840 
that if we get attacked we have someone
to<00:04:00.030> defend<00:04:00.150> ourselves<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.430> think<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:02.790> is

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
to defend ourselves so I think this is

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.660 
to defend ourselves so I think this is
going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> stay<00:04:03.420> strictly<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.900> fairy<00:04:04.230> tale

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
going to stay strictly a fairy tale

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.330 
going to stay strictly a fairy tale
infiltration<00:04:05.670> as<00:04:06.000> far<00:04:06.209> as<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.480> goes<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:07.340> if

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
infiltration as far as that goes but if

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.060 
infiltration as far as that goes but if
Serena<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.959> been<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> really<00:04:10.440> recent<00:04:10.709> thing

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
Serena it's been a really recent thing

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.979 
Serena it's been a really recent thing
because<00:04:11.400> juror<00:04:11.640> even<00:04:11.940> ask<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.269> said<00:04:12.510> okay

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
because juror even ask it said okay

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.720 
because juror even ask it said okay
here's<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.350> three<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.799> now<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.549> where

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
here's the three of you now know where

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.680 
here's the three of you now know where
its<00:04:14.850> Serena<00:04:15.180> go<00:04:15.829> so<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:16.859> don't<00:04:17.370> know<00:04:17.519> how<00:04:18.180> recent

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
its Serena go so I don't know how recent

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.150 
its Serena go so I don't know how recent
this<00:04:18.780> was<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.169> had<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.739> pretty

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
this was but it had to be a pretty

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.070 
this was but it had to be a pretty
recent<00:04:20.669> decision<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.180> don't<00:04:21.390> know<00:04:21.479> what<00:04:21.840> would

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
recent decision I don't know what would

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.140 
recent decision I don't know what would
have<00:04:22.200> spurred<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.470> decision<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.220> or<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.030> is

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
have spurred that decision on or it is

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.640 
have spurred that decision on or it is
aware<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.599> situation<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:25.289> trying<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> go

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
aware of the situation of trying to go

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.150 
aware of the situation of trying to go
rescue<00:04:25.890> me

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
rescue me

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.670 
rescue me
makarov<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.820> we<00:04:27.750> think<00:04:27.960> he's<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> only<00:04:28.410> one

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
makarov and we think he's the only one

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.200 
makarov and we think he's the only one
that<00:04:28.710> was<00:04:28.950> aware<00:04:29.190> at<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.370> situation<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.970> don't

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
that was aware at the situation I don't

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.900 
that was aware at the situation I don't
think<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.160> Serena<00:04:32.160> would<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:32.460> any<00:04:32.610> ties<00:04:32.880> to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
think that Serena would have any ties to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.970 
think that Serena would have any ties to
Makarov<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.050> had<00:04:34.260> anything<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:34.950> with

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
Makarov if that had anything to do with

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.740 
Makarov if that had anything to do with
it<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.880> did<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> don't<00:04:36.540> know<00:04:36.660> if

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
it and if that did and I don't know if

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.550 
it and if that did and I don't know if
she's<00:04:36.900> keep<00:04:37.410> sorry<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:39.270> figured<00:04:40.110> I'd<00:04:40.230> say<00:04:40.380> she

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
she's keep sorry I figured I'd say she

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.060 
she's keep sorry I figured I'd say she
at<00:04:40.680> some<00:04:40.860> point<00:04:41.100> because<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.550> name<00:04:41.700> um<00:04:43.070> I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
at some point because of the name um I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.150 
at some point because of the name um I
had<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.790> my<00:04:44.970> head<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:45.990> don't<00:04:46.770> think<00:04:47.070> that

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
had it in my head but I don't think that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.190 
had it in my head but I don't think that
he<00:04:47.490> went<00:04:47.610> over<00:04:47.820> there<00:04:47.970> for<00:04:48.000> Mac<00:04:48.330> Rob's<00:04:48.660> sake<00:04:48.900> so

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
he went over there for Mac Rob's sake so

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.620 
he went over there for Mac Rob's sake so
I<00:04:49.470> guess<00:04:49.590> he<00:04:49.950> he's<00:04:50.550> either<00:04:50.790> over<00:04:51.270> there<00:04:51.450> for

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
I guess he he's either over there for

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.190 
I guess he he's either over there for
infiltration<00:04:52.160> by<00:04:53.160> his<00:04:53.370> own<00:04:53.520> design<00:04:53.850> or<00:04:54.200> he

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
infiltration by his own design or he

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680 
infiltration by his own design or he
really<00:04:55.380> has<00:04:55.620> decided<00:04:56.100> well<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:57.120> country<00:04:57.510> has

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
really has decided well this country has

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.380 
really has decided well this country has
no<00:04:58.380> hope<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:59.190> I'm<00:04:59.520> gonna<00:04:59.850> go<00:05:00.060> over<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.300> the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
no hope so I'm gonna go over to the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.450 
no hope so I'm gonna go over to the
winning<00:05:00.630> side<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:01.110> which<00:05:01.320> case<00:05:01.590> he<00:05:02.130> needs<00:05:02.340> to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
winning side in which case he needs to

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.300 
winning side in which case he needs to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
be put down big time because you can't

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.150

that we're involving any of the council
other<00:05:20.490> than<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.670> fact<00:05:20.790> that<00:05:20.970> now<00:05:21.210> we're<00:05:21.390> going
