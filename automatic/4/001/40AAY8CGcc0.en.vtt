hello I'm bill donelly from sapphire
technology<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.670> today<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> talk

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
technology and today I want to talk

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740 
technology and today I want to talk
about<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.530> new<00:00:13.799> display<00:00:14.250> technology<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
about a new display technology from the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.640 
about a new display technology from the
ATI<00:00:16.049> division<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.650> AMD<00:00:17.100> called<00:00:17.490> eyefinity

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
ATI division of AMD called eyefinity

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
ATI division of AMD called eyefinity
eyefinity<00:00:19.650> basically<00:00:20.100> allows<00:00:20.369> us<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.820> run

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
eyefinity basically allows us to run

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.599 
eyefinity basically allows us to run
three<00:00:21.720> computer<00:00:22.470> screens<00:00:22.769> simultaneously

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
three computer screens simultaneously

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.300 
three computer screens simultaneously
from<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.090> graphics<00:00:24.480> card<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
from one graphics card and to have it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700 
from one graphics card and to have it
treated<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.060> though<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.689> big<00:00:27.930> monitor<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
treated as though as one big monitor so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
treated as though as one big monitor so
whether<00:00:29.070> you're<00:00:29.220> running<00:00:29.340> games<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:30.029> other

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
whether you're running games or other

whether you're running games or other
applications<00:00:30.840> across<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.859> gives<00:00:32.130> you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
applications across there it gives you

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
applications across there it gives you
one<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:33.149> big<00:00:33.329> field<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.870> view<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.230> nice

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
one really big field of view with nice

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.979 
one really big field of view with nice
high<00:00:34.680> resolution<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> gamers<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
high resolution and for the gamers that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
high resolution and for the gamers that
makes<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.440> immersive<00:00:37.920> experience<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
makes it a very immersive experience for

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
makes it a very immersive experience for
using<00:00:39.899> other<00:00:40.020> applications<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.129> behaves<00:00:41.460> like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
using other applications it behaves like

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
using other applications it behaves like
you've<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.690> enormous<00:00:42.870> desktop

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you've got one really enormous desktop

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
you've got one really enormous desktop
so<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> could<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.760> example<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so that you could have for example a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
so that you could have for example a
photoshop<00:00:45.870> application<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.950> menu

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
photoshop application and all this menu

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.450 
photoshop application and all this menu
is<00:00:47.399> open<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:47.940> different<00:00:48.629> areas<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> screen

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
is open on different areas of the screen

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.170 
is open on different areas of the screen
but<00:00:50.460> there's<00:00:50.640> been<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
but there's been a little bit of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
but there's been a little bit of
confusion<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.469> exactly<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.190> its<00:00:53.340> set

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
confusion about how exactly how its set

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
confusion about how exactly how its set
up<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.230> what<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
up and what you have to do to make it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
up and what you have to do to make it
work<00:00:56.250> correctly<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.210> where<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> what

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
work correctly so where this is what

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
work correctly so where this is what
we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> run<00:00:58.350> through<00:00:58.379> today<00:00:58.879> we've

because<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.110> adapters<00:01:34.470> available<00:01:34.829> but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
because there are adapters available but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
because there are adapters available but
they<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.240> an<00:01:36.329> active<00:01:36.810> adapter<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they have to be an active adapter to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
they have to be an active adapter to
convert<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> signals<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:38.759> displayport<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
active displayport to vga adapters so if

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
active displayport to vga adapters so if
you<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> earlier<00:01:59.969> type<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.390> monitor

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you have the earlier type of monitor

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
you have the earlier type of monitor
then<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.860> type<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> adapter

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
then you could use this type of adapter

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.710 
then you could use this type of adapter
to<00:02:03.210> work<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.630> eyefinity

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to work with eyefinity

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.870 
to work with eyefinity
just<00:02:05.440> coming<00:02:05.620> onto<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.980> market<00:02:06.010> now<00:02:06.580> they're

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
just coming onto the market now they're

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.350 
just coming onto the market now they're
also<00:02:07.090> some<00:02:07.920> displayport<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.040> hdmi<00:02:09.360> adapters

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
also some displayport to hdmi adapters

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.840 
also some displayport to hdmi adapters
again<00:02:10.990> active<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.680> they<00:02:11.800> work<00:02:12.100> with<00:02:12.280> eyefinity

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
again active so they work with eyefinity

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.730 
again active so they work with eyefinity
which<00:02:13.330> could<00:02:13.570> mean<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.930> you'd<00:02:14.080> use<00:02:14.350> your<00:02:14.530> TV

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
which could mean that you'd use your TV

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.680 
which could mean that you'd use your TV
is<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.250> third<00:02:15.460> display<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.150> eyefinity<00:02:16.660> setup

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
is the third display and eyefinity setup

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.510 
is the third display and eyefinity setup
so<00:02:17.380> we've<00:02:17.470> installed<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> graphics<00:02:18.280> card

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
so we've installed the graphics card

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.460 
so we've installed the graphics card
into<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.850> system<00:02:19.300> we've<00:02:19.720> connected<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
into the system we've connected up the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.770 
into the system we've connected up the

button here to force detect displays now
we<00:02:44.740> can<00:02:44.950> see<00:02:45.130> at<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> bottom<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.940> area

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
we can see at the bottom of this area

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.210 
we can see at the bottom of this area
that<00:02:46.420> well<00:02:47.020> though<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.350> have<00:02:47.500> three<00:02:47.770> displays

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that well though we have three displays

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.490 
that well though we have three displays
connected<00:02:48.880> only<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.780> them<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:49.990> enabled

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
connected only one of them is enabled

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.020 
connected only one of them is enabled
which<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.830> why<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.160> only<00:02:51.190> have<00:02:51.490> one<00:02:51.670> display

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
which is why we only have one display

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.970 
which is why we only have one display
lit<00:02:52.240> up<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.570> moment<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.560> what<00:02:53.709> I'm<00:02:53.800> going

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
lit up at the moment so what I'm going

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.920 
lit up at the moment so what I'm going
to<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.730> first<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.240> all<00:02:55.330> I'm<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.780> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to do is first of all I'm going to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.010 
to do is first of all I'm going to
duplicate<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:57.190> primary<00:02:57.700> display<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
duplicate the primary display on to the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.820 
duplicate the primary display on to the
other<00:02:59.170> monitors<00:03:00.450> except<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> same

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
other monitors except that do the same

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.440 
other monitors except that do the same
with<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> other<00:03:03.070> monitor<00:03:03.610> duplicate<00:03:04.480> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
with the other monitor duplicate and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.810 
with the other monitor duplicate and
accept<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.890> now<00:03:09.160> we've<00:03:09.340> got<00:03:09.519> all<00:03:09.670> three

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
accept so now we've got all three

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.759 
accept so now we've got all three
monitors<00:03:10.150> enabled<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.050> it's<00:03:11.200> not<00:03:11.440> yet<00:03:11.620> an

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
affinity group to create a group I go

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.190 
affinity group to create a group I go

into this center panel again and there's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.680 
into this center panel again and there's
a<00:03:17.290> menu<00:03:17.560> option<00:03:17.800> here<00:03:18.220> called<00:03:18.390> display<00:03:19.390> group

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
a menu option here called display group

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.430 
a menu option here called display group
we<00:03:20.110> go<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> create<00:03:20.920> group<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
we go to create group and we have a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.380 
we go to create group and we have a
choice<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.920> end<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.430> configuration<00:03:25.360> of

choice to end of the configuration of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.940 
choice to end of the configuration of
our<00:03:25.540> group<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:25.989> we<00:03:26.019> could<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.470> them<00:03:26.590> stacked

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
our group so we could have them stacked

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.160 
our group so we could have them stacked
or<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.670> could<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:28.000> them<00:03:28.120> side<00:03:28.360> by<00:03:28.390> side<00:03:28.600> but

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
or we could have them side by side but

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.229 
or we could have them side by side but
because<00:03:29.470> i<00:03:29.500> have<00:03:29.709> three<00:03:30.040> monitors<00:03:30.340> here<00:03:30.730> side

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
because i have three monitors here side

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.120 
because i have three monitors here side
by<00:03:31.269> side<00:03:31.720> i'm<00:03:32.019> going<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.320> choose<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.769> three<00:03:32.890> by

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
by side i'm going to choose the three by

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.440 
by side i'm going to choose the three by
one<00:03:33.340> option<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.970> accepted<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.150> can<00:03:37.299> see

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
one option and accepted so we can see

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.390 
one option and accepted so we can see
that<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:37.720> created<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.350> an<00:03:38.470> affinity<00:03:38.980> group

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that it's created in an affinity group

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.490 
that it's created in an affinity group

it lights up and that will help it to
automatically<00:03:59.890> reorder<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.180> displays<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.780> be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
automatically reorder the displays to be

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.050 
automatically reorder the displays to be
correct<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.560> now<00:04:02.799> we<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.100> can<00:04:03.310> see<00:04:03.549> we<00:04:03.760> have<00:04:03.790> an

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
correct so now we you can see we have an

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.490 
correct so now we you can see we have an
affinity<00:04:04.390> group<00:04:04.870> with<00:04:05.530> our<00:04:06.100> icons<00:04:06.580> for<00:04:07.299> our

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
affinity group with our icons for our

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.020 
affinity group with our icons for our
applications<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.769> left-hand<00:04:09.190> side<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.700> a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
applications on the left-hand side and a

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.880 
applications on the left-hand side and a
task<00:04:10.330> bar<00:04:10.660> which<00:04:10.840> extends<00:04:11.380> right<00:04:11.530> across

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
task bar which extends right across

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.250 
task bar which extends right across
three<00:04:12.160> monitors<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:12.970> now<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.480> have<00:04:13.690> an

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
three monitors so now we have an

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.770 
three monitors so now we have an
affinity<00:04:14.650> group<00:04:15.130> we<00:04:15.459> have<00:04:15.640> effectively<00:04:16.450> one

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
affinity group we have effectively one

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.360 
affinity group we have effectively one
very<00:04:17.109> large<00:04:17.320> monitor

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
very large monitor

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.460 
very large monitor
so<00:04:18.459> if<00:04:18.729> we<00:04:18.910> look<00:04:18.940> at<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.359> display<00:04:19.840> properties

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
so if we look at the display properties

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.409 
so if we look at the display properties
we<00:04:20.889> can<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.489> we<00:04:21.609> now<00:04:21.639> have<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> screen

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
we can see that we now have a screen

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.320 
we can see that we now have a screen
resolution<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:24.419> 5760<00:04:25.419> x<00:04:26.040> 1080<00:04:27.040> which<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:28.060> three

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
resolution of 5760 x 1080 which is three

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.760 
resolution of 5760 x 1080 which is three
times<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.750> resolution<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.440> single<00:04:29.710> monitor

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
times the resolution of a single monitor

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.290 
times the resolution of a single monitor
so<00:04:32.770> let's<00:04:33.010> open<00:04:33.100> up<00:04:33.340> an<00:04:33.460> application<00:04:33.610> in

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
so let's open up an application in

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.110 
so let's open up an application in
eyefinity<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.320> it's<00:04:35.889> given<00:04:36.220> me<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.370> new<00:04:36.460> option

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
eyefinity and it's given me a new option

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.050 
eyefinity and it's given me a new option
in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.290> menu<00:04:38.590> here<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.160> run<00:04:39.400> at<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.850> full

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
resolution of 57 by 10 and as you can

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.020 
resolution of 57 by 10 and as you can
see<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.350> really<00:04:44.560> stunning<00:04:44.979> experience<00:04:45.430> to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
see it's a really stunning experience to

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.120 
see it's a really stunning experience to

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.280 
see a high resolution display right
across<00:04:48.430> three<00:04:48.639> monitors<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:50.020> we're<00:04:50.139> going<00:04:50.260> to

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
across three monitors and we're going to

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.590 
across three monitors and we're going to
show<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.590> couple<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.889> examples<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.760> games

running on this same display
configuration<00:04:57.539> okay<00:04:58.539> and<00:04:58.660> here<00:04:58.840> we<00:04:58.930> have

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
configuration okay and here we have

x 1080 so once we've set up all three

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.370 
x 1080 so once we've set up all three
monitors<00:05:05.860> into<00:05:06.550> an<00:05:06.699> eyefinity<00:05:07.270> mode<00:05:07.600> we

immersive experience than playing with

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.670 
immersive experience than playing with
just<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.300> single<00:05:33.480> monitor<00:05:36.169> so<00:05:37.169> basically<00:05:37.560> I

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
just a single monitor so basically I

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.440 
just a single monitor so basically I
finished<00:05:38.190> he<00:05:38.280> allows<00:05:38.490> us<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.850> install<00:05:39.210> just

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
finished he allows us to install just

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.629 
finished he allows us to install just
one<00:05:39.600> graphics<00:05:40.020> card<00:05:40.260> in<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.530> computer<00:05:40.980> but<00:05:41.490> to

one graphics card in the computer but to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.460 
one graphics card in the computer but to
drive<00:05:41.850> three<00:05:42.180> monitors<00:05:42.510> so<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.230> we<00:05:43.290> get<00:05:43.410> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
drive three monitors so that we get a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.990 
drive three monitors so that we get a
much<00:05:43.710> more<00:05:43.889> immersive<00:05:44.160> experience<00:05:44.880> when

much more immersive experience when

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.909 
much more immersive experience when
we're<00:05:45.150> gaming<00:05:45.360> or<00:05:45.690> much<00:05:46.169> more<00:05:46.410> productivity

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
we're gaming or much more productivity
