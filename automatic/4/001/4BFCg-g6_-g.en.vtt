throughout our history you've always
been<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.960> innovation

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.680 

it's<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.710> really<00:00:24.210> technologically<00:00:25.210> advanced

very very powerful piece of kit a camera
is<00:00:29.890> we<00:00:30.310> call<00:00:30.490> high-definition<00:00:31.300> camera<00:00:31.630> now

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
is we call high-definition camera now

is we call high-definition camera now
the<00:00:32.169> feeds<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.770> see<00:00:32.980> compared<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.550> the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
the feeds that you see compared to the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.610 
the feeds that you see compared to the
old<00:00:33.790> one<00:00:33.910> is<00:00:34.090> so<00:00:34.360> much<00:00:34.570> clearer<00:00:34.900> so<00:00:35.380> we<00:00:35.500> can

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
old one is so much clearer so we can

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.619 
old one is so much clearer so we can
really<00:00:35.830> get<00:00:36.100> down<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.489> nuances<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.120> motion

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
really get down to the nuances of motion

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.960 
really get down to the nuances of motion
we<00:00:37.750> can<00:00:37.870> really<00:00:38.050> get<00:00:38.200> down<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:39.190> body<00:00:39.640> shape

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
we can really get down to the body shape

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.700 
we can really get down to the body shape
and<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.330> movement<00:00:40.780> in<00:00:40.930> there<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.500> really

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
and the movement in there and it really

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.080 
and the movement in there and it really
opens<00:00:42.070> up<00:00:42.160> a<00:00:42.220> whole<00:00:42.309> host<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.940> new

opens up a whole host of new
opportunities<00:00:43.330> that<00:00:43.809> just<00:00:44.019> really<00:00:44.350> weren't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
opportunities that just really weren't

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.350 
opportunities that just really weren't
possible<00:00:44.920> on<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.280> previous<00:00:45.610> generation<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
possible on a previous generation the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.200 
possible on a previous generation the
sensor<00:00:46.720> itself<00:00:46.890> uses<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.220> totally<00:00:48.879> different

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
sensor itself uses a totally different

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.140 
sensor itself uses a totally different
technology<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:50.290> sense<00:00:50.620> depth<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:52.000> it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
technology to sense depth so it's

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.759 
technology to sense depth so it's
actually<00:00:52.210> measuring<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.050> speed<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.530> takes

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
actually measuring the speed it takes

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.189 
actually measuring the speed it takes
photons<00:00:54.430> of<00:00:54.610> light<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:55.089> emits<00:00:55.299> to<00:00:55.720> bounce<00:00:55.960> off

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
photons of light it emits to bounce off

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.930 
photons of light it emits to bounce off
your<00:00:56.409> body<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.010> hit<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:57.699> sensor<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.670> we

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
your body and hit the sensor on that we

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.630 
your body and hit the sensor on that we
use<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.299> thing<00:01:01.629> called<00:01:01.659> active<00:01:02.170> ir<00:01:02.500> as<00:01:03.129> well<00:01:03.370> so

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
use a thing called active ir as well so

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.240 
use a thing called active ir as well so
this<00:01:03.790> thinkin's<00:01:04.360> in<00:01:04.510> complete<00:01:05.080> darkness<00:01:05.470> we

completely dark room and that allows us

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.149 
completely dark room and that allows us
to<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.790> crazy<00:01:22.390> levels<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.380> detail<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:23.979> thing

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
to do crazy levels of detail this thing

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.460 
to do crazy levels of detail this thing
can<00:01:24.310> see<00:01:24.490> my<00:01:24.640> fingers<00:01:25.180> at<00:01:25.330> 23<00:01:25.750> meters<00:01:26.140> away

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
can see my fingers at 23 meters away

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.520 
can see my fingers at 23 meters away
from<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.979> device<00:01:27.790> original<00:01:28.750> Kinect<00:01:29.020> tracked

from the device original Kinect tracked

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.620 
from the device original Kinect tracked
about<00:01:29.710> 20<00:01:30.070> joints<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.850> people's<00:01:31.270> bodies

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
about 20 joints on to people's bodies

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.580 
about 20 joints on to people's bodies
now<00:01:32.230> we<00:01:32.290> track<00:01:32.940> 25<00:01:33.940> joints<00:01:34.660> on<00:01:34.840> six<00:01:35.260> people's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
now we track 25 joints on six people's

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.680 
now we track 25 joints on six people's

bodies the Fidelia the center allows us

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.570 
bodies the Fidelia the center allows us
to<00:01:37.990> detect<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.620> difference<00:01:38.920> between<00:01:39.040> two

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
to detect the difference between two

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.490 
to detect the difference between two

hand positions that almost to the naked

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.350 
hand positions that almost to the naked
eye<00:01:41.710> look<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:41.950> same<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:42.730> something<00:01:43.180> we

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
eye look the same it's something we

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.940 
eye look the same it's something we
couldn't<00:01:43.630> do<00:01:43.690> before<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.080> we<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.620> do<00:01:44.800> now

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
couldn't do before that we can do now

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
couldn't do before that we can do now
and<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.340> picks<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.790> more<00:01:46.450> or<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.810> be<00:01:46.990> more

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
and it picks up more or to be more

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
body rig on your face rake so we scan

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.670

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
then we send that up to the cloud and we

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.860 
then we send that up to the cloud and we
make<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.400> available<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.880> every<00:04:33.360> other<00:04:33.540> player
