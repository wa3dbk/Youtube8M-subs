00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.140
 then I am rectifier, that is to say 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.130
 engine building technicians 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.169
 thermal and organ 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.419
 so that's about making the discount 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.949
 Engine state is working hard on 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.869
 light vehicles and vehicles 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.840
 every day we have a lot of vehicles 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.740
 utilities of industrial vehicles from 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.130
 Generator 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.600
 starting to work in 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.480
 old vehicles when you have an engine 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 which happens we will dismount it clean 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.360
 we will do what we call the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 So the metrology room control 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.270
 that we will measure a level of 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.000
 diagnoses we will watch the wear 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.170
 nickname parts wear on some 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.570
 engines the distributions breaks and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.740
 others is often one controls 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.060
 valves or thank valves of 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.190
 tense of possible crises that may 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.570
 to be broken and then we will launch the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.490
 following works the life of the customer 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.230
 we will start the machining and after their 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.090
 engine mount there are controls 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.160
 visuals but after there are checks 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.020
 with devices it will be the measure 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.450
 it's an exciting job to put back 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.160
 able to say that we stop 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.910
 change parts that eventually 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.910
 can be repaired 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 the actions and wallowing get started summer 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.620
 set up in the company 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.150
 especially at the sorting level 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.100
 the boxes of the land district that 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.610
 have stained deciphering shoe level 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.770
 of recovery 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.870
 the batteries at the level obviously of the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 repair of hydrocarbons 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.310
 next step 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.690
 sorede engaged a little an investment 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 to recover the rainwater that 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.290
 could meet our needs of 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.760
 crisis cleansing with means of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 storage from way enough 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.630
 interesting to say that we could 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.760
 fix something we saved 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
 something and we have to 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:04.619
 throw them give a second life to the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.330
 piece in the training integrates 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.630
 directly sustainable development 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.820
 we have a job that is in 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.770
 does the recycling of the raw material 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.540
 which is actually an engine so the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.680
 trainees come 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.520
 in the same way we will say to get involved in 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.760
 this approach 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.160
 I simply support by analyzing 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.270
 all the wear of an engine all 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.100
 the different crates that we can 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.410
 recycle the builder provided for 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.700
 ribs repair so in connection with 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.530
 manufacturer documents 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.260
 trainees search the guide codes of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.780
 repair and will be able to adapt its 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 pieces by getting the pieces so these 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 pieces are going to be directly reinstated 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.190
 in the circuit 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.330
 that is, we do not need to 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 matter of works the material must 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.630
 to go already existing we do not have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.360
 need to go get the material 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.780
 first we put it back directly circuit 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.610
 so economically viable month of 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 waste - 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.570
 a rather interesting economic cost 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.770
 but everything that flows behind by 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.290
 compared to the water this purpose I them 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.090
 sensitize to the recycling of these liquids 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.470
 who will start again in a circuit the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.990
 trainees will not let either 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 machine was turning itself so a 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.820
 awareness so we'll tell 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.890
 time-related energy savings 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.440
 of use the spammers machine 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.020
 turns and we'll say alone so 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.700
 save the maximum energy the 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.700
 engine operation the performance of the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 engine is directly impacted by this 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.450
 setting so it's going to be a motor that's going 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.490
 more consumed an engine that will be less 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.140
 powerful less power more than 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.880
 poor performance of the engine 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140
 we end up with an engine that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.510
 pollute be a player in development 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.290
 durable for a technician 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.820
 reconstructors a technician 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.620
 thermal engine rebuilders 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.959
 and organs it's for the dimension 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.820
 environmental savings 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.010
 of energy material and components 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.170
 by replacing only those 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.060
 defective parts is to participate in 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.590
 the depollution of the engines by regulating the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.780
 valve clearance for dimension 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.550
 economic is reducing the cost of 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.200
 repair by rehabilitating 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.790
 pieces instead of replacing them it's 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.160
 propose remediation solutions 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.880
 complete by guaranteeing the quality of 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.739
 the service 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.269
 to be a player in sustainable development 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.590
 for the social dimension it is 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.239
 to preserve a manual profession 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.650
 traditional training 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.690
 young people is fighting against 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.380
 discrimination by promoting equality 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.380
 men women
