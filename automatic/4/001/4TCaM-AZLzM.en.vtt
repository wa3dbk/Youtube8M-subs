this is the k-6 tu iPad app and I'm

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.070 
this is the k-6 tu iPad app and I'm
going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.850> demonstrate<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.420> working<00:00:06.899> with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the support SDR application so we'll

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
the support SDR application so we'll
begin<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> basic<00:00:36.270> things<00:00:36.540> what

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
begin with some of the basic things what

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.750 
begin with some of the basic things what
you<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> blue<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.250> slice

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you see here in the blue is a slice

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.830 
you see here in the blue is a slice
receiver<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.399> channel<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> receive

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840

as<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.520> hear<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> foreign<00:01:03.539> station

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
as you hear this is a foreign station

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
as you hear this is a foreign station
I'm<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> mute<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> again<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I'm going to mute it again so that you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
I'm going to mute it again so that you
can<00:01:08.430> hear<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.180> what's<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.979> also

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
can hear what what's going on you also

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
can hear what what's going on you also
have<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> ability<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.030> type<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.600> frequency<00:01:13.229> if

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
have the ability to type in frequency if

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.060 
have the ability to type in frequency if
you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.280> by<00:01:14.430> double<00:01:14.760> tapping<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
you want to just by double tapping and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
you want to just by double tapping and
you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.460> type<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> frequency<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you can just type in the frequency that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
you can just type in the frequency that
you<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.619> application<00:01:20.460> hit<00:01:21.210> return

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you want on the application hit return

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.340 
you want on the application hit return
and<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.960> notice<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.619> corresponds<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
and you notice that it corresponds to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
and you notice that it corresponds to
14.3<00:01:25.350> megahertz<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.909> had<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> ability<00:01:27.420> also

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
14.3 megahertz you had the ability also

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
14.3 megahertz you had the ability also
to<00:01:28.110> change<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> band<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
to change the band so this is a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
to change the band so this is a
different<00:01:30.659> radio<00:01:31.020> frequency<00:01:31.560> spectrum<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
different radio frequency spectrum that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.469 
different radio frequency spectrum that
you<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> ability<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.470> change<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:35.479> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you have the ability to change to you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
you have the ability to change to you
have<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> ability<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.590> change<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
have the ability to change the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.319 
have the ability to change the
modulation<00:01:38.729> type<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.750> band<00:01:40.020> happens<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> use

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
modulation type this band happens to use

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
modulation type this band happens to use
lower<00:01:42.329> sideband<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> LSB<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
lower sideband which is LSB on the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
lower sideband which is LSB on the
application<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.390> notice<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> filter

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
application you notice that the filter

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
application you notice that the filter
changed<00:01:47.070> over<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> left<00:01:47.759> hand<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:48.530> you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
changed over to the left hand side you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950 
changed over to the left hand side you
can<00:01:49.710> change<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> receive<00:01:50.610> antenna<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
can change the receive antenna so it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.649 
can change the receive antenna so it's
presently<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> antenna<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:54.329> change<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
presently on antenna one I can change to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.569 
presently on antenna one I can change to
receive<00:01:55.170> antenna<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> only
