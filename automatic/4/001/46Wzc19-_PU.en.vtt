00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.230
 there is a very complex issue and it is if the country invest in the gray agenda fly 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.019
 in the network the engineers are going to say that it explodes that is to build dams 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.919
 cheek month 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.130
 civil works I do not know that I do not know when 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.930
 environmentalists I think that a good part of the works is more right and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.640
 that relocate ecosystem restoration 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 noura engineering 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 control the water 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.770
 vicente 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.620
 rejected any type of violence and any complicity with groups 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 margin of law and with officials or corrupt citizens 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.500
 respect for life 3 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.810
 transparent and efficient management of public resources as resources 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.470
 sacred 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.700
 4 incorporation in public and private decisions 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 of the forecast and management of environmental consequences 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.050
 then removed primacy of general interest over private interest 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 respect and defense the political constitution recognition and evaluation 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370
 of differences and plurality 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.100
 Thursday between ends and methods not everything goes and build on the built 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.780
 looking with the greatest rigor and the greatest possible objectivity the eastern tunnel 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.210
 It is not 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 priority for antioquia today 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 to say that it is not a priority does not have to be against development 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.510
 but there for the observations that we have to take into account it has to be 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.460
 clarify the issue the environmental license for any particular work to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.190
 to be 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.380
 for any work all 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.950
 we have to be clear about what will happen if we open a tunnel here in 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 this mountain Medellin is not ready to have that tunnel 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.939
 Eastern Antioquia does not have the territorial order and capacity 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.159
 to receive that tunnel that will happen if that is not done because it is not 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.449
 there will be the tunnel and we will see later what happens not for that is called planning for 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.659
 do not improvise if we 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.569
 venturelli we throw all this to the small east the eastern Antioquia goes to 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.409
 be devastated because then neither the native people of the small east 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 hit exculpatory covers a new periphery 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.209
 the second department with more coast on the Caribbean is antioquia after 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.279
 the guajira 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.819
 and it is paradoxical that the Caribbean is not thought of as part of the department 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.779
 antioquia 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.319
 where is the greatest natural wealth is the greatest poverty in our 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.279
 Department 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:55.450
 and that fundamentally has obeyed several circumstances but it has been a 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.529
 development model that goes little in very simple terms 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
 they are going to take out wealth and poverty 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.759
 I do not believe 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.669
 in the panamericana they break the cap of dariÃ©n myths that I am governor that 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.109
 it will not happen 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.069
 and a paradox in our department as in Colombia but in our 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.669
 department where we have a wealth of water 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.529
 there are many municipalities that lack aqueduct water and do not have a good 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:28.180
 basic sanitation is a mandatory task for us as a project 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.889
 region 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.029
 necessary for others 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.309
 we have to advance in the construction table of that port for uraba 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.370
 that will be fundamental in the connection with Central America as it was 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.459
 saying
