00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.390
 I 've discovered something again and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 Although I have my last video 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.139
 found that was a bit yes 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.950
 good thing in our video picture inside 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.420
 from my mobile phone and that was 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 so consumed a bit and the colors 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 were not that dangerous that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.140
 build number can not be so right 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
 recognize 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.010
 but you know about how and then 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 is that a bit diagonal 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.449
 distorted and until you see the logo 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 So this picture has been taken here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 I had to bring on the screen 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 lighters with it is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 was about in a line and there 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 it certainly better alternatives 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 and the better alternative he is called 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.309

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.489
