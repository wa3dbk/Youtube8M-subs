00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello I am but with the movie and welcome 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 to my channel 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.570
 in this master class I will show you how 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.460
 perform pendant in the technique of flower 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 filigree that allows you to create 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 fine detailed jewelery from 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 polymer clay 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.770
 the very word filigree from latin 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 means thread and grain and work in this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 technique requires much attention so 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.699
 how very tiny as I didn't know 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 what color do i need in 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.679
 I decided to take a big job right away 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.160
 polymer clay set in me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
 need a tool for modeling 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.020
 blade to cut plastic 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 gel liquid plastic frame which 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.760
 can be both metal and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.829
 made of polymer clay 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.750
 assembly tools and fittings i 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.579
 I take a piece of bright red plastic 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 I select the size suitable for the frame 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.510
 I put on the frame the gel liquid plastic 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.989
 which will function here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.629
 glue 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 put a red piece on top and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.799
 smoothing his promka smooth 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.720
 fingers to leave no fingerprints 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.729
 acute needles put the main elements 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.729
 the picture that I want to perform 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.070
 I roll a thin sausage and cut it into 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.640
 equal parts 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 each of the parts I roll into a ball and each 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 the ball in a droplet these droplets and will 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.000
 elements of filigree modeling 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.670
 I pick up a little bit with a tool 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 and placed on the surface of the pendant is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.530
 there will be petals flower pay 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.600
 attention exactly how do I fix them on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 pendant 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 after that i take beige plastic 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.579
 I roll a thin sausage and cut into 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 parts smaller each of the parts roll 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.969
 a ball and then a bit 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 and these droplets are a modeling tool 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.039
 I place on the pendant this will be the second 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.719
 row of sv. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.289
 then take a small piece of gold 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.300
 colors I roll a thin thin sausage 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.209
 less often it is altogether altogether 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.290
 small each this piece kata in 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.030
 ball ball 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.599
 tiny little bit and place the third 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.599
 layer of petals 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.049
 tweezers take glue straszinku 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.900
 and placing it in the center of the flower it will be it 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.269
 the middle glue rhinestones are good because 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.400
 under the influence of temperature they themselves 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.430
 stick to the surface will not need 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.590
 get them and glue I performed 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.470
 flower now I want to make a small 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.810
 twig and leaves for this I took 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.329
 mixed green and slice 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.180
 Golden I rolled out of these two colors 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.390
 long sausages and sliced ​​into small 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.739
 parts of each of the parts I roll first in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.049
 the ball then a bit 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.660
 and these droplets I fix in the form 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.160
 sprigs the arrangement of this sprig i 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.389
 originally painted 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.310
 the sharp end of the needle now i want 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.410
 make bigger leaves 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.530
 I take a bigger piece of gold 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.840
 I roll a ball into a droplet and this 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.480
 a bit flatten out on the fingertip 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.450
 I get the shape of a leaflet on 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.180
 which side of the blade I draw 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.850
 streamers modeling tool i 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.070
 place a leaf on the pendant 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.410
 then I perform the second leaf and 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.960
 I place next to the work looked 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.690
 more detailed more volumetric i 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.960
 I make a few more leaves around the edges 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.960
 St. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.500
 and posting some more white ones 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.330
 petals and then the frame with 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.610
 ready to bake 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.450
 temperature and duration 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.610
 roasting look on the package 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.910
 polymer clay from which you sculpt 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.550
 after the pendant baked it need 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.370
 assemble for mounting I chose the base 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.440
 for hanging silver I'm her 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.140
 fastened with tools on 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.959
 a ring with a pendant on top and I want it from below 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.930
 fix the beads for this I collect them 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.650
 on the pin for 1 pin for three beads 2 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.960
 whites and one red and then everything and 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.960
 fastened at the bottom of the pendant on the ring 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.380
 threading the pendant chain is ready and mine 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.850
 turned out the original graceful 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.190
 detailed pendant 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.370
 this technique can do work 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.190
 any difficulty choose any shades and 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.440
 color combinations it all depends on 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.510
 your fantasy after i 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.729
 fulfilled this pendant I wanted 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.000
 make the same but more gentle 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.090
 shades result you see yourself wish 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.860
 you creative success and inspiration
