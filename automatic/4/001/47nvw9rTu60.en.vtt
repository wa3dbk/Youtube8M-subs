00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
for inator 4 in 4 out so how you can use

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
for inator 4 in 4 out so how you can use
combine<00:01:21.210> both<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.290> L<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.619> L

an<00:02:04.020> aggregate<00:02:04.140> device<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.259> name<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
an aggregate device now I can name it to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.740 
an aggregate device now I can name it to
whatever<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.459> I'll<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
whatever I want I'll say more to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.420 
whatever I want I'll say more to
sound<00:02:13.220> cards<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:16.650> pane<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.220> can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
sound cards on the right pane I can

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.119 
sound cards on the right pane I can
select<00:02:18.120> which<00:02:18.659> devices<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.950> combine

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
select which devices I want to combine

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.429 
select which devices I want to combine
so<00:02:20.879> I've<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> bunch<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.540> devices<00:02:22.019> over<00:02:22.230> here

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
so I've got a bunch of devices over here

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.750 
so I've got a bunch of devices over here
including<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.159> built-in<00:02:23.579> digital

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
including the built-in digital

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.610 
including the built-in digital
input/output<00:02:24.360> line<00:02:24.780> output<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.290> combine

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
input/output line output you can combine

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.199 
input/output line output you can combine
as<00:02:25.769> many<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.189> you<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.030> example

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
as many as you want but for this example

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.300 
as many as you want but for this example
we'll<00:02:27.659> just<00:02:27.689> combine<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> two<00:02:28.739> sound<00:02:29.010> cards

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
we'll just combine the two sound cards

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.819 
we'll just combine the two sound cards
so<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.299> will<00:02:30.390> select<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> 8<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.200> 8<00:02:31.349> mark<00:02:31.590> -

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
so one I will select the 8 to 8 mark -

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.789 
so one I will select the 8 to 8 mark -
and<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:33.269> second<00:02:33.659> one<00:02:33.689> travela<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:36.060> now<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.799> have

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
and the second one travela so now I have

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.470 
and the second one travela so now I have
the<00:02:37.920> 8<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.250> 8<00:02:38.370> mark<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.760> end<00:02:38.879> motor<00:02:39.060> traveler

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the 8 to 8 mark to end motor traveler

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.630
