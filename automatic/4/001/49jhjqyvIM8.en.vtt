00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
you should play so of course the only

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.530 
you should play so of course the only
goal<00:02:54.590> was<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.980> beat<00:02:55.130> Alda<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:56.120> also<00:02:56.300> knew

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
goal was to beat Alda and we also knew

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.699 
goal was to beat Alda and we also knew
how<00:02:56.570> difficult<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.170> was<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> be

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
how difficult that was going to be

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.070 
how difficult that was going to be
because<00:02:57.860> they<00:02:58.300> they<00:02:59.300> gave<00:02:59.510> us<00:02:59.690> an<00:02:59.810> incredible

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
because they they gave us an incredible

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.310 
because they they gave us an incredible
lesson<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.010> in<00:03:01.280> Berlin<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> month<00:03:01.940> ago<00:03:02.320> I

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
lesson in that in Berlin a month ago I

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840 
lesson in that in Berlin a month ago I
think<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.980> couple<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.310> things<00:03:04.489> we've<00:03:04.640> made<00:03:04.820> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
think a couple of things we've made a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.310 
think a couple of things we've made a
big<00:03:04.940> difference<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.510> think<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.780> rebounding<00:03:06.200> was

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
big difference I think a rebounding was

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.520 
big difference I think a rebounding was
definitely<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.769> factor<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.200> second

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
definitely a factor and in the second

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.050 
definitely a factor and in the second
half<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:09.890> got<00:03:10.880> big<00:03:11.060> rebounds<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:12.820> we<00:03:13.820> did<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
half we got big rebounds and we did a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.610 
half we got big rebounds and we did a
little<00:03:14.360> bit<00:03:14.510> better<00:03:14.600> job<00:03:14.900> getting<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.410> in

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
little bit better job getting in the in

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.250 
little bit better job getting in the in
the<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.070> their<00:03:16.430> Lane<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:17.600> not<00:03:17.720> saying<00:03:17.930> we<00:03:18.110> did

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the in their Lane I'm not saying we did

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.470 
the in their Lane I'm not saying we did
a<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:18.739> good<00:03:18.860> job<00:03:18.980> finishing<00:03:19.850> in<00:03:20.150> their<00:03:20.299> late

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
a very good job finishing in their late

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.630 
a very good job finishing in their late
in<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.440> second<00:03:21.799> half<00:03:21.830> we<00:03:22.250> could<00:03:22.280> get<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
in the second half we could get the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.789 
in the second half we could get the
basketball<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.180> little<00:03:23.510> bit<00:03:23.600> more<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
basketball a little bit more in the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.100 
basketball a little bit more in the
heart<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.100> their<00:03:25.220> defense<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.720> then<00:03:26.930> with

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
heart of their defense and and then with

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.259 
heart of their defense and and then with
our<00:03:27.170> shooters<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.790> have<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.120> make<00:03:29.239> a

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
our shooters you have to make a

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.330 
our shooters you have to make a
defensive<00:03:29.780> choice<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.980> first<00:03:31.130> half

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
defensive choice and in the first half

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.640 
defensive choice and in the first half
then<00:03:31.630> they<00:03:32.630> just<00:03:32.840> push<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.170> out<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.500> they

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
then they just push this out and they

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.080 
then they just push this out and they
rotate<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.370> from<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.549> weak<00:03:34.700> side<00:03:34.730> very

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
rotate it from the weak side very

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.390 
rotate it from the weak side very
smartly<00:03:35.540> and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
smartly and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220 
smartly and
we<00:03:36.970> couldn't<00:03:37.390> we<00:03:37.510> couldn't<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.079> those

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
we couldn't we couldn't do that so those

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.479 
we couldn't we couldn't do that so those
are<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.379> two<00:03:38.439> changes<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.129> second<00:03:39.400> half

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
are the two changes in the second half

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.939 
upholds the values that stands for you
can<00:04:16.630> also<00:04:16.930> play<00:04:17.289> with<00:04:17.320> maybe<00:04:17.680> less

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
can also play with maybe less

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.409 
can also play with maybe less
experienced<00:04:18.430> players<00:04:18.639> or<00:04:18.850> maybe<00:04:19.030> less<00:04:19.239> down

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
experienced players or maybe less down

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.340 
experienced players or maybe less down
but<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.810> still<00:04:20.139> play<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.289> good<00:04:20.440> game<00:04:21.210> so<00:04:22.350> it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
but you still play a good game so it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.930 
but you still play a good game so it
helps<00:04:23.710> when<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.949> are<00:04:24.070> deep<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.760> not
