 good afternoon to all friends came to work 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.239
 from China 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.729
 To be honest, there’s generally a misunderstanding that 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 here why because it is written here 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.000
 me 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.269
 set top box some sort of something is 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.969
 nothing and I know that it seems to me I 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.719
 guess again this is free 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.210
 intermediaries 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.509
 a man ordered from me here rather 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 all type 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:07.899
 do you need more such a santin 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.909
 kite that is necessary 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:14.799
 routine powerful if written boxing but 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.039
 only this one because i'm nothing 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.350
 I didn't take a turn for myself 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.479
 if I ordered a multimedia smarka 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 player on android and all right 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.000
 came box cheers 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.580
 man really believed me at all 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.679
 people know who know people share 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 on 2 types of those who are worried about 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.560
 package and those that are not particularly experienced 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 for your package 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.799
 so here is the guy from ordered from me right away 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.640
 several amount positions there were by 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.060
 my is more than 1200 dollars 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.140
 speak shorter is not a small amount 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.959
 pretty there was somewhere around 60 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
 my general is that they are clearly told 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.649
 counted everything without any commission 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.050
 were like this so you send money 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.509
 I am making an order today and are waiting for you soon 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.369
 yes will be well well, you know the amount of 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.489
 big search honestly everything would be there 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.040
 thought ordering order not order a 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.870
 send him a day not send him 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.239
 do not steamed about it damn 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.750
 see how well people trust 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.340
 it's generally awesome to be honest so 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 neatly is not a topic that is all 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.180
 today or tomorrow and sent with him 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.390
 contact 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.760
 That's the thing I took about him I 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 I'll ask Rossini if ​​he doesn't mind me 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.470
 test her elki test 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.080
 in short, we have a way out 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.930
 To charge the audio output, I understand from 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.800
 d &amp; g connect now outlived with dima 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 small usb and internet so far 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 Chach means this still knocking will support 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.000
 Wi-Fi one byte operative 8 built-in 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.870
 memory recovery button to reset 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 all principle cooling we have here 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.050
 we can still insert tf cards 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 micro sd 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.100
 we have another coat of arms 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.870
 not turning on the idea that the sensor is lit 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.250
 the prefix is on and so on so ok 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 all figured it out let's see 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.060
 what else do we have bundled for this 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.120
 I will show this sensor to all the good 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.010
 that he is the oldest for the remote 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.220
 infrared port yes see socket 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.780
 we already had food for 2000 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.500
 milliampere so remote we have 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.410
 control 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.910
 that is, everything is thought out at all 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.700
 know if some deshmansky 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.260
 are buying 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.050
 these are the players here this is no remote for me 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.850
 nifiga no i mean it's all thought out 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.370
 everything is complete here everything is beautiful 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:09.500
 the figure will be batteries in my opinion just 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:11.300
 be light and solder batteries here well 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.630
 yes of course we are Chinese batteries 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.160
 Unworthy but bought a prize confused buy 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.940
 the battery itself bought it myself buy it this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.540
 by so okay let's go look further 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.950
 we have tulips with you 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.440
 audio output connects like this 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:37.070
 audio output actually alone she is not really 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.200
 audio because yellow and white are going the same 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.500
 what's the sound like red on video yes 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.740
 if I'm not mistaken, such wires know 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.040
 they seem to be but they are not as powerful 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.620
 decrepit and of course hd 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.169

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.839

 we have a smart media instruction 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.499
 player 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.499
 Well, I think the instruction is not worth well 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:14.819
 what's on completely in chinese but in 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:18.629

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:22.080
