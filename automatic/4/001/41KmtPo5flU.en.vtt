00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.200 
and to be honest i don't use anything
from<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.500> brand<00:01:47.740> it's<00:01:48.460> not<00:01:48.610> really<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> brand

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
from this brand it's not really a brand

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.940 
from this brand it's not really a brand
that<00:01:49.270> interest<00:01:49.690> me<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:49.870> much<00:01:50.020> but<00:01:50.740> when<00:01:50.920> I

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that interest me that much but when I

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.820 
that interest me that much but when I
saw<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.250> adverts<00:01:51.670> for<00:01:51.760> this<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.240> looked

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
saw the adverts for this it looked

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.960 
saw the adverts for this it looked
amazingly<00:01:53.830> different<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.610> thought<00:01:54.820> you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
amazingly different and I thought you

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.760 
amazingly different and I thought you
know<00:01:55.030> what<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.390> might<00:01:55.540> be<00:01:55.690> really<00:01:55.869> good<00:01:56.170> so

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
know what it might be really good so

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.450 
know what it might be really good so
this<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.340> their<00:01:57.580> extravagant<00:01:58.180> lashes<00:01:59.190> and<00:02:00.190> it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
this is their extravagant lashes and it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.609 
this is their extravagant lashes and it
comes<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.940> brush<00:02:01.180> which<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.049> really<00:02:02.320> strange

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
comes in a brush which is really strange

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.300 
comes in a brush which is really strange
it's<00:02:03.580> um<00:02:04.229> square<00:02:05.229> brush<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.040> not<00:02:06.159> your

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's um square brush so it's not your

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.749

typical<00:02:06.490> round<00:02:07.000> brush<00:02:07.540> on<00:02:08.250> yeah<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> square

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
typical round brush on yeah a square

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.740 
typical round brush on yeah a square
shape<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.470> plastic<00:02:11.860> bristles<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.819> its

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
shape and the plastic bristles and its

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.690 
shape and the plastic bristles and its
really<00:02:14.049> strange-looking<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.459> kind<00:02:15.640> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
really strange-looking it kind of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.910 
really strange-looking it kind of
reminds<00:02:16.000> me<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.240> Chinese<00:02:17.050> rooftops<00:02:17.620> on

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
reminds me of like Chinese rooftops on

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.300 
reminds me of like Chinese rooftops on
the<00:02:18.040> house

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the house

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
the house
is<00:02:18.400> um<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.840> yeah<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.260> thought<00:02:20.440> I'd<00:02:20.560> give<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.860> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
is um but yeah I thought I'd give that I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.270 
is um but yeah I thought I'd give that I
go<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.480> say<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:23.020> really<00:02:23.560> really

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
go and I have to say I really really

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.130 
go and I have to say I really really
like<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> idea<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> shape<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.599> find<00:02:26.020> that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
like the idea of the shape I find that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.809 
like the idea of the shape I find that
it<00:02:26.260> gets<00:02:26.380> really<00:02:26.709> close<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:27.520> really

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
it gets really close you can get really

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.330 
it gets really close you can get really
close<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.180> lash<00:02:28.450> line<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.920> allows<00:02:30.160> you

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
close to the lash line and it allows you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.250 
close to the lash line and it allows you
to<00:02:30.459> separate<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> lashes<00:02:31.030> really<00:02:31.510> well<00:02:31.690> but

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
to separate the lashes really well but

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.130 
to separate the lashes really well but
the<00:02:32.410> formulation<00:02:33.099> is<00:02:33.310> rubbish<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:34.599> rubbish

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
the formulation is rubbish like rubbish

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.740 
the formulation is rubbish like rubbish
it<00:02:35.440> really<00:02:35.680> clumps<00:02:36.099> your<00:02:36.280> lashes<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:37.480> really

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it really clumps your lashes it's really

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.860 
it really clumps your lashes it's really
wet<00:02:38.050> um<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.000> don't<00:02:40.180> really<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
wet um and I just don't really like it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
wet um and I just don't really like it
it's<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.050> shame<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.769> brush<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.099> a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
it's a shame because the brush is a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.820 
it's a shame because the brush is a
really<00:02:42.459> clever<00:02:42.640> idea<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.260> yeah<00:02:44.410> anyway

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
really clever idea and but yeah anyway

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.000 
really clever idea and but yeah anyway
that<00:02:45.519> was<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.450> then<00:02:46.690> also<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.440> went<00:02:47.769> to

that was that and then also I went to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.880 
that was that and then also I went to
the<00:02:48.400> Smashbox<00:02:49.209> counter<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.959> my<00:02:50.560> local

actually<00:03:35.200> really<00:03:35.530> worked<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:35.890> well<00:03:35.980> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
actually really worked really well and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.979 
actually really worked really well and
gave<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.400> really<00:03:36.730> nice<00:03:36.880> color<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:37.569> one<00:03:37.750> my

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
gave a really nice color but this one my

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.900 
gave a really nice color but this one my
own<00:03:38.290> one<00:03:38.590> doesn't<00:03:39.190> do<00:03:39.250> anything<00:03:39.519> doesn't<00:03:39.730> even

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
own one doesn't do anything doesn't even

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.539 
own one doesn't do anything doesn't even
change<00:03:40.209> color<00:03:40.480> doesn't<00:03:40.810> make<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> difference

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
change color doesn't make a difference

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.670
