 I was saying that I didn't know well before that, maybe it's a battery 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.770

 It It is thin, such as Moteru easily to the other true I do not know what can be seen with their own hands 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.460
 It's an introduction , so it's a late minute to get up 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.810
 Really in such a 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.810
 Do not worry about time 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:50.660
 Let's go one more time 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:57.680
 Because it will still take a long time at the first start, you will have to do settings etc. 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:03.740
 Let's start the public festival one more time and check the speed of its rise 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:08.650
 Well this is a little personally entered and another one anon 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.650
 You will see the speed of the orbit 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.430
 So to from this state 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.920
 And those of REBOOT 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.340

 It looks like this 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.290
 How long has it gone 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.290
 I wonder if it's been about another minute 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.070
 Is it about a minute or so 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.820

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.820

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.340
 Yes 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.340
 I came back to the start screen 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.960
 Or let's launch you browser little to say 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.910
 I just started a little, so I feel more confident 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.380
 Hey That's right 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.380
 It is like this 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.740
 Something like this 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.330
 Such to such stressful Well 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.280
 Maybe not late 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:54.000
 Well a little 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.840
 I Naa reasonably early and get to say from me that had bought so reasonably low-space path pants 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.430

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.100
 Yup 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:05.030
 It's a feeling, so it's about what is actually going down 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.840
 Try using the future 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:15.410
 I will report again if there is something you have 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.400
 Well, I feel like that, anyway, it's small and compact, and it seems easy to carry. 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.280
 Feeling 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.270
 eh 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.270
 I feel good 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:35.440
 Well, the price is 40,000 yen and 3,000 yen, so the cheapest place 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:38.100
 And I want to quickly try to use to look forward to but we have bought went there a little direct 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.100
