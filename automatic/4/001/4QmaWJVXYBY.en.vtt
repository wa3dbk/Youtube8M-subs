00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:12.660
 Hello everyone, well, even though I was not going to 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.860
 no repair videos i shoot but 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.020
 here today 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.860
 drove 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:27.190
 not exactly drove and I myself rolled it on 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:37.120
 repair moped alpha 110 cubes stopped 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:42.610
 wind up the escape of 376 kilometers grandfather 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 the owner returned to the store on the guys with 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.370
 I was asked to look at the store 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 what with the moped but now we will look 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 cause and trying to start it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.870
 that's like the layout 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:06.670
 stood motionless pretty well 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:13.830
 battery for power, I immediately put on 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:17.759
 Charging at the same time look at all the contacts 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.759
 afi often 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:29.410
 where is that thing just 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.410
 kontachit further according to the standard scheme 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:42.440
 I twist the candle, we can only eat 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:44.890
 First of all, let's check 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.890
 sparks 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.500
 sparks 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.690
 just not on the candle now try for 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.690
 checking another 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:23.040
 something to slip but rather rarely well 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.400
 and further according to the scheme checking bar about 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 of himself 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.550
 so let's go let's go 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:53.810
 came took the cap on the floor was not good 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 for now we will look for the reason that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.870
 remove the ignition coil 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.010
 my as there are two reason fixed and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:26.030
 at the same time I will try to deliver 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:28.840
 obviously working inconvenience on the course 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.840
 worth pulling 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.680
 what to do 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.750
 . 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.750
 need to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.220
 can panic as always 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:56.710
 Well I looked great we will try 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:59.640
 to start this business is most likely a matter of how 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.640
 would under testament 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:17.790
 yes as it turned out idiotic acid 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.140
 appeared and disappeared 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.440
 of course nothing so clever i'm not 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.760
 just showed was as they say 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.840
 coil in stock 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.550
 i went to says katya tickling than by 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.550
 checked the spark 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:40.860
 there was no changed candle checked spark on 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:44.670
 slaughter about the occasion already separately sincerely here 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.940
 it is clear as the chain and I would go 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.230
 something more complicated might be 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.660
 more interesting than rich so glad 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:58.490
 took it all 15 now fasten 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.000
 all back i drive him to the store and there 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.640
 guys for my ignition coil 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.940
 how would I pay money for the work I 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.570
 Naturally will not take and you are not here 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.980
 no work in principle was not well 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.420
 To be honest, even a shame 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.340
 minor breakdown 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:26.280
 I rolled it from the store through the village 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.060
 longer than repairing i.e. 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.280
 the reason was only in the ignition coil 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:37.170
 why she periodically tried 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:40.590
 Kutaisi issue well what wanted to do 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:45.990
 make some good video but unfortunately 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.480
 failed as the reason for plan one 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.660
 very quickly and well, it is clear that simply 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:57.690
 Ignition coils are available therefore 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:59.139
 I'm just stupid shouts well, although it was clear 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.599
 that truly was 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:06.930
 and it's worth it 30 way to look for it 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:12.060
 parallel was not the wire itself 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:17.490
 the coil was checked by replacing and 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.900
 it turned out but I will leave the roofs collect and 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:24.580
 drove 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:27.689
 return the model 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.689
 test run 

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:41.879
 everything works really to be happy 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:47.099
 moped and nebula warranties and itâ€™s just 

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:52.509
 returned working friends to removal store 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:54.729
 asked to see , unfortunately, how 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:57.150
 I have already said nothing informative in 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:00.189
 this video will not be 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:03.960
 updated the replacement of the ignition coil just 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.960
 Good luck everyone, bye everyone
