the gel that is whitening your teeth

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
really stays in place and nothing moves

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.700 
really stays in place and nothing moves
around<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.270> don't<00:01:19.750> even<00:01:20.050> taste<00:01:20.289> it
