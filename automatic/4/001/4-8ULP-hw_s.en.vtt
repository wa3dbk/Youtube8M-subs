00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000 

next<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.940> smooth<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.840> hair<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.800> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
next I smooth up my hair so that I can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210 
next I smooth up my hair so that I can
get<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.370> in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.790> ponytail<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> say

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
get it in a ponytail and I have to say

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
get it in a ponytail and I have to say
that<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.520> hair<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:08.940> previously<00:01:09.860> blow-dried

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that my hair was previously blow-dried

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.860 
that my hair was previously blow-dried
and<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.550> twist<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.210> blow-dry<00:01:12.600> hair

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
and it was a twist I don't blow-dry hair

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.830 
and it was a twist I don't blow-dry hair
so<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.410> lot<00:01:13.620> easier<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.370> me<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
so it's a lot easier for me to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.430 
so it's a lot easier for me to
manipulate<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.440> and<00:01:16.650> smooth<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.310> up

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
manipulate it and smooth it up

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.300 
manipulate it and smooth it up
regardless<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.800> hair<00:01:20.010> is<00:01:20.130> doing

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
regardless of what your hair is doing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.280 
regardless of what your hair is doing
and<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.660> into<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.960> ponytail

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and just get it up into a ponytail

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:37.500 
and just get it up into a ponytail
however<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> can

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.640 

oh<00:01:37.540> right<00:01:38.470> now<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:39.070> thought<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:39.400> was<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.590> okay<00:01:41.590> so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
oh right now I thought I was you okay so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.610 
oh right now I thought I was you okay so
take<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.760> hair<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.000> just<00:01:43.360> kind<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.200> smooth<00:01:44.440> it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
take the hair and just kind of smooth it

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.890 
take the hair and just kind of smooth it
over<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.520> ponytail<00:01:46.150> all<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.050> way<00:01:47.170> around

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
over the ponytail all the way around

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.720 
over the ponytail all the way around
grab<00:01:49.900> that<00:01:50.080> first<00:01:50.380> section<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:51.010> hair<00:01:51.430> and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
grab that first section of hair and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.260 
grab that first section of hair and
twist<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:53.020> at<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.590> bottom<00:01:53.800> I<00:01:54.250> find<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.120> this

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
twist it at the bottom I find that this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.800 
twist it at the bottom I find that this
is<00:01:55.330> just<00:01:55.660> easier<00:01:55.870> for<00:01:56.380> me<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.950> roll<00:01:57.850> under<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
is just easier for me to roll under and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:12.619 
is just easier for me to roll under and
pin<00:01:59.200> as<00:01:59.650> opposed<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.060> grabbing<00:02:01.060> loose<00:02:01.240> hair

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.559 

move<00:02:13.629> on<00:02:13.810> over<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.470> next<00:02:14.830> side<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.849> repeat

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
move on over to the next side and repeat

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.520 
move on over to the next side and repeat
the<00:02:16.870> steps<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.849> usually<00:02:18.849> do<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.720> big<00:02:19.959> sections

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the steps I usually do for big sections

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.350 
the steps I usually do for big sections
but<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.099> do<00:02:21.220> smaller<00:02:21.519> sections<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:22.180> you'd

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
but you can do smaller sections if you'd

00:02:22.360 --> 00:03:18.140 
but you can do smaller sections if you'd
like<00:02:22.680> really<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:24.010> you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:33.470 

I<00:03:31.340> decided<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.549> do<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.939> back<00:03:33.120> section

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
I decided to do the back section

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.020 
I decided to do the back section
off-camera<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:35.040> sure<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.400> guys<00:03:35.459> have<00:03:35.879> it
