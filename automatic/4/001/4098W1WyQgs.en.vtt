 hello to all I want to thank all 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.140
 subscribers today I was talking to you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.480
 fishing for pike that was not going well 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 great that an old watercourse fishing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 pike but not very difficult for 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 lovers of this type of fishing especially 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.309
 the live fishing that I presented to you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
 later to see go into details 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 pike fishing and agrees to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.150
 point out the pike a behavior and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 very particular habits that one does not 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.470
 found only very rarely in others 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.330
 fish does not feed regularly 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.159
 he is not so young and every day he 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.449
 are there every night I have very fast but 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.000
 stay pretty empty stomach 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.790
 I can confirm that, but when 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.589
 his appetite he was plugged he on uche 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.680
 your life in a way never seen in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.940
 the other types of fishing they eat themselves 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.890
 even between them they are the biggest 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.229
 creators of the nanny at the g1 stay 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.930
 once a plug is attacked 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 by a hook of 60 to 70 5 but good 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 that's it for the little story I know 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.969
 you all ask the question to what 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 period fishing pike for me the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.460
 pike not against the year and the period 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.929
 fee is the least favorable but a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.859
 hunting field the most and 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.289
 autumn 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.299
 be why frethun disappears to the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.369
 close to the dread to take in the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.159
 vase and under the banks his quarters 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.829
 from winter to cpl I fish especially in winter 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 and being in winter 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.549
 I have enough bad sin because pike 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 did not grow I move them 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 sometimes the day to feed 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.429
 very big shots now I 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.380
 I'll talk about fishing techniques 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.579
 pike in particular in this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.770
 Jewish fishing video 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.030
 it's a fairly practiced technique of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 nowadays it was simple to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.000
 practice and allow peace of mind 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.270
 specimens the choice of the bright is essential 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.430
 in this type of fishing 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.500
 the bright and as its name indicates the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.220
 living fish how do you tap the task at 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.620
 end of the line 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.350
 but he has good and bad quick and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 mediocre zabeth does not suit them 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.260
 are very fragile and very quickly 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 Paul be screw Gabon is a good live 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 but lazy enough you have to shake them 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.740
 as soon as the float is immobile this 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 keen boy must be used with a 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.570

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.310
