the<00:02:20.420> whole<00:02:20.629> thing<00:02:20.659> to<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.019> Phantom<00:02:21.409> Zone<00:02:23.110> so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the whole thing to the Phantom Zone so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.039 
the whole thing to the Phantom Zone so
fairly<00:02:24.620> he's<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.040> big<00:02:25.280> enough<00:02:25.519> threat<00:02:25.810> hog<00:02:26.810> got

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
fairly he's up big enough threat hog got

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.210 
fairly he's up big enough threat hog got
kind<00:02:27.349> of<00:02:27.409> out<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.560> hand<00:02:27.680> salute

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
kind of out of hand salute

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.030 
kind of out of hand salute
they<00:02:28.400> shot<00:02:28.610> Hulk<00:02:28.909> into<00:02:29.120> space<00:02:30.040> there's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
they shot Hulk into space there's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.679 
they shot Hulk into space there's
similar<00:02:31.400> threat<00:02:31.610> levels<00:02:31.909> we're<00:02:32.510> currently

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
similar threat levels we're currently

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.990 
similar threat levels we're currently
speed<00:02:33.459> course<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.579> doomsday<00:02:35.230> strength<00:02:37.000> you

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
speed course a doomsday strength you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.039 
speed course a doomsday strength you
know<00:02:38.170> at<00:02:39.170> first<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.980> goes<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.400> doomsday

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
know at first this goes to doomsday

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.039 
know at first this goes to doomsday
however<00:02:42.049> as<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.829> fight<00:02:43.069> progresses

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
however as the fight progresses

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.610 
however as the fight progresses
Hulk<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.170> going<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.409> get<00:02:45.530> stronger<00:02:46.390> stronger

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
Hulk is going to get stronger stronger

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.449 
Hulk is going to get stronger stronger
and<00:02:48.620> stronger

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
and stronger

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.970 
and stronger
eventually<00:02:50.450> Hulk<00:02:51.409> will<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.650> able<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.859> have

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
eventually Hulk will be able to have

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.259 
eventually Hulk will be able to have
more<00:02:52.220> strength<00:02:52.430> than<00:02:52.639> doomsday

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
more strength than doomsday

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.180 
more strength than doomsday
I<00:02:53.299> do<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:53.810> believe<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> Hulk<00:02:55.010> has

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
I do not believe in the Hulk has

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.500 
I do not believe in the Hulk has
infinite<00:02:55.819> strength<00:02:57.159> no<00:02:58.159> he<00:02:59.030> does<00:02:59.180> not<00:02:59.329> have

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
infinite strength no he does not have

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.000 
infinite strength no he does not have
infinite<00:02:59.900> strength<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:02.959> Hulk<00:03:03.560> Hulk

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
infinite strength you know Hulk Hulk

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.039 
infinite strength you know Hulk Hulk
will<00:03:04.220> get<00:03:04.370> stronger<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.359> stronger<00:03:05.659> as<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
will get stronger and stronger as the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.420 
will get stronger and stronger as the
fight<00:03:06.230> wears<00:03:06.409> on<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:08.510> about<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:09.310> he's<00:03:10.310> not

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
fight wears on that's about it he's not

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.460 
fight wears on that's about it he's not
going<00:03:10.609> to<00:03:10.730> start<00:03:10.939> out<00:03:11.090> stronger<00:03:11.569> he<00:03:12.319> will

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
going to start out stronger he will

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.800 
going to start out stronger he will
eventually<00:03:12.769> become<00:03:13.250> equal<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.389> slightly

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
eventually become equal to a slightly

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.360 
eventually become equal to a slightly
stronger<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.200> doomsday<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.010> now<00:03:16.099> we're<00:03:16.250> down

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
stronger the doomsday so now we're down

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.270 
stronger the doomsday so now we're down
to<00:03:16.430> durability<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.629> vulnerability

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.800 

durability<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:23.440> has<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.800> go<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.950> doomsday

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
durability that has to go to doomsday

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.559 
durability that has to go to doomsday
the<00:03:25.810> amount<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.110> beating<00:03:26.530> doomsday<00:03:26.980> has<00:03:27.130> taken

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
the amount of beating doomsday has taken

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.100 
the amount of beating doomsday has taken
consistently<00:03:28.950> consistently<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:32.260> impressive

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
consistently consistently is impressive

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.420 
consistently consistently is impressive
now<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.710> come<00:03:34.920> down<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.750> durability<00:03:37.430> one's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
now I come down to durability one's

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.310 
now I come down to durability one's
ability<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.880> come<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.420> from<00:03:39.930> massive

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
amounts of injury at first I think I may

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.470 
amounts of injury at first I think I may
know<00:03:45.570> doomsday<00:03:46.020> has<00:03:46.170> taken<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.910> beating<00:03:47.910> and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
know doomsday has taken a beating and

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.130 
know doomsday has taken a beating and
gotten<00:03:48.900> right<00:03:48.990> back<00:03:49.200> up<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:51.720> wall<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.990> tech

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
gotten right back up that wall to tech

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.130 
gotten right back up that wall to tech
same<00:03:52.320> time<00:03:52.530> though<00:03:53.510> Hulk<00:03:54.510> has<00:03:54.660> got<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.840> healing

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
cut Hulk and come off fairly easily but

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.420 
cut Hulk and come off fairly easily but
I<00:04:04.290> picture<00:04:04.560> health<00:04:04.770> been<00:04:04.890> able<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.160> recover
