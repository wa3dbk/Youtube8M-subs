00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.269
 it's an ideal 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.200
 today we will resume as I told you at once so that 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.579
 the bosses 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:10.700
 to their development 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's simply 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.559
 the round trips that fundamentals 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.689
 sucker the right hand on the bodies you know 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.720
 which is wrong 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.919
 the user to allow play 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.310
 although oriented December 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 see you today and see what he has 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640
 fashion addict 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 most of the time it's like that 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.970
 arrows that tells you if it's a beat by beat table 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.750
 an arrow 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.450
 who is actually 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 this abatement down 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.800
 it seems contradictory corp 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 the show is the sport and more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.400
 why because we do that it means that the fear that we start with the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.140
 pick the express games 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 before this date 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.790
 for how long do you imagine his rivals the arrow because that's 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.700
 things 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 so very hot pick up 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.780
 the arrows at the bottom 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 the cakes down and we go back 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.940
 we have to huddle we must know that we agree 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 still clearly it takes 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080
 if we made a good euro 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.640
 on the one hand because there too we do not know if we make it from there to do 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.910
 the course 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.910
 however the proportion 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.260
 so on the men I have encrusted you 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.770
 in the picture 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 you can notice that he had flexed here are white arrows 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 then the black arrows cards are prisoners 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 the descents that will be played 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.840
 for the white arrow is that it is not played deliberately to smother the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 ropes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
 with the finger this information breaks down 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 I go down means joy I do not play it 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.389
 when I meet 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.049
 always nothing 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.119
 it's a matter of days 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.069
 surely I will play 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.019
 that's me 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.109
 boards 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.049
 if his two black arrows at 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.419
 I am my part a day 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.850
 so the first country I bet go 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.039
 then he had to select 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.749
 that the electric the first shot 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.609
 on which we descend 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.949
 in relief without playing in two years for frozen 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.949
 what is more complex? 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.429
 2nd 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.759
 pickets press all the churches of asia 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.299
 the comedians mix the pace back and forth no criticism ten 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 back and forth said we would not play the win 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.729
 third rhythmic so a rhythmic 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.519
 who blends the shop the first victim agree 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.699
 so you have 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.009
 a black arrow going down 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.559
 richmor going back to the jo 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.879
 and I believe they are 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.099
 fashion victim so we go back very quickly 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.289
 in addition I have to play and condescend 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.109
 I wanted to take my time in December 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.109
 they went back 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.909
 tel number 4 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.489
 and to the descendant for montpellier 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.929
 completed in December 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.399
 greedy and without recourse to the world 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.399
 frankly 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.449
 okay so that's not all 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.239
 that's it for the buildings of grace 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:05.689
 while of honor 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.559
 in e1 small subwoofer members the most famous boats are all 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.139
 the days what I just gave you and the campfire rhythms the bank 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.689
 eric society putout debt you can connect fuller 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.979
 so I'll give you a little example 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.229
 it also helps to learn what a hood is 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.900
 so what is called k potash 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.569
 it's mostly instruments 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.099
 the little hood 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.789
 and we place it on the bodies 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.110
 according to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.110
 the tone suitably find sponsors 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.559
 I will do 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.559
 and so the quality dropped a few hours 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.350
 it's a lot harder the more you go down the sleeve 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.469
 are you surprised 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.509
 two examples 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.259
 to the point that he misses to know them 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 the beat his cell 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.819
 marl 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.930
 on the buildings of 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.610
 he mimed criminal 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.979
 risk 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.949
 so now let's play a song of 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.610
 andrÃ© salvador called 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.270
 luqman tonight manset 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.270
 a song that's pretty simple chord level 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.839
 you will see at the level of the site beats to learn that it is certain 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.379
 e then the attentions 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 sales 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.729
 so the meaning twice 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.729
 turn this soldier 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.889
 for philippe aumont I wanted to play on this occasion 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.809
 it's a box 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:10.789
 you could come to see 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.030
 so well my fingers 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.070
 than 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.729
 top of the league 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.729
 with mickey 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.839
 5 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.779
 happy 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.969
 fairly simple audience 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.389
 ropes flat downhill 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.289
 for montpellier 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.289
 ben wallace actually 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.789
 after 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.710
 Hello 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.759
 the ropes 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.759
 flat all the time whether going up or down 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.039
 by raising the balloon 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.149
 the pursuit 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.259
 when it must be understood that the roof of the building 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:32.089
 it is necessary that 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:34.509
 the boss of the brand from 5 to 2 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.080
 it's a building 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.330
 a bit like a metronome 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.869
 at the base 

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:44.490
 I think you'll do if you go I'm not touching the strings 

00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:45.520
 to touch them 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.699
 it is necessary 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.879
 it is always necessary that it is valid 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.229
 all the songs 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:50.949
 for all tastes
