00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 boys and girls welcome the departure 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 from more to one in the killers and this time 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.090
 I'm here to play the game and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.620
 I hope it was very good you see that I 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.540
 I took with I do not know what to put because 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.719
 it's very simple you basically have to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 skip 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.539
 go go 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.970
 then with this team we can 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.939
 jump so doing the jump and then 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.180
 I like it, but it's not that I usually 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.180
 take 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.700
 and that's it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.650
 we have to recover 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.670
 let's try and let's go 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.670
 do not 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.910
 and let's see 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.220
 you are asking guys who are you is 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.010
 that's why he wants to take off when he 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.869
 I'm going to give you as you can see here I have a 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.009
 installed program of which surely 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.409
 I would review projects that 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.610
 love the truth is very easy to 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.710
 install and good is a way of let's say 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.380
 add more record creatures are macros 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.479
 of terminals or are simply macros 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.450
 to execute commands with this from here you 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.680
 I give gigi it and puts one in command 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.090
 because what you put in is supposed to 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.399
 mind is 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.850
 they are very basic things that really are 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.479
 music that rocks a lot and I think that you 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.340
 I'll do a video like explaining what 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.110
 it's the functioning of everything 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.429
 this ends now that we are here in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.090
 I'll show you the change 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.090
 we are here 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.700
 exhibit it can be prepared for sale 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:09.289
 project at the time then it is quite not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.289
 pretty pretty 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.200
 as well as it was fine and nothing wants 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.030
 explain to the kids tomorrow is the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.980
 oz tournament etc 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.190
 I will leave the link here in the description of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 this video so that you can 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.230
 get in and see the live too 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.120
 respond now for several countries and such 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.010

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.340

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.349

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.620
 I will only put Spain in Mexico, Chile 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.620
 Argentina 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.500
 we already know there are many do not know no 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.730
 have nothing to do either 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.230
 put yourself on a page that changes the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 the schedules and you're 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.230

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.510
