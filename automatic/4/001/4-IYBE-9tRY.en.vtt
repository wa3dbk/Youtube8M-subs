ascend<00:00:03.810> p1<00:00:04.140> LTE<00:00:04.620> here's<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.580> hands-on<00:00:05.970> um<00:00:06.290> now

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
ascend p1 LTE here's the hands-on um now

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.180 
ascend p1 LTE here's the hands-on um now
obviously<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> LT<00:00:08.820> /<00:00:09.240> 4G<00:00:09.929> because<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> name

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
obviously it is LT / 4G because the name

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.310 
obviously it is LT / 4G because the name
implies<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.690> it<00:00:12.690> has<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> bigger<00:00:13.080> battery

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
implies that it has a bigger battery

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.160 
implies that it has a bigger battery
which<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.710> 200<00:00:14.309> milliamps<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.809> pretty

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
which is 200 milliamps which is pretty

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
which is 200 milliamps which is pretty
good<00:00:16.350> actually<00:00:16.740> supposed<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> most<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> time

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060

for<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:56.699> custom<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.199> Hawaii<00:00:58.590> skin

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
for with custom I you know Hawaii skin

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.020 
for with custom I you know Hawaii skin
so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> guess<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.030> okay<00:01:00.420> um<00:01:01.460> now<00:01:02.460> that's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so I guess that's okay um now that's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.429 
so I guess that's okay um now that's
pretty<00:01:03.270> much<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
pretty much it that for that I guess we

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.580 
pretty much it that for that I guess we
won<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> pictures<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.960> overall<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
won the pictures now overall I think it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
won the pictures now overall I think it
actually<00:01:07.710> does<00:01:08.100> look<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> nice<00:01:08.640> phone<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
actually does look like a nice phone it
