00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
compliant with these rules I don't think

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
compliant with these rules I don't think
it's<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> break<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.360 
it's because they want to break the
rules<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.890> might<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.100> some
