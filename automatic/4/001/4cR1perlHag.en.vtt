00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
move the leg but then focused on having

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.469 
move the leg but then focused on having
sticks<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.979> move<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.369> under<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> floor

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
which you did not see thanks to some

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300 
which you did not see thanks to some
movie<00:01:33.420> magic<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.409> show<00:01:34.740> footage<00:01:34.979> of

the<00:01:35.700> neck<00:01:36.210> where<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.200> moved<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> well

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the neck where it moved kind of well

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
the neck where it moved kind of well
really<00:01:38.430> awkwardly<00:01:38.970> cuz<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.329> wanted<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> show

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
really awkwardly cuz I wanted to show

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.880 
really awkwardly cuz I wanted to show
its<00:01:39.840> range<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> motion<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> made<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
its range of motion so it made a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.550 
its range of motion so it made a
complete<00:01:41.340> us<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> left-right<00:01:43.320> up-down

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
complete us with the left-right up-down

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
complete us with the left-right up-down
joints<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.700> being<00:01:44.939> independent<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> could

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
joints all being independent so it could

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
joints all being independent so it could
move<00:01:46.159> crazily<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.369> around<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.909> also

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
move crazily all around there was also

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
move crazily all around there was also
spring-loaded<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> could<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
spring-loaded so that it could have a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
spring-loaded so that it could have a
realistic<00:01:51.240> floating<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.560> doesn't

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
realistic floating thing which doesn't

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.020 
realistic floating thing which doesn't
work<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.159> me<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
work on me because I don't have that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.830 
work on me because I don't have that
kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> neck

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
kind of neck

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
kind of neck
the<00:01:54.990> venom<00:01:55.259> spitting<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> trick<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the venom spitting was not a trick it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060 
the venom spitting was not a trick it
actually<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.869> launch<00:01:58.110> directly<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
mass of the spitter moves left and right

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.190 
mass of the spitter moves left and right
kind<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.579> torques<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.120> puppeteer<00:03:44.750> down<00:03:44.959> below

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
kind of torques the puppeteer down below

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:57.270 
kind of torques the puppeteer down below
a<00:03:45.230> little<00:03:45.410> bit

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.120 
have a question though do you think that
these<00:04:26.539> animatronics<00:04:27.410> that<00:04:27.500> are<00:04:27.830> very

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
these animatronics that are very

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.210 
these animatronics that are very
complicated<00:04:28.639> very<00:04:29.180> complex<00:04:29.750> are<00:04:30.080> superior<00:04:31.039> to

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
complicated very complex are superior to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.550 
complicated very complex are superior to
