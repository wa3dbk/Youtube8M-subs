zipper details on some dresses and I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.160 
zipper details on some dresses and I
thought<00:00:12.059> they<00:00:12.240> were<00:00:12.300> cute<00:00:12.570> but<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.900> didn't

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
thought they were cute but I didn't

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
thought they were cute but I didn't
really<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.410> much<00:00:13.650> more<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:15.150> just

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
really think much more of it but just

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.050 
really think much more of it but just
recently<00:00:15.750> I've<00:00:15.990> seen<00:00:16.440> quite<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.460> bit<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> zipper

know what makes it cute is the the hard
metal<00:01:13.320> edge<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> soft<00:01:14.880> prettiness

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
metal edge and then the soft prettiness

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.499 
metal edge and then the soft prettiness
of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> flower<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.939> zippers<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of the flower so your zippers that you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.620 
of the flower so your zippers that you
get<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:19.100> probably<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> come<00:01:20.549> apart<00:01:23.630> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
get are probably going to come apart and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.940 
get are probably going to come apart and
then<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:25.380> also<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> need<00:01:26.490> just

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
then you're also going to need just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
then you're also going to need just
something<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.159> anchor<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.090> flower<00:01:30.360> -<00:01:30.630> I've

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
something to anchor your flower - I've

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
something to anchor your flower - I've
got<00:01:31.140> felt<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.070> reason<00:01:32.369> I've<00:01:32.490> chosen

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
got felt here the reason I've chosen

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.600 
got felt here the reason I've chosen
felt<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> doesn't<00:01:34.200> fray<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
felt is because it doesn't fray and it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.830 
felt is because it doesn't fray and it
doesn't<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.000> stretch<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:39.180> obviously<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
doesn't really stretch now obviously you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.880 
doesn't really stretch now obviously you
probably<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.880> felt<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.720> fabric<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.770> will

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
probably want felt or a fabric that will

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
probably want felt or a fabric that will
match<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> color<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.090> zipper<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:46.079> they

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
match the color of your zipper but they

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
match the color of your zipper but they
didn't<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.590> black<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.100> only<00:01:47.280> had<00:01:47.460> Browns

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
didn't have black they only had Browns

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.050 
didn't have black they only had Browns
so<00:01:48.119> whatever<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> won't<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so whatever you won't really see it so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.010 
so whatever you won't really see it so
you're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> start<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:51.720> cutting

you're going to start by cutting

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
you're going to start by cutting
yourself<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.430> circle<00:01:56.060> don't<00:01:57.060> worry

then<00:02:12.840> you've<00:02:12.990> got<00:02:13.140> your<00:02:13.260> zipper<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.819> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
then you've got your zipper now this I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.600 
then you've got your zipper now this I
think<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.720> 40<00:02:16.200> centimeter<00:02:16.800> zipper<00:02:17.400> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
think this is a 40 centimeter zipper and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.380 
think this is a 40 centimeter zipper and
it's<00:02:18.450> only<00:02:18.690> half<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.650> open<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
it's only half of it like it's open and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.910 
it's only half of it like it's open and
what<00:02:21.390> I'm<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.750> do<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.680> cut

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.820 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
off<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.910> end<00:02:24.020> because<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> bit

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
off this end because it's just got a bit

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460 
off this end because it's just got a bit
of<00:02:25.920> hard<00:02:26.130> plastic<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.880> then<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.470> metal

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
of hard plastic and then this some metal

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.690 
of hard plastic and then this some metal
thing<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.550> way

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
thing it's just going to be in the way

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.320 
thing it's just going to be in the way
so<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> cut<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.110> off<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:35.330> then

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
so I'm going to cut that off and then

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.180 
so I'm going to cut that off and then
I'm<00:02:36.630> gonna<00:02:38.989> lose<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.230> zipper<00:02:40.530> part<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.010> don't

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
I'm gonna lose the zipper part you don't

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.160 
I'm gonna lose the zipper part you don't
need<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.550> oh<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.390> could<00:02:42.660> leave<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:42.989> if

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
need that oh you could leave it on if

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
need that oh you could leave it on if
you<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:43.560> really<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.980> don't<00:02:44.160> want<00:02:44.310> it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
you want but really you don't want it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.470 
you want but really you don't want it
okay<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> first<00:02:46.739> step<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.700> take<00:02:48.269> your

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
okay then the first step is to take your

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.440 
okay then the first step is to take your
needle<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.810> thread<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:50.120> you're<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.269> going

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
needle and thread and you're just going

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.920 
needle and thread and you're just going
to<00:02:51.480> anchor<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.470> zipper<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.580> felt

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.030 

once<00:02:58.930> you're<00:02:59.080> confident<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.590> it's<00:02:59.830> going<00:02:59.950> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
once you're confident that it's going to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.570 
once you're confident that it's going to
stay<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.370> place<00:03:00.520> that'll<00:03:01.120> be<00:03:01.210> enough<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:03.310> at

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
stay in place that'll be enough now at

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.890 
stay in place that'll be enough now at
this<00:03:03.760> point<00:03:04.120> you're<00:03:04.300> probably<00:03:04.330> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.780> want

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
this point you're probably going to want

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.350 
this point you're probably going to want
to<00:03:05.050> play<00:03:05.260> around<00:03:05.530> without<00:03:05.800> sewing<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.670> just<00:03:07.210> to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
to play around without sewing it just to

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.210 
to play around without sewing it just to
see<00:03:07.540> how<00:03:07.810> many<00:03:08.020> petals<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.500> can<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.830> how<00:03:09.010> big

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
see how many petals you can have how big

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.440 
see how many petals you can have how big
you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.490> make<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.760> petals<00:03:10.090> make<00:03:10.270> sure

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450

flour like such now you're just going to

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:41.659

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.459 
Kait once you feel it's anchored in
place<00:05:44.129> good<00:05:44.550> enough<00:05:44.659> just<00:05:45.659> do<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.080> couple<00:05:46.409> of

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
place good enough just do a couple of

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.279 
place good enough just do a couple of
stitches<00:05:46.909> to<00:05:47.909> finish<00:05:48.539> it<00:05:48.659> off<00:05:48.749> so<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:49.020> doesn't

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
stitches to finish it off so it doesn't

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.929 
stitches to finish it off so it doesn't
come<00:05:49.439> undone<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:51.199> that's<00:05:52.199> basically<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.890

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.480 
you can see that but all the stitches
are<00:06:02.249> concentrated<00:06:02.969> in<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.240> same<00:06:03.479> area<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:04.490> you
