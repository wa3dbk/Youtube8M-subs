well<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.710> answer<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.760> we<00:01:43.510> have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
well the answer is is we have

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.600 
well the answer is is we have
participants<00:01:44.470> from<00:01:44.740> all<00:01:45.070> over<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.580> world

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
that are helping us look for a Bigfoot

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.790 
that are helping us look for a Bigfoot
so<00:01:48.550> we<00:01:49.360> when<00:01:49.690> we<00:01:49.720> hear<00:01:50.140> something<00:01:50.410> in<00:01:50.680> the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
so we when we hear something in the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.310 
so we when we hear something in the
bushes<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.550> turn<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.970> cameras<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.840> it's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
bushes we turn the cameras on and it's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.480 
bushes we turn the cameras on and it's
up<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.770> guys<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:54.070> help<00:01:54.490> find<00:01:54.880> them<00:01:56.490> now

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
up to you guys to help find them now

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.420 
up to you guys to help find them now
this<00:01:57.730> has<00:01:57.940> worked<00:01:58.180> out<00:01:58.480> very<00:01:58.510> well<00:01:59.100> very<00:02:00.100> many

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
this has worked out very well very many

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.660 
this has worked out very well very many
faces<00:02:01.060> have<00:02:01.270> been<00:02:01.300> located<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.440> we<00:02:03.130> put<00:02:03.460> them

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
faces have been located and we put them

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.450 
faces have been located and we put them
in<00:02:03.850> our<00:02:03.970> Bigfoot<00:02:04.240> face<00:02:04.810> database<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.680> again

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
in our Bigfoot face database and again

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.520 
in our Bigfoot face database and again
we<00:02:06.850> don't<00:02:06.970> care<00:02:07.330> if<00:02:07.510> there's<00:02:07.780> Squatch<00:02:08.140> blogs

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
we don't care if there's Squatch blogs

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.730 
we don't care if there's Squatch blogs
or<00:02:08.920> blurry<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.640> whatever<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:11.200> goes<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
or blurry or whatever it goes in the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.540 
or blurry or whatever it goes in the
database<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:12.850> we<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.360> look<00:02:13.570> for<00:02:13.870> for

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
database so that we can look for for

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.280 
database so that we can look for for
matching<00:02:15.550> faces<00:02:16.180> from<00:02:16.450> different<00:02:16.840> times<00:02:17.050> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
matching faces from different times in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.590 
matching faces from different times in
different<00:02:17.350> places<00:02:17.890> because<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.570> only

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
different places because that's the only

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.500 
different places because that's the only
way<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.950> eliminate<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
way you're going to eliminate the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.580 
way you're going to eliminate the
optical<00:02:23.110> illusions<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> face<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
optical illusions if you see a face and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.130 
optical illusions if you see a face and
you<00:02:26.740> want<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.250> include<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.480> our<00:02:28.600> database

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you want to include that in our database

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.300 
you want to include that in our database
take<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> freeze<00:02:30.280> frame<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.680> jpg

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.620 
hike to go we didn't carry in the
monopod<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.830> we<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.610> actually<00:03:25.090> see<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
monopod and we can actually see the

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.610 
monopod and we can actually see the
difference<00:03:26.080> in<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.470> shakiness<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.760> film

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.890 
difference in the shakiness of the film
will<00:03:29.620> make<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.040> point<00:03:30.070> next<00:03:30.730> time<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.180> carry

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
will make it a point next time to carry

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.130 
will make it a point next time to carry
the<00:03:32.110> monopod<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.890> that's<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.940> video<00:03:34.780> will<00:03:34.959> be

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the monopod so that's the video will be

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.900 
the monopod so that's the video will be
more<00:03:35.410> stable

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
more stable

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.310
