00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.740 
pivot here so I moved the blade about 22
degrees<00:00:28.650> either<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:32.390> I'm<00:00:33.390> gonna<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.770 
degrees either way I'm gonna have to
make<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> pivot<00:00:34.850> right<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.570> am<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
make it pivot right out here what am I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.470 
make it pivot right out here what am I
end<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:36.960> having<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> may<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
end up having to do is it may have to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
cut these corners off a little bit but
out<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:45.620> I'm<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.280> pivot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
out in here I'm gonna need it to pivot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.229 
out in here I'm gonna need it to pivot
so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.570> lift<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.879> then<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.059> still

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
so I can lift it up and then it's still

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.740 
so I can lift it up and then it's still
going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> pivot<00:00:52.430> down<00:00:53.430> there

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
going to have to pivot down there

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.639 
going to have to pivot down there
wherever<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> mounts<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> role

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
apart at some point in time actually i

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
apart at some point in time actually i
could<00:01:24.150> probably<00:01:24.180> use<00:01:26.270> maybe<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.509> those<00:01:28.460> got

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
could probably use maybe use those got

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
could probably use maybe use those got
another<00:01:29.700> chunk<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:30.090> rod<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.340> i'll

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
another chunk of rod there and i'll

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.690 
another chunk of rod there and i'll
stick<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> main<00:01:33.060> plan<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:34.700> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
stick with the main plan and that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
stick with the main plan and that
axelrod<00:01:36.360> happens<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> fit<00:01:37.020> perfectly<00:01:37.530> into

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
axelrod happens to fit perfectly into

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
axelrod happens to fit perfectly into
this<00:01:38.009> half<00:01:38.490> inch<00:01:38.729> black<00:01:39.360> steel<00:01:39.659> pipe<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:42.259> not

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
this half inch black steel pipe or not

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.990 
this half inch black steel pipe or not
maybe<00:01:43.440> that's<00:01:43.649> three<00:01:43.830> quarter<00:01:44.130> inch<00:01:44.420> anyhow

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
maybe that's three quarter inch anyhow

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.900 
maybe that's three quarter inch anyhow
why<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> went<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.720> double<00:01:49.470> pin<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
why did is I went with double pin on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:58.310 
why did is I went with double pin on
grade<00:01:50.910> eight<00:01:51.090> bolts<00:01:53.450> get<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.810> there

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
what I'll end up doing put up for the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.670 
what I'll end up doing put up for the
pivot<00:02:01.440> part<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:03.450> boat<00:02:03.720> will<00:02:04.020> remain<00:02:04.470> in

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
pivot part is this boat will remain in

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.710 
pivot part is this boat will remain in
this<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.190> will<00:02:05.280> pull<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.510> going<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
this one will pull out I'm not going to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.570 
this one will pull out I'm not going to
worry<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.380> swing<00:02:07.650> part<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.280> point

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
worry about the swing part at this point

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.740 
worry about the swing part at this point
in<00:02:08.670> time<00:02:08.899> but<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.200> did<00:02:10.410> make<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:11.580> tube<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.600> all

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
in time but I did make this tube go all

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.790 
in time but I did make this tube go all
the<00:02:12.900> way<00:02:12.930> through<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.290> back<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.500> here

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the way through so that back in here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.430 
the way through so that back in here

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
like my angle app I'll drill so I'm drop

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.920 
like my angle app I'll drill so I'm drop
a<00:02:24.330> pin<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> same<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> swing

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
a pin in and do the same for the swing

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.140 
a pin in and do the same for the swing
on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> other<00:02:28.290> side<00:02:28.560> drill<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.820> I'm<00:02:29.910> drop<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
on the other side drill so I'm drop a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.580 
on the other side drill so I'm drop a
pin<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:31.520> what<00:02:32.520> I'm<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.590> cut

pivot point got them all clamped on with

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.430 
pivot point got them all clamped on with
step<00:04:11.840> over<00:04:12.320> where<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.800> them<00:04:13.209> got<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.440> primer
