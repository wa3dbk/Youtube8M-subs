00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.200
 new home win for Real Madrid two weeks ago was in 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.210
 mestalla this day the pizjuán was the place where whites thrashed and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.589
 they were far superior to the local set 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.199
 two to six for the team of mourinho that accumulates five consecutive games 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.230
 away from home winning 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.480
 Real Madrid came out with black bracelets as a sign of mourning for the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.060
 Death of Severian Crossbowmen 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.759
 from almost the first minute it was the intention of the whites that in the eight 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.070
 they were about to inaugurate the marker by means of benzema after a 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:31.949
 go to the tasting hole 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.730
 was the one who managed to put the 0 1 he did not like to head this corner 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.120
 launched by ozil ended on the net from barak thanks to the header of the beds 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.839
 it was his fourth goal of the season and as the rest he scored with a shot from 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:46.930
 head 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.010
 only three minutes later it was seen that nobody was satisfied ronaldo Christian in 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.270
 full fight for the top scorer made it clear his intentions crashed this ball in 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.230
 the stick after another corner 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.910
 it was only a test because afterwards he would score four times the first in the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.270
 minute 30 marcelo takes a foul the throws back of head pp and Christian with the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.690
 foot 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 with him but all 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.730
 from the center of the area 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.040
 he put the best thing for Real Madrid and before reaching the break 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.340
 would score a third goal through kaká the '8' Real Madrid received a good 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.230
 pass list and we said end from the front of the area as we have seen 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.700
 mark many times 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.689
 the Brazilian placed Real Madrid 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.689
 with zero to three and 45 minutes ahead 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.220
 He came out with Estevill impetus trying to burn all the ships he had left 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 but the real Madrid very concentrated explained that the distance will be cut 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 only negredo in the 60th minute and a whip from outside the area 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 could it reached three on the scoreboard 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.020
 but nervous hopes are over soon because five minutes later 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.290
 would begin the recital of goals of Christian ronaldo in 65 'very attentive 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.850
 took advantage of a monumental failure of the sevillista defense to sentence the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.750
 match a horizontal pass on the edge of the area intercepted the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 Portuguese and shot mercilessly 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.720
 in four minutes I would take a good ozil pass 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.590
 with speed they provoked hand to hand with stick in which again it came out 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.480
 victorious was his third goal and in one to five for the whites 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.130
 and in the sixth again citigate magic you pass on long 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.799
 ran benzema for a ball that went outside 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.599
 step back I made recent was in charge of dialing 1 to 6 for Madrid was his 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.189
 fourth goal the second time he scored a poker in the league before he did against 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.069
 the racing 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.279
 Cristiano Ronaldo has already scored 33 league goals and is a top scorer 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:40.699
 little matter since negredo made up the result in '83 of a header on the 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.929
 Real Madrid scored in a very complicated field and added 12 goals in the 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.429
 last two away games
