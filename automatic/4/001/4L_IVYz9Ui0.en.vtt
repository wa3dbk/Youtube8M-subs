00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.750 

this<00:00:01.110> week<00:00:01.500> instead<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.040> upgrading<00:00:02.730> my

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this week instead of upgrading my

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.789 
this week instead of upgrading my
throwing<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.510> decided<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.140> boost<00:00:04.410> up<00:00:04.620> the

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
throwing I decided to boost up the

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.970 
throwing I decided to boost up the
consistency<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.029> way<00:00:06.870> I'll<00:00:07.020> get<00:00:07.200> more<00:00:07.500> XP

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
consistency that way I'll get more XP

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.419 
consistency that way I'll get more XP
after<00:00:08.700> each<00:00:08.940> game<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.929> between<00:00:10.530> doing<00:00:10.889> drills

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
after each game in between doing drills

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.919 
after each game in between doing drills
I<00:00:12.049> typically<00:00:13.049> get<00:00:13.380> around<00:00:13.799> 600<00:00:14.580> or<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.969> XP<00:00:15.630> per

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
I typically get around 600 or so XP per

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.290 
I typically get around 600 or so XP per
drill<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> then<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> shorter<00:00:17.670> drills<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.119> get

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
drill and then the shorter drills I get

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.439 
drill and then the shorter drills I get
between<00:00:18.539> 260<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.560> 280<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.760> hopefully<00:00:21.270> those

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
between 260 to 280 so hopefully those

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.750 
between 260 to 280 so hopefully those
numbers<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.529> bit<00:00:22.560> after<00:00:22.949> upgrading<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
numbers go up a bit after upgrading and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.939 
numbers go up a bit after upgrading and

my favorite play ten zero you got to do
that<00:02:18.150> when<00:02:18.299> your<00:02:18.420> defense<00:02:18.840> comes<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.319> and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that when your defense comes out and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.650 
that when your defense comes out and
gets<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.829> spot<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.390> come

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
gets a spot like that you got to come

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.880 
gets a spot like that you got to come
down<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.049> field<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.860> score<00:02:24.890> Manning
