the curls so as you can see I pulled it
down<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.430> case<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.449> guys

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
down just a little bit in case you guys

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
down just a little bit in case you guys
would<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> style<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.969> let's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
would like to style it as so so let's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
would like to style it as so so let's
roll<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:00.750> pictures<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
roll some pictures and see what that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:14.120 
roll some pictures and see what that

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.290 

so<00:01:15.130> what<00:01:15.280> if<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.520> first<00:01:15.730> option<00:01:16.090> wasn't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
so what if the first option wasn't

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.410 
so what if the first option wasn't
enough<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:17.260> can<00:01:17.530> actually<00:01:17.800> pull<00:01:18.400> it<00:01:18.550> out<00:01:18.670> even

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420
