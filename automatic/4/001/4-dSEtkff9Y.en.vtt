00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.810
 and good friends we had 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.880
 we leave 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 the truth that this year I was not going to plant 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.680
 but the truth that has convinced me 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.680
 look this year 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.059
 I have planted a pear tree 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.550
 this is the variety he has here 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.330
 but neither harding 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 whatever 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.050
 the strawberry is blooming here 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 you have to be healthy 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 the most beautiful flowers 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.560
 good time you know here 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.680
 Water soaks the table will not stop here 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.680
 to rain 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.129
 I teach them to improve 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.519
 this year we sowed a lot 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.460
 but some 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 this is a kind of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.580
 these are beans but they are brown 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.130
 and handling so many 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.140
 here we have brown for the lord to 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 zucchini but much bigger 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.300
 squash that looks like it's sprouting 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.180
 as well 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.340
 yes i ran 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.780
 similar to lettuce but let's say more 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.780
 compact because it is not part 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.650
 different reality of lettuce 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.720
 spinach 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.770
 heart of ox that is already 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 blunting also 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 the theme of my level 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.930
 you are also disputing here a little 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.610
 little bit 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.550
 the truth that with this time I can not 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.290
 ask a lot 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.360
 this from here on the pilgrim pumpkin 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.120
 where you always win you know that the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.220
 seeds are sprouting despite 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 mark 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.840
 Right now we want those who wait 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.890
 tura 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.959
 20 degrees and a humidity of 60 so 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.910
 it is well the truth that here in the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.350
 greenhouse is well preserved 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.940
 temperature 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.310
 and now solid sun 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.640
 so you have to take advantage 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.190
 here on this side I have planted the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 elephants you know how low these 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.450
 great giants 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.829
 to see how they are going this year out this 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.060
 once not seeded within 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.420
 greenhouses 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.319
 Now that I have some onions 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.319
 and chive 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.300
 over here you can see how I prepared the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.300
 the orchard 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.120
 all the earth is already removed 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.250
 and here I had here I had nothing chickens 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.490
 about one month 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.050
 with which they were digging and fertilizing 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.830
 at the same time 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.080
 note that everything is covered in this 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.900
 kind of plastic is not practical is 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.290
 transferable this what makes it hold 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.299
 more humidity 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.299
 and prevents weeds from coming out 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.060
 my friend sings to them unemployment that scares little 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.800
 but good 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.800
 little by little making you compete 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.720
 in this bank here I have 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.590
 seeded 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.590
 pea 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 here I have bean 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.390
 now a lot of honey and fresh water 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.210
 all 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.160
 and in this bank here is female 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.160
 potato three varieties of potato 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.160
 here you can see 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.350
 you are blunting some 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.160
 the truth that this year will be later 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.179
 but hey it's late that never 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.490
 the only thing that I hope the time I 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.990
 accompany 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.990
 if you get a good harvest 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.419
 and with patience 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.419
 it's taken out sure we're going to 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.419
 I go to the middle 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.789
 and the other one that is expensive 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.460
 this basket is being put is being 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.880
 getting in 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.820
 all this bancal here 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.340
 OK 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.240
 of flowers I have already raised several 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.780
 burgos tulips among other things 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.780
 swift 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.310
 and some seeds that is already starting 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.580
 to rain 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.180
 condition and well been the typical ones of 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.180
 here from england 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.180
 and nothing more the truth that until not 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.960
 transparent so it does not 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.969
 transplants I can not add much 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.150
 so 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:49.040
 that soon I will make a new video 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.200
 when you are a little more advanced 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.520
 themes 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.940
 it's pink leads pulling up 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.940
 as well 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.670
 I'm full he planted my sister 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.870
 meritorious 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.870
 to call them to data 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.230
 yes 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.360
 Well, a very big greeting 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.320
 and since it encouraged me then I'll start another 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.940
 time 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.580
 in agreement 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.180
 acute revenge very big and until the 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.180
 next video
