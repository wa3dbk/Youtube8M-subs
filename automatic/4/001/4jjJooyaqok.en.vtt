 tricks and different tricks to 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.300
 ideal to apply rouge to begin with 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.930
 let's talk about what is applied 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.610
 rouge 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 I personally think the majority 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.789
 professionals and for gestures 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 holds the same opinion as the Armenians 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.400
 and should refresh your face not coloring 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.309
 does not select not so much shape the form 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.680
 Tomsk and cheeks namely, let's face 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 fresh healthy look and when we put 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 tonal tool all face is obtained 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.329
 one tone and sometimes it looks pale 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
 that is, it is a few days 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 naturally organism and add in life 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 to face 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 so many are asking where do 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 need to apply blush 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 as you know it used to exist 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.690
 opinion that you need to smile and put 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.360
 the novel is apples cheeks but how do we all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.600
 told ingenious and very attentive 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.490
 and makeup artist my nose british channel 8 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 dig it getting very low that is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 we make sad so it turns out that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.349
 The blush we rush on is practically 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.810
 the level of the tip of the nose may otherwise it 

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:23.399
 quite low and natural ruble here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 never at all usually he was 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.590
 much higher and so is my personal advice 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.050
 exactly to the level 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.170
 dimples apply correction tool then 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.850
 there is darker powder darker 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.189
 she's a foundation or some 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 sculptor and already up on the penumbra 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.090
 the protruding part of this one 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.090
 volume apply blush that is here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.940
 consider our skoda the most bulging 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.159
 part we slightly paint over our on 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.039
 ruddy and another amazing moment i 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.140
 noticed shocking for many years what 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.570
 problems with applying blush udan in general 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.340
 there was no but for some reason the last few 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 years regularly 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.800
 many have a problem like that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.100
 that blush news is stained and I'll tell you 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 why is it because fashion came in here 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.650
 such here bibi cream and that is loose 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.850
 means toning wetter doctrine 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.610
 European production 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.620
 not to be confused with Asian and such 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.739
 stretches to the match before that means 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 which is like a moisturizer 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.730
 mixed with tonal cream they have very 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.420
 little pigment and due to this they are easy 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.630
 apply 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.870
 so that they will not be for the guys that is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.500
 take the funds and distribute applied 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 they are usually with their hands and here in this 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.720
 position looks like everyone 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.680
 perfect and stripes kind will be the most 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.630
 tonal tool 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.090
 and most girls are such flowers 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.769
 Russian bibi cream was encouraged and applied 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.100
 just fingers and what we get 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.570
 when dry 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.980
 tonal tool turns out that the Armenian 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.290
 emphasize if there were irregularities somewhere 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.910
 you are now on hand 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 on 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.220
 after this bibi cream and not very 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.610
 clearly not very smooth to me very homogeneous 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.450
 with such specks 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.600
 irregularities 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.910
 It turned out to cause blush although the problem 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.190
 not exactly tassels tassels bad but 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.650
 statistics, our girls spend less 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.990
 time to apply bibi cream about what 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.330
 applying the usual base just because 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.910
 that some flaws are not so noticeable 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.790
 so girls often we are just bad at 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.980
 that sho you do not really distribute on the skin 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.210
 pay attention to this and the second point 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.470
 many girls do not fix their 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.070
 cream liquid such tonal tool 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.060
 powder what happens if not very 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.550
 flat surface 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.670
 powder it will become a little more 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.190
 smooth and then on top of not sticky 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.200
 non sticky surface these blush will 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.260
 put and much better therefore 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.600
 try either to powder the skin 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.550
 very lightly at least some kind of brush 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.590
 for powder and then apply blush 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.260
 brushes should be softer than 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.910
 so much the better because when they won't 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.890
 move your 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.130
 tonal foundation and powder which 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.709
 laid down and we are very good and without 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 five applied here such here a double brush 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.300
 with double bristles in such a case 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.110
 it turns out its weightless and third type 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.270
 tassels 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.790
 again regardless of brand this 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.720
 synthetic kabuki from micro 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.840
 enzyme 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 windows or any strong and technics or 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.530
 season 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.479
 if and with mineral makeup that we 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.490
 do with such brushes so that well 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.630
 Ideally I stubble it in this case, 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.820
 you need very few Armenians and be photoshop 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.210
 This is how it turns out very 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.850
 natural effect and not stained now 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.150
 you will have to inflict more but will 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.270
 it was exactly in that direction that he was moving 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.039
 such 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.020
 either here is such a brush is obtained 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.289
 very very very good even 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.110
 the results so the moment I 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.720
 for pocket more recommend or yours 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.300

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.870
 serve 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.849
