00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.539 
what the problem is is take an x-ray
okay<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.120> looking<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.600> um<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
okay so what I'm looking at um it's the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
okay so what I'm looking at um it's the
two<00:01:05.880> views<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.240> took<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> hock<00:01:07.170> area<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
two views we took a hock area on this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
two views we took a hock area on this
well<00:01:08.430> particularly<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.090> am<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.960> what's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
well particularly I am I think what's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
well particularly I am I think what's
happened<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> he's<00:01:10.680> broken<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.250> Tarsus<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
happened is he's broken that Tarsus and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
happened is he's broken that Tarsus and
exactly<00:01:12.090> how<00:01:12.240> he<00:01:12.299> did<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.869> I'll

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
exactly how he did that and I'll

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.210 
exactly how he did that and I'll
probably<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.290> stepped<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> by<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
probably got stepped on by one of the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.469 
probably got stepped on by one of the
adults<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:15.000> guest

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
adults would be my guest

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
adults would be my guest
the<00:01:15.869> break<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.710> severe<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.640> may<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:17.970> unable

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the break is so severe he may be unable

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.770 
the break is so severe he may be unable
to<00:01:18.420> walk<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.110> face<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> lifetime<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.460> painful

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
to walk or face a lifetime of painful

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.450 
to walk or face a lifetime of painful
arthritis

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.219 

then<00:01:25.180> we're<00:01:25.390> sort<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.630> down<00:01:25.750> -<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.110> are<00:01:26.200> we

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
then we're sort of down - what are we

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.190 
then we're sort of down - what are we
gonna<00:01:26.320> do<00:01:26.530> with<00:01:26.680> him<00:01:26.860> um<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.970> Thomas<00:01:28.960> point

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
gonna do with him um a Thomas point

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.390 
gonna do with him um a Thomas point
probably<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.740> way<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.860> go<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.130> try<00:01:30.220> to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
probably the way to go to try to

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.280 
probably the way to go to try to
stabilize<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.119> for<00:01:31.420> him<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.810> is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
stabilize that for him it is

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.899 
stabilize that for him it is
disappointing<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.159> know<00:01:33.280> as<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.520> break<00:01:33.729> is

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
disappointing to know as the break is

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.020 
disappointing to know as the break is
pretty<00:01:34.150> serious<00:01:34.750> as<00:01:35.530> my<00:01:35.860> lambs<00:01:36.100> go<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.760> was

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
pretty serious as my lambs go this was

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.690 
pretty serious as my lambs go this was
one<00:01:37.300> of<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.540> nicer<00:01:37.990> looking<00:01:38.350> lambs<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.400> yeah

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
I'm not too happy about it so animal he

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.969 
I'm not too happy about it so animal he
will<00:01:43.030> not<00:01:43.180> be<00:01:43.360> any<00:01:43.479> more<00:01:43.690> market<00:01:44.229> animal<00:01:44.619> yes

will not be any more market animal yes

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.450 
will not be any more market animal yes
market<00:01:45.909> lamb<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:47.020> what<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.470> hope<00:01:47.890> for<00:01:48.280> him

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
market lamb is not what I hope for him

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.109 
market lamb is not what I hope for him
but<00:01:48.729> that's<00:01:48.909> not<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> complete<00:01:50.110> loss<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:51.119> guess

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
but that's not a complete loss I guess

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.010 
but that's not a complete loss I guess
we<00:01:52.390> better<00:01:52.600> try<00:01:54.810> basically<00:01:55.810> what<00:01:55.930> we're

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
we better try basically what we're

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.450 
we better try basically what we're
trying<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.290> do<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.560> make<00:01:56.740> him<00:01:56.890> comfortable

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
trying to do is make him comfortable

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.999 
trying to do is make him comfortable
allow<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.240> bone<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.229> time<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.560> heal

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
allow that bone to have time to heal

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.460 
allow that bone to have time to heal

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
hopefully retaining as much movement in

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.990 
hopefully retaining as much movement in
the<00:02:03.160> joint<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.610> possible<00:02:04.179> alright<00:02:05.670> dr.<00:02:06.670> Brenda
