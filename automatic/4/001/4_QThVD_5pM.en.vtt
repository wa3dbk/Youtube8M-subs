00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
we're so confused I was in charge we're

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.320 
we're so confused I was in charge we're
not<00:03:17.409> used<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.280> house

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.220 

what<00:03:24.010> variety<00:03:25.010> was<00:03:25.160> really<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:26.240> think<00:03:26.540> probably

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
what variety was really I think probably

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.740 
what variety was really I think probably
at<00:03:27.320> its<00:03:27.470> height<00:03:27.770> in<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> early<00:03:28.700> 60s<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.630> this

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
at its height in the early 60s so this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.450 
at its height in the early 60s so this
was<00:03:29.930> our<00:03:30.050> chance<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.440> actually<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.070> variety

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
was our chance to actually do a variety

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.540 
was our chance to actually do a variety
show<00:03:31.490> without<00:03:31.790> actually<00:03:32.210> doing<00:03:32.360> one<00:03:32.690> and

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
show without actually doing one and

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.350 
show without actually doing one and
that's<00:03:34.550> why<00:03:34.790> variety<00:03:35.390> will<00:03:35.600> never<00:03:36.020> die
