which<00:00:13.860> obviously<00:00:14.460> both<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.849> machines<00:00:15.000> are

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
which obviously both these machines are

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.140 
which obviously both these machines are
13<00:00:15.599> inch<00:00:15.719> screens<00:00:16.070> now<00:00:17.070> at<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.119> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
making that video the specs were a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.529 
making that video the specs were a
little<00:00:20.670> different<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> white<00:00:21.300> MacBook

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
little different on the white MacBook

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
gonna do a comparison updating that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
gonna do a comparison updating that
comparison<00:00:26.250> basically<00:00:26.760> between<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.449> two

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
comparison basically between these two

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
comparison basically between these two
machines<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.650> write<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.500> say<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.040> the

now<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.610> much<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:56.909> durable<00:01:57.719> than<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.619> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
now is much more durable than the one I

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
now is much more durable than the one I

made previously because the one

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.170 
made previously because the one

previously spray prone to cracking you'd

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
previously spray prone to cracking you'd
be<00:02:03.270> holding<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.049> one<00:02:04.979> hand<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
be holding that like this one hand you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800 
be holding that like this one hand you
kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> feel<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> bend<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
kind of feel a bend down a little but it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770 
kind of feel a bend down a little but it
has<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.320> rigid<00:02:07.890> block<00:02:08.099> makes<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.060> much<00:02:09.599> more

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
has one rigid block makes it much more

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.140 
has one rigid block makes it much more
durable<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:10.979> gonna<00:02:11.099> last<00:02:11.310> longer<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
durable so it's gonna last longer the

durable so it's gonna last longer the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
displays now are exactly the same but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
displays now are exactly the same but
or<00:02:13.950> they<00:02:14.070> weren't<00:02:14.310> displays<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> viewing<00:02:15.420> angle

or they weren't displays a viewing angle

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.150 
or they weren't displays a viewing angle
is<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.990> same<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.410> they're<00:02:16.530> quite<00:02:16.620> decent

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160

falls<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.720> fact<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.890> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980

they<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.530> added<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.830> couple<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> features<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
they have added a couple of features so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.100 
they have added a couple of features so
surprise<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.240> fact<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> MacBook<00:02:45.960> now

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
surprise the fact that the MacBook now

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.080 
surprise the fact that the MacBook now
has<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.410> trackpad<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.430> great<00:02:47.670> thing<00:02:47.880> which

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
has the trackpad and a great thing which

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.580 
has the trackpad and a great thing which
is<00:02:48.210> probably<00:02:48.570> even<00:02:48.720> further<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> fact

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
is probably even further is the fact

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.080 
is probably even further is the fact

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
this thing is fantastic for batteries so

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.240 
this thing is fantastic for batteries so
I<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.510> definitely<00:03:24.660> say<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.650> MacBook<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I can definitely say the MacBook is the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.780 
I can definitely say the MacBook is the
same<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.940> get<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> lot<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:29.010> know<00:03:29.040> worked<00:03:29.550> on

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
same you get a lot of you know worked on

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.370 
same you get a lot of you know worked on
that<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.690> won't<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.900> charging<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.260> too

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
that and you won't be charging it too

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.670 
that and you won't be charging it too
often<00:03:32.870> almost<00:03:33.870> everything<00:03:34.290> else<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.560> same

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
often almost everything else is the same

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
the new MacBook is a little bit lighter
they're<00:03:37.650> basically<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.370> same<00:03:38.610> machine<00:03:39.170> but

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
they're basically the same machine but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
they're basically the same machine but
this<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.769> little<00:03:41.190> bit<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.400> scalable<00:03:41.880> in

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
this is a little bit more scalable in

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.880 
this is a little bit more scalable in
terms<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.330> fact<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:43.350> know<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.500> can

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
terms of the fact that you know you can

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.670 
terms of the fact that you know you can
go<00:03:44.640> up<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.850> 2.5<00:03:45.570> three<00:03:45.900> gigahertz<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
go up to 2.5 three gigahertz with this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.050 
go up to 2.5 three gigahertz with this
thing<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.340> obviously<00:03:47.489> upgrade<00:03:47.910> this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
thing and you can obviously upgrade this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.280 
thing and you can obviously upgrade this
particular<00:03:48.540> model<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:49.050> there's<00:03:49.230> a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
particular model because there's a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.110 
particular model because there's a
sentence<00:03:49.680> knowing<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.280> could<00:03:50.489> buy<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
sentence knowing that you could buy a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.560 
sentence knowing that you could buy a
slightly<00:03:51.630> higher<00:03:51.870> 13-inch<00:03:52.440> model<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:54.209> also

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
slightly higher 13-inch model and also

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.970 
slightly higher 13-inch model and also
this<00:03:54.989> will<00:03:55.170> go<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> eight<00:03:55.560> gigs<00:03:55.830> around

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
this will go to eight gigs around

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.000 
this will go to eight gigs around
whereas<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> MacBook<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.680> way<00:03:58.800> Mac

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
whereas the MacBook is is the way Mac

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.479 
whereas the MacBook is is the way Mac
will<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.250> stuck<00:03:59.519> on<00:03:59.670> four<00:04:00.269> gigs<00:04:00.540> around<00:04:01.220> all<00:04:02.220> in

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
will be stuck on four gigs around all in

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.460 
will be stuck on four gigs around all in
all<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.209> new<00:04:03.420> white<00:04:03.630> MacBook<00:04:03.900> for

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
all I think the new white MacBook for

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.970 
all I think the new white MacBook for
undergrad<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.760> fantastic<00:04:06.739> choice<00:04:07.739> for

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
undergrad is a fantastic choice for

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.680 
undergrad is a fantastic choice for
other<00:04:08.100> people<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:08.640> anybody's<00:04:09.090> doing<00:04:09.239> editing

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
other people but anybody's doing editing

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.509 
other people but anybody's doing editing
and<00:04:09.810> needs<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.260> an<00:04:10.410> external<00:04:10.799> hard<00:04:10.950> drive<00:04:11.220> or

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
and needs like an external hard drive or

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.190 
and needs like an external hard drive or
other<00:04:11.970> devices<00:04:12.299> or<00:04:12.540> camera<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:12.989> something

other devices or camera or something

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.990 
other devices or camera or something
that's<00:04:13.500> specifically<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.519> your<00:04:14.640> phone<00:04:14.820> all

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
that's specifically on your phone all

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.090 
that's specifically on your phone all
right<00:04:15.030> 800<00:04:15.900> or<00:04:15.989> 400<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.830> done<00:04:16.950> go

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
right 800 or 400 you can get it done go

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.270 
right 800 or 400 you can get it done go
to<00:04:17.130> convert<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.549> Sephora<00:04:17.880> Norton's<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.269> any

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
to convert the Sephora Norton's of any

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.210 
to convert the Sephora Norton's of any
then<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.430> may<00:04:20.580> want<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.880> go<00:04:21.000> with<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.209> pro<00:04:21.419> now

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
then you may want to go with the pro now

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.409 
then you may want to go with the pro now
right<00:04:23.220> now<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.700> little<00:04:24.000> bit<00:04:24.090> harder<00:04:24.390> for

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
right now it's a little bit harder for

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.470 
right now it's a little bit harder for
me<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.780> actually<00:04:24.930> argue<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.440> point<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.210> was

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
me to actually argue a point and it was

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.660 
me to actually argue a point and it was
for<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:28.290> go<00:04:28.440> with<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> pro<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.370> recent

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
for to go with the pro and the recent

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.040 
for to go with the pro and the recent
being<00:04:29.850> for<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.390> that's<00:04:30.600> gonna<00:04:30.810> change

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
being for that is that's gonna change

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.620 
being for that is that's gonna change
soon<00:04:31.350> enough<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:32.190> likely<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
soon enough it's likely now that the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.300 
soon enough it's likely now that the
next<00:04:33.930> model<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.380> suppose<00:04:34.740> after<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.160> release

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
next model I suppose after the release

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.710 
next model I suppose after the release
of<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.550> tablet<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.090> maybe<00:04:36.240> slightly<00:04:36.570> before

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
of the tablet and maybe slightly before

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.870 
of the tablet and maybe slightly before
the<00:04:37.320> MacBook<00:04:37.770> Pro<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.160> likely<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.550> go<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.700> get

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
the MacBook Pro is likely to go and get

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.220 
the MacBook Pro is likely to go and get
an<00:04:38.970> update<00:04:39.300> soon<00:04:39.540> now<00:04:39.720> people<00:04:39.960> are<00:04:40.020> going<00:04:40.110> to

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
an update soon now people are going to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.170 
an update soon now people are going to
ask<00:04:40.350> me<00:04:40.470> Dave<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:41.430> when<00:04:41.760> are<00:04:41.790> we<00:04:41.970> going<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
ask me Dave when when are we going to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.180 
ask me Dave when when are we going to
see<00:04:42.330> an<00:04:42.390> update<00:04:42.720> well<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.470> point<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.950> soon

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
see an update well this point is soon

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.030 
see an update well this point is soon
fact<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.730> matter<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.420> don't<00:04:45.780> know<00:04:46.080> but<00:04:46.830> it

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
fact the matter is I don't know but it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.410 
fact the matter is I don't know but it
probably<00:04:47.250> will<00:04:47.580> be<00:04:47.730> for<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.940> next<00:04:48.120> three<00:04:48.390> to

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
probably will be for the next three to

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.860 
probably will be for the next three to
four<00:04:48.630> months<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.400> this<00:04:50.400> will<00:04:50.760> then<00:04:51.090> have<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
four months and this will then have the

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.830 
four months and this will then have the
option<00:04:52.230> of<00:04:52.380> going<00:04:52.590> public<00:04:53.130> core<00:04:53.610> i5<00:04:54.060> maybe

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
option of going public core i5 maybe

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.870 
option of going public core i5 maybe
even<00:04:55.200> core<00:04:55.440> i3<00:04:55.560> which<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.190> really<00:04:56.370> just<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.610> bad

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
even core i3 which is really just a bad

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.600 
even core i3 which is really just a bad
score<00:04:57.210> t2<00:04:57.510> off<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.780> ask<00:04:57.900> me<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:58.770> Core<00:04:59.430> i5

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
score t2 off you ask me but Core i5

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.030 
score t2 off you ask me but Core i5
would<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.330> quad<00:05:00.690> core<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.320> these<00:05:01.440> entry<00:05:01.650> levels

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
would be quad core in these entry levels

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.410 
would be quad core in these entry levels
and<00:05:02.160> then<00:05:02.250> we'll<00:05:02.370> probably<00:05:02.460> see<00:05:02.730> like<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.000> 17

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
and then we'll probably see like the 17

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.090 
and then we'll probably see like the 17
inch<00:05:03.600> or<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.840> higher-end<00:05:04.050> 15<00:05:04.590> inch<00:05:04.770> model

going<00:05:05.310> core<00:05:05.550> i7<00:05:06.180> we<00:05:06.600> have<00:05:06.840> got<00:05:07.880> mobile<00:05:08.880> quad

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
going core i7 we have got mobile quad

going core i7 we have got mobile quad

the<00:05:12.090> difference<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.930> differentiator<00:05:13.650> right

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
the difference the differentiator right

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.090
