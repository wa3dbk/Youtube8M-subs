00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.599
 the first action of the match is from Puglia 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.759
 punishment almost from the flag hunted by pirrone for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.380
 wedding that alone in front of the door sends dramatically high

 bad weather skips men and repetition serves to musk that in 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 a first occasion is landed in the area but in the second it is served 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.920
 on the goal line he can't make a mistake, the 1 0 goal 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.500
 still longoni that gives numbers on the left and still ball in for 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 mosher to the 23rd but the conclusion of the number 9 giallorosso ends high above 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.060
 the crossbar 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.570
 at the half-hour punishment from the central position of the catanzaro longoni maps 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.580
 that ball that deviated from the barrier ends up in the hands of Morocco 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 such to you puts us in front of the manfredonia we eat a goal already done 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.740
 with naples that in front of the door sends out an excellent ball put in by 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.220
 sabatino 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.410
 at the 37th good pages of the catanzaro with montella but concludes on 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.500
 back of sabatino excellent whose closure 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.430
 4 danger for the door defended by with the thirty-eighth with a punishment of piero 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.540
 necchi deviart from the barrier 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.540
 ends the run out after almost ironing the pole 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.270
 you go to rest on a zero for the Giallorossi when they return to the field later 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.410
 just 7 minutes the goal of 2 to 0 arrives 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.570
 doors still of feet along the catanzaro edge the number 7 invents edit 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.910
 good-luck tins that we serve in front of the door in this case too 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.910
 bombas then stoneware push 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.439
 thanks for the material you do not have to wait for the violent controls the punishment of the piero 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.119
 united you stand high above the crossbar 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.369
 still very occasional for the catanzaro, they were moved first and then by montella 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.829
 they do however anticipate from the morocco 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.680
 then I try longoni in the area of ​​manfredonia waiting for an opponent 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.250
 firing a shot safe control extreme Apulian defender that you do find pro 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.429
 ready 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.719
 at the 68th manfredonia shortens the distance with wolves who intervenes on 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.019
 cross from the right and advances machines that good 2 a1 and was reopened 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.559
 the Catanzaro however checks that the 84th is dangerous again when it is 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.790
 come back to see us 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.020
 centralizing itself from the left, kicking towards porta dovo verona trento but little 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.049
 it's quardia that deviates in a corner 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.989
 nothing happens anymore the eagles win 2 to 1 and continue their march 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.189
 in short, at the top of the ranking
