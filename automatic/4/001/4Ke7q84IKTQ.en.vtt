from 12 to 12 I first had the well

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.910 
from 12 to 12 I first had the well

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
ambitious idea of going for a 24 hour

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.120 
ambitious idea of going for a 24 hour
stream<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.600> other<00:03:33.720> day<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> did<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.380> 16<00:03:35.010> hour

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
stream but the other day I did a 16 hour

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.340 
stream but the other day I did a 16 hour
stream<00:03:35.550> without<00:03:36.060> answering<00:03:36.720> questions<00:03:37.170> so

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
stream without answering questions so

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.530 
stream without answering questions so
just<00:03:37.560> chillin<00:03:38.010> doing<00:03:38.370> my<00:03:38.459> own<00:03:38.489> thing<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.060> that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
just chillin doing my own thing and that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.509 
just chillin doing my own thing and that
was<00:03:39.690> tiresome<00:03:40.110> enough<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.650> I'm<00:03:40.860> thinking<00:03:41.250> 12

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
was tiresome enough so I'm thinking 12

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.550 
was tiresome enough so I'm thinking 12
hours<00:03:41.850> spread<00:03:42.269> out<00:03:42.360> over<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.630> day<00:03:42.780> if<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.410> can

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
hours spread out over the day if I can

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.590 
hours spread out over the day if I can
even<00:03:43.650> make<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:43.950> much<00:03:44.239> sounds<00:03:45.239> like<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.390> good

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
even make that much sounds like a good

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.240 
even make that much sounds like a good
goal<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.110> it's<00:03:46.230> probably<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:46.739> from

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
goal so it's probably going to be from

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.180 
goal so it's probably going to be from
12<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.700> 12<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> 12<00:03:48.510> July<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.290> we'll<00:03:49.980> see
