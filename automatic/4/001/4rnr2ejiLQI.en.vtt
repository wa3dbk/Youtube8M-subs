00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello, I would be over the last week 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.700
 I'm sick of it because of that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.760
 a little strange but I wanted 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 anyway you mean the mps for today 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.759
 show the january and it's a very 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 Nice big bag and that's why 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.509
 we begin direct ran 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 the first thing you bought are the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.410
 berliner damp towels that are 150 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.000
 wet towels in such a plastic can 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 and I like to have my make-up table 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.570
 stand to wipe my hands or 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 to wipe the watchers the cost 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.309
 very little and for the face I would 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 they do not want to take but for the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.700
 Hands are enough in any case 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.559
 then yes only needs shampoo and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.450
 I 've got the hole from barea 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 I bought shampoo before I stood now 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 a few times because I also from 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.230
 Nature starts from less or curly hair 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 Of course today, not nature and me 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.020
 thought maybe it helps a bit 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.010
 to lure the natural ones better 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 to come out 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.980
 and I mean Lucy has that too 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.149
 mentioned video and says that works 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 that's why I just wanted to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.239
 Testing then needs a new one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 shaving gel and that's why I have that from 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 balda bought so far windeler and me 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.650
 Do not know if you smell like that but not 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 my god vanilla perfume is actually 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.320
 always there I have from cd that of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 scooter without aluminum salts bought 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 pomegranate in the scent direction 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.170
 I think that works relatively well 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 for that it has no aluminum salts 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.619
 I do not know what summer is but 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.299
 now with winter use it on everyone 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.070
 fall and therefore bought until after 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.619
 also after I bought the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.509
 cream soap party and buttermilk the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 quite amazingly delicious so pleasant 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.020
 fruity me so intrusive and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.810
 That's why I have the night in ours 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.090
 page he was then I twice the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.890
 balea professional europe express 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 Haarkur bought that is such a one 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.119
 minutes hq there are five each 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.890
 milliliter in such a tour so one 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.930
 Application and I think that was 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.560
 sometimes in between, because sometimes 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.729
 I like to use coconut oil masks though 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 you always need a little bit 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.820
 more time and when the hair is on 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 a little blah and you are easy 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.869
 quickly find what i need are always 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.549
 very nice then I have the ebeling 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.110
 bought brush cleaner and I have 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.430
 the first time I saw it was 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.110
 not in my usual dm 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.700
 because although already longer on the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.290
 Market is always with me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.020
 sold out I have never seen the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.129
 mgm seen and now somewhere else under 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.740
 they had the supplies 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.270
 this is a brush cleaner 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.790
 a spray bottle and I wanted that 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.740
 Try to brush around like that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.390
 quick to clean and costs 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.280
 I think four euros so clearly 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.410
 cheaper than the vision for example 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.910
 from mac and that's why thought tests the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.750
 one also reports so then I would be so 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 Like a toothbrush supersoft for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.540
 sensitive teeth I have 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.040
 sensitive gums and that's why 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.310
 doing more and more to relieve 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.960
 as well as the alverde 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.110
 transparent eyebrows goes with one 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.710
 new fragrance please now what to 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 First time I'll mean products 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.500
 I have been using this for a very long time 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 that for years and I like it too 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.320
 totally like to eyebrows 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 fix it because it really lasts a long time 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.750
 but the smell was always such 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.070
 a bit of course negative of course 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.330
 and it seems they have it now 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.670
 changed I find silly 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 in fact, that's right, I mean we 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.760
 We all complained but actually 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.910
 I do not care how the eyebrows 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.190
 court but good it has my job 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.750
 worthy and there I still have at the em 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.600
 bought two food things and that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.530
 once the chips baked in the kettle 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.090
 rosemary and sea ​​salt from alnatura the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.060
 judge even through the pack after 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 Easter is as high as in chips 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.910
 unbelievably delicious and they have one 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.570
 amazing short ingredient list so even 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.520
 not so bad 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.290
 and that's why I thought I'd like to come 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.200
 lima and then the apple likes with 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.150
 banana likewise and alnatura that is so 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 awesome i love that 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.080
 In the summer I have it glasses wise 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 So in the summer, it was thought probably has 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.960
 a toddler at home but no me 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.960
 Eat this ready for my life 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.340
 apple banana that so delicious and the one from 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.310
 a daughter is also without sugar 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.430
 that means only the natural fruit sweetness 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.570
 and I do not even try it out when 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.570
 her the combination of apple and banana 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.580
 but lives is just as tasty 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.120
 fresh from the fridge so freezing cold 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.140
 very good 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.060
 That's what all the products were for you 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.799
 dm bought but I am after that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.830
 again briefly to Rossmann and there have 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.660
 I also took a few things with me 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.610
 on the one hand this is a concealer 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.340
 from alterra and that is 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.080
 he is just concealer and the only 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.689
 I bought because it was so amazing 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.270
 bright is actually brighter than 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.110
 my skin and that does not happen often 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.530
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.509
 because that would be almost hannah as white 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.419
 I'm so pale that he's the least 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.789
 concealer are really lighter than mine 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.680
 skin tone and some would like to 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.169
 just like to have something here 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.569
 stops a bit and there I find 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.830
 just really rarely what have now 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.509
 I saw her and wanted him 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.919
 Try it because I think so too 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.840
 It costs three euros and I am very 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.639
 curious how he behaves so bright 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.259
 In any case , then ever have 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.759
 Although I bought usual suspects 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.650
 namely once the side panel washes 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.360
 and the oily also make up 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.370
 remover of rival praise that are 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.020
 long-term guests with me in the bathroom and me 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.000
 needed as a dry shampoo that is 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.250
 now that of alge marina I think that 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.189
 for the drugstore the best that costs 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.270
 I also believe three euros and I like 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.189
 Although that of butt is still on 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.319
 But the most beloved for the drugstore is that 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.569
 here by far the best thing you can 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.159
 can buy and at that time was all 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.139
 I now just signed up to now only 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.479
 that used here and I think 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.960
 that is not very pleasant either me 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.150
 come here 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.159
 and last but not least a hair cure of 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.800
 swiss upa and that the argan oil 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.930
 Haarkur and this without silicones and the 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.190
 I already had 23 times 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.629
 and I really really like them 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.569
 like just like those of 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:52.279
 Ballmer just that in the big tube 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.680
 I actually wanted that too 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.819
 buy but the em was not there and 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.409
 That's why I have them with me 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.389
 Rossmann bought otherwise I would have the 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.349
 small hook from because he finally arrived 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.159
 because I can find it 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.360
 actually more packaging 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.610
 always waste those little ones 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.020
 single portions to take but yes the 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.599
 I really like that hoe 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.219
 very much if you like dm wood 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.319
 looks then I link just next to 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.150
 me my last two dm of wood from the 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.669
 december and the month before 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.289
 and you can still watch and 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.180
 otherwise I wish you one more 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.900
 wonderful rest day and see you 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.900
