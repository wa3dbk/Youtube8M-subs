 still calling from the left and after 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.270
 running reaches the bottom line but the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.040
 crossing and for edinho bobeou pedro 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:24.470
 ken at the intersection looks at the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:24.470
 Juninho is from the Basque Juninho 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.340
 on the turn of the king on the turn of juninho 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 1 for the Basque or for the Fluminense 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.309
 the jealousy tagged jean edinho took 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.170
 mal and pedro ken gerou made the crossing to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 ball passed dog hair comes whole 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 Juninho hit hard and hit the corner 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.660
 no chances for cavalieri 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 Basque Juninho on the Basque Front 1 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 Fluminense 0 juninho pernambucano paulo 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.090
 césar vasconcellos first point there 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 Where did Edinho try to spout? 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 especially you do not have so much 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 quality as the case of the edinho 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.930
 Second time knowing it was worth it. 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.150
 hiring that player there are the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 initial movements of the second time to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.600
 you in sportv hd that's what i alone 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.000
 there was nothing 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 juninho ball well played for andré 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.080
 face to face eye goal 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.080
 cavalieri is still going with the goal 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.330
 is Basque 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.010
 andré andré makes the second 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.690
 early in the second stage andré 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.920
 cavalieri still touched the ball 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.560
 fell alone 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.990
 Juninho raised his head if the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 Gulf Coast Cavalieri still plays in 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.810
 but did not avoid the second goal of the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 Basque legal status of André 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.600
 from one face to face andré vasco 2 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.550
 Fluminense 0 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.590
 paulo cesar vasconcellos another one 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.420
 installment of the series was worth bringing 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.330
 back from Pernambuco and from that 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.090
 andré was needed at the conclusion of 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.010
 beak as you see it and run to check it out 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.920
 realized that the ball entering you take a 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.020
 goal with 33 seconds of the second half 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.630
 being disadvantaged with two goals and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 with one less it is obvious that the situation of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.880
 fluminense was much more complicated 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.780
 because this bass you will see there 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.780
 crossing at the entrance of the small 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:37.219
 he is from fluminense carlinhos once again 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.909
 Carlinhos works in the aerial game 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:45.170
 carlinhos decreases the fluminense makes the 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:47.810
 first head of the carlinhos 2 to the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.909
 Basque 1 for the Fluminense 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 beautiful image of the ball breaking in 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.349
 placed inside the goal 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.450
 carlinhos diminui paulo caesar 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.670
 vasconcellos the first fault of the nei 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.409
 does not leave the ground alliance're seeing 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.000
 In the second half, goalkeeper Diogo silva 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.159
 first time had already gone badly and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.290
 misjudged the ball's trajectory 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.419
 is the goal the Rio de Janeiro team needed because 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.709
 although Jesus is now going to put it on 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.970
 match two with a Rio de Janeiro 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.169
 fluminense has two less in this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.169
 moment the crossing 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:34.310
 of the Basque tenorio 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.450
 the Basque arrives at the third with two to 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.690
 more 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.920
 ranged from a corner kick 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.590
 3 for the Basque 1 for 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.330
 the fluminense 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.340
 I relax Basque at this moment paulo caesar is 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.080
 something that gives tranquility luiz 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.570
 tranquility that the Basque had lost 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.610
 after the Fluminense have done it has reduced 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.530
 the difference made his first goal 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.600
 Tenor went into this to be a man. 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.870
 within the area with andré 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.740
 falling over the sides of the field was 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.740
 evident missing
