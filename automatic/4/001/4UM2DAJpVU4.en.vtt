 hello youtube friends today I come to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.829
 teach a new tutorial where we will see 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.769
 how to install 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.600
 because this video game is a group with 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.600
 high definition for fish 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.070
 the file is its own so I've already tried it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.340
 and it should not have failures 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.550
 and the stupid remedy file support a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.590
 server to start going to look 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 our browser is opening 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.840
 favorite 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.820
 and we are going to paste the link that I have 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.820
 left in the video description 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.770
 once there 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:18.440
 this is half fault as you see only 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.280
 weighs 24 mb and should not have fire 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.510
 very played and does not weigh almost 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.510
 we expect from human 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 is going to start downloading once 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.869
 downloaded as I already have the changes 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.189
 they will have a wing which of this 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.210
 and we give you the right to extract or extract 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.510
 here 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.510
 as I already have it tells me that the oars 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
 replace 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.060
 once done we can eliminate the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.520
 server block and folder 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.009
 we open it and it contains all the data 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.130
 so they should not be deleted 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.189
 not even prepare them one by one and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.460
 get this desktop application and 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.460
 what is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.530
 In nothing 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.650
 the file this and this yes are up 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.110
 good if they want to validate it as a whole 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.510
 Original windows only let 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.190
 do it is very easy let's drag 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.090
 this application here to games and this 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.480
 they will have the game validated 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.019
 On your computer 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.069
