00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.790
 In general, I was killed a lot from cooking 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.599
 mines on a computer game the first time was 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 2002 when I arrived at the Olympic 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.910
 games I was very young enough 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.250
 inexperienced athletes and that time i'm not 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 quite like come to the realization at all 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.199
 what is the olympic games and when 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.890
 prepared for the second time performed in 1002 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.439
 year was not pleased with the results of 2006 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 year when i was preparing i knew what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 is this season one chance yes for 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 four years petals of the game and for me this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.920
 it was very serious already therefore 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.809
 and imposed a very large 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 responsibility apple yourself 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.300
 say too strict too careful 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.579
 in many moments and included achieve 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 good results in this regard 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.770
 This season's preparation for the Olympic 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 games are no different from others 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 olympic games such a sport is it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 when you go to the ice you can plan 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.840
 tactics do a lot of yourself some 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.540
 installations for example i have to go out there on 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 On such there but it turns out such a view 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 sports when you do not know when you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 pushed when you get around and because 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.009
 that of course you can think yes I will 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.950
 go at high speed I can all 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.360
 overtake but besides you on the rink very 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 many athletes who all want 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.250
 come forward and it turns out so what 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 would you imagine before going on the ice 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.710
 left installation always in real 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.689
 life getting completely different and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 precisely training tactics or training 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.280
 on that so my body's reaction to here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 these are all unexpected moments there 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.920
 someone fell 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.670
 it must 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.810
 on was the fastest and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.000
 accordingly, thanks to the tactics I can 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.909
 succeed on norrie is a man 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.100
 which is always next to me and for me 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.560
 there is a big difference if she or not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.479
 next to me because in those difficult 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.909
 moments she is always near 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.830
 she helps me with her presence 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.819
 focus fully on training 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.489
 on sports and when it happens that 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.709
 feel lonely and in these moments 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.860
 she comes to help me love 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.840

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.750
 but now I am a Russian citizen 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.610
 federations I can say that I am very 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.959
 thankful for this chance of everton me 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.230
 provided came here to train 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.680
 and perform olympic games and i 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 In principle, I still do not know what business 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.160
