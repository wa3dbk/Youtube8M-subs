are<00:02:25.250> better<00:02:25.340> than<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.670> ones<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.940> were<00:02:25.970> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
are better than the ones that were in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.000 
are better than the ones that were in
the<00:02:26.180> beta<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.720> my<00:02:26.930> opinion<00:02:27.230> they<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:27.830> they

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the beta in my opinion they kind of they

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
the beta in my opinion they kind of they
were<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.460> bad<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.690> will<00:02:29.840> definitely

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
were kind of bad but we will definitely

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.010 
were kind of bad but we will definitely
see<00:02:31.150> after<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.300> we<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:32.750> free

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
see after that we have the be free

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.750 
see after that we have the be free
wingman<00:02:33.380> which<00:02:33.590> looks<00:02:33.770> like<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.130> revolver

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
wingman which looks like a revolver

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.540

stuff<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.030> front<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.540> looks

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
stuff on the front so that looks

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.270 
stuff on the front so that looks
interesting<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.130> also<00:02:40.340> have<00:02:42.070> some<00:02:43.070> like

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
interesting and we also have some like

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.040 
interesting and we also have some like
some<00:02:43.580> grenades<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.180> sapper<00:02:44.420> charges<00:02:44.900> there

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
some grenades and sapper charges there

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.630 
some grenades and sapper charges there
are<00:02:45.110> no<00:02:45.230> pictures<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
are no pictures on this but you have the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.070 
are no pictures on this but you have the
satchel<00:02:47.060> charge<00:02:47.270> which<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.570> probably<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.050> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
satchel charge which is probably like a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530 
satchel charge which is probably like a
c4<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:49.310> have<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> arc<00:02:49.670> turning<00:02:49.970> frag<00:02:50.270> grenade

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
c4 you have the arc turning frag grenade

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.700 
c4 you have the arc turning frag grenade
which<00:02:50.690> were<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.020> beta<00:02:51.200> seared<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> know

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
which were in the beta seared I know

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.680 
which were in the beta seared I know
those<00:02:51.890> are<00:02:52.160> plus<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> arc<00:02:53.420> mine

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
those are plus you have the arc mine

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.080 
those are plus you have the arc mine
which<00:02:54.320> was<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> beta<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:55.850> that's

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
which was not in the beta so that's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.090 
which was not in the beta so that's
probably<00:02:56.420> kind<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:56.990> claymore<00:02:57.590> or

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
probably kind of like a claymore or

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.320 
probably kind of like a claymore or
bouncing<00:02:58.580> betty<00:02:58.760> or<00:02:58.910> something<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.240> that

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
bouncing betty or something like that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.880 
bouncing betty or something like that
from<00:02:59.600> coal<00:02:59.810> duty<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.260> we'll<00:03:00.410> definitely<00:03:00.710> have

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
from coal duty so we'll definitely have

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.860 
from coal duty so we'll definitely have
to<00:03:00.980> wait<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.400> see<00:03:01.460> for<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.240> but<00:03:02.540> moving<00:03:02.780> on

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
to wait and see for that but moving on

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.320 
to wait and see for that but moving on
to<00:03:03.050> tighten<00:03:03.410> weapons<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.760> first<00:03:04.970> four<00:03:05.150> don't

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
to tighten weapons the first four don't

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.700 
to tighten weapons the first four don't

foremost we have the 40 millimeter
cannon<00:03:23.240> which<00:03:23.360> was<00:03:23.480> obviously<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.959> beta

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
cannon which was obviously in the beta

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.230

two Titan weapons that we had available
in<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> beta<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.640> there<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.880> go<00:03:28.910> with<00:03:29.209> those

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
in the beta so there you go with those

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.980 
in the beta so there you go with those
but<00:03:30.110> next<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:31.130> sniper<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.330> says<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
plasma railgun so that looks pretty

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.240 
plasma railgun so that looks pretty
insane<00:03:36.200> actually<00:03:36.620> could<00:03:36.770> take<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> look<00:03:37.160> at

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
insane actually could take a look at

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.280
