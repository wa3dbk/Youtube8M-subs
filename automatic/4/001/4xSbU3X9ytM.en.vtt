00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.950
 Saturday night in Munich under the 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.019
 opera slogan for all the state opera 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 of Bavaria invites lovers of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.950
 classical music to an open air concert 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.190
 free 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.250
 the entrance is congested the public 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.619
 it's diverse opera fans together 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.770
 to techno fans wanting to 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.770
 dance 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.640
 they are here for golf antich who 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 reinterpret green 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 the star dj of the clubs mix 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.080
 his music with that of the famous composer 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 Italian the seats and the galleries are 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.730
 the public is empty for the first time 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.910
 uses the opera scenario as 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 dance floor the fandi is known for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.460
 his musical experiments is about 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.470
 introduce quotes and references from Verdi 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 in the context of a club where the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.310
 people are going to dance and move 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 have fun so I want to prove it I saw 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.239
 people who are still green is something very 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.239
 special and at the same time a huge challenge 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 the 500 tickets sold very fast 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.020
 the perfect idea reigns 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 seems to succeed 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 I think the place is fantastic this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.189
 space in this old building gives 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.189
 to the event a special touch 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.679
 surprised and delighted just that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.659
 combining both styles would surely be 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.610
 an experience with a unique result 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.710
 of times the public can know 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.780
 well the opera indeed the artists of the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.850
 Bavarian opera are integrated into the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860
 Paul's musical program we take advantage of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.080
 every opportunity to publicize the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.030
 opera through these events and to 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.030
 reach as many people as possible 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.869
 the fandi is one of the most famous DJs 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.060
 from germany and is also a pioneer of 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.880
 electronic music danceable its 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.000
 career began in 1990 on the scene of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.510
 Berlin techno today knows all the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 world 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.849
 it's not his first experiment with the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.950
 classical music in 2009 finally made 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.959
 a project with directors toÃ±o for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.959
 boyer I saw in Frankfurt the memo 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.140
 yes 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.629
 in the presentation in Munich they will be 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.280
 reinterpreted classical pieces verdi 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.280
 according to electronic music 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.000
 therefore he works with several soloists 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.000
 the Bavarian state opera 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.579
 it seems great to me that in this way 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.829
 young people go to the opera something that does not 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.500
 it's not easy and I also like that the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.269
 djs come here to them it seems like a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.420
 good place to attract an audience 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.609
 young man who usually goes to nightclubs and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.319
 on the other hand, awakening in the public of 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.319
 the opera the enthusiasm for the beat 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.650
 the dj has above all a goal 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.709
 my goal logically is to make the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.750
 people dance clear that there are a couple of 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.269
 surprises especially when over 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.370
 classic with peace 4x4 to which I am 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.829
 accustomed to the beat three times four 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.109
 from green to some will cost you a stumble 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.290
 but it's really fun to give more tips 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.290
 plus 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.240
 techno and classical music the idea is not 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.880
 novel but this way of dancing in 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.880
 the stage of the opera is something unpublished
