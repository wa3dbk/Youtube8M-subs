we're using these huge hammer on
particle<00:00:54.000> systems<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> explosions<00:00:55.289> just

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
particle systems so the explosions just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
particle systems so the explosions just
have<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.219> classic<00:00:56.879> cartoon<00:00:57.300> maybe

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so you've got some two chaining on it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
so you've got some two chaining on it
hand<00:01:01.350> painted<00:01:01.590> backgrounds<00:01:02.190> we've<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.579> some

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
hand painted backgrounds we've got some

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
hand painted backgrounds we've got some
cool<00:01:02.879> normal<00:01:03.210> map<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> tricks<00:01:04.170> we're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cool normal map kind of tricks we're

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
cool normal map kind of tricks we're
doing<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> lights<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.880> explosions

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
doing so that the lights the explosions

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.340 
doing so that the lights the explosions
stuff<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.600> actually<00:01:06.810> light<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
stuff will actually light up and you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
stuff will actually light up and you
like<00:01:07.500> cast<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.189> rocks<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> stuff<00:01:08.790> like

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
like cast off the rocks and stuff like

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.480 
like cast off the rocks and stuff like
that<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> AI<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:10.500> deep<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that and the AI is very deep the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
that and the AI is very deep the
inspiration<00:01:12.240> originally<00:01:12.570> came<00:01:12.659> from<00:01:12.780> but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
inspiration originally came from but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
inspiration originally came from but
basically<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.380> something<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> halo<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
basically like something like a halo in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359 
basically like something like a halo in
2d<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> tactical<00:01:17.220> combat

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
2d so the same kind of tactical combat

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
2d so the same kind of tactical combat
and<00:01:17.759> let<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:17.970> shields<00:01:18.240> recharge<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and let your shields recharge and the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
and let your shields recharge and the
squad<00:01:19.530> talk<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.040> tactics<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
squad talk you know tactics or the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.890 
squad talk you know tactics or the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
they're calling for backup and you know

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
they're calling for backup and you know

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
are kind of hand design and then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
are kind of hand design and then
surrounding<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.259> there's<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.530> huge

asteroid fields in like deep space it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
asteroid fields in like deep space it's
all<00:01:51.810> procedurally<00:01:52.200> generated<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.189> sort<00:01:53.399> of

the missions and you know the whole

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.150 
the missions and you know the whole
world<00:02:07.720> feels<00:02:08.020> very<00:02:08.200> alive<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:08.920> just

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
world feels very alive and you can just

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.350 
world feels very alive and you can just
play<00:02:09.460> around<00:02:09.490> out<00:02:09.850> there<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.150> a<00:02:10.210> great

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
play around out there and have a great

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.790 
play around out there and have a great
time<00:02:10.540> for<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.780> long<00:02:10.900> time<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.410> can<00:02:11.530> fly<00:02:11.680> from

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
time for a long time you can fly from

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.560 
time for a long time you can fly from
better<00:02:12.010> planet<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.520> then<00:02:12.610> each<00:02:12.730> system<00:02:13.360> is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
better planet and then each system is

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.520 
better planet and then each system is
kind<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.960> self-contained<00:02:14.320> system

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
kind of like a self-contained system

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.080 
kind of like a self-contained system
that<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.010> can<00:02:15.130> basically<00:02:15.280> fly<00:02:15.730> around<00:02:15.850> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that you can basically fly around that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.300 
that you can basically fly around that
whole<00:02:16.240> system<00:02:16.480> it'll<00:02:17.320> be<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> couple<00:02:17.770> levels<00:02:17.920> in

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
whole system it'll be a couple levels in

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.220 
whole system it'll be a couple levels in
that<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.850> then<00:02:19.000> you'll<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.300> get<00:02:19.630> your<00:02:19.720> main

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that and then you'll like get your main

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.600 
that and then you'll like get your main
ship<00:02:20.470> powered<00:02:20.710> up<00:02:20.800> enough<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.100> make<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.310> warp

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
ship powered up enough to make a warp

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.340 
ship powered up enough to make a warp
and<00:02:21.850> jump<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> another<00:02:22.330> system<00:02:22.540> there's<00:02:23.080> big

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
and jump to another system there's big

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.870 
and jump to another system there's big
scary<00:02:23.770> dudes<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.850> really

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
scary dudes out there that you really

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.550 
scary dudes out there that you really
shouldn't<00:02:25.600> deal<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.110> until<00:02:26.320> you're<00:02:26.440> more

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
shouldn't deal with until you're more

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.210 
shouldn't deal with until you're more
powered<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:26.890> later

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
powered up later

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.800 
powered up later
they<00:02:27.430> kind<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.640> patrol<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> perimeter<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
they kind of patrol the perimeter of the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.060 
they kind of patrol the perimeter of the
asteroid<00:02:29.080> fields<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> watch<00:02:29.770> out<00:02:29.950> for

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
asteroid fields you got to watch out for

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.310 
asteroid fields you got to watch out for
them<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:30.490> taking<00:02:30.760> them<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:30.970> leads<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.930> huge

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
them but taking them on leads to huge

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.480 
them but taking them on leads to huge
rewards<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.040> riches<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.770> compared<00:02:36.400> to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
rewards and riches so I compared to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.060 
rewards and riches so I compared to
Super<00:02:36.790> Metroid<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.300> lot<00:02:37.630> like<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.650> start<00:02:38.950> off

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
Super Metroid a lot like you start off

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.250 
Super Metroid a lot like you start off
you<00:02:39.460> know<00:02:39.550> some<00:02:39.760> health<00:02:39.940> some<00:02:40.450> weapons<00:02:40.960> but

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
you know some health some weapons but

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.540 
you know some health some weapons but
you'll<00:02:41.380> get<00:02:41.530> better<00:02:41.710> weapons<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.190> get<00:02:42.370> more

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you'll get better weapons you get more

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.890 
you'll get better weapons you get more
health<00:02:42.760> pack<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.210> get<00:02:43.330> better<00:02:43.390> shields

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
health pack so you get better shields

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.180 
health pack so you get better shields
and<00:02:43.990> get<00:02:44.080> better<00:02:44.200> abilities<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.950> kind<00:02:45.160> of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and get better abilities you kind of
