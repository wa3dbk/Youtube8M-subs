here that Frank has just picked up in
his<00:01:44.479> hand<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.679> stock<00:01:45.979> piston<00:01:46.579> out<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.880> a

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
his hand is the stock piston out of a

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.929 
his hand is the stock piston out of a
400<00:01:47.420> L<00:01:47.569> Polaris<00:01:48.139> the<00:01:48.409> one<00:01:49.009> here<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.579> you

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
400 L Polaris the one here is a you

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.080 
400 L Polaris the one here is a you
albeit<00:01:50.389> used<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:51.259> wide<00:01:51.859> scope<00:01:52.130> piston<00:01:52.549> that<00:01:52.759> is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
albeit used a wide scope piston that is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.370 
albeit used a wide scope piston that is
also<00:01:53.420> out<00:01:53.569> of<00:01:53.689> a<00:01:53.779> 400<00:01:54.319> Polaris<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.169> best

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
also out of a 400 Polaris this is best

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.620 
also out of a 400 Polaris this is best
way<00:01:57.529> I<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.649> illustrate<00:01:57.979> what<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.999> problem<00:01:59.450> is

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
way I can illustrate what the problem is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.529 
way I can illustrate what the problem is
with<00:01:59.869> these<00:02:00.049> motors<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:01.729> Pistons<00:02:02.179> in

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
with these motors and the Pistons in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.929 
with these motors and the Pistons in
them<00:02:03.039> Franks<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.130> illustrate<00:02:04.639> just<00:02:04.669> how

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
them Franks and illustrate just how

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.029 
them Franks and illustrate just how
easily<00:02:05.270> these<00:02:05.659> Pistons<00:02:06.200> are

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
easily these Pistons are

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.479 
easily these Pistons are
and<00:02:08.549> as<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.890> once<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.189> a<00:02:11.220> piece

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and as you can see once you get a piece

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.699 
and as you can see once you get a piece
off<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.790> them<00:02:15.260> they'll<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.319> fall<00:02:16.680> right

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
off of them they'll just fall right

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.690 
off of them they'll just fall right
apart<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
apart on you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:27.430 
apart on you
now<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> Y's<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.599> piston<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> other<00:02:19.349> hand

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:43.520 

smack<00:02:35.540> pretty<00:02:36.540> tough

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
this one had a big bore kit put in it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.050 
this one had a big bore kit put in it
probably<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.349> early<00:03:05.380> 90s<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.910> in

not for service again the Pistons are

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.280 
not for service again the Pistons are
getting<00:03:10.060> very<00:03:10.269> hard<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.720> come<00:03:10.900> by<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
getting very hard to come by and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.440 
getting very hard to come by and
frequently<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.830> jobs<00:03:12.099> like<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.269> to

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
frequently on jobs like this we have to

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.830 
frequently on jobs like this we have to
basically<00:03:13.690> make<00:03:14.470> our<00:03:14.650> own<00:03:14.830> piston<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.840> we

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
basically make our own piston for it we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.330 
basically make our own piston for it we
see<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.080> lot<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.260> new<00:03:17.470> machines<00:03:17.860> go<00:03:18.099> through
