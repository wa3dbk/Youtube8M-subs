00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.360
 so much of what is regulation to control or in some way organize 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.330
 this development 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 of what biofuels are in this region john paul accompanies us 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.200
 bonilla delphi el tinno sixth studios in washintong a palop 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.439
 We talked and we saw in the history of Brazil that we are already 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.240
 occupying the government on this issue of what is regular 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.820
 is that you are working on this particular also 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.770
 what are those work areas in which you are working and with what 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.930
 countries 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.040
 for that reason the hiv through the initiative of sustainable energy and change 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 is working with the countries to establish the regulatory framework 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.820
 seeing all the multidisciplinary biofuels of the agricultural part of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.070
 the environmental part of the energy part and the social part 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.440
 for that we are going to elaborate biofuel action plans we are already in 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.220
 misano with at least five or six countries of the region we are safe 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.370
 that next year 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.120
 We are working in at least 10 countries in the region this end 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.520
 the same rules are displayed and what kind of rules are being developed by the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.350
 visitor the same for all countries or not 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.390
 very important point and case of Brazil 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.210
 It has been a case of more than 25 30 years of work 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.240
 that by its scale Álvarez is going to see issues that I can lose so others that do not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.729
 and it is very clear that the subject of biofuels the reality of each 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.460
 country is specific 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.079
 and what exactly these rules should say for example 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 first see availability of land will be the input to proceed to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.480
 any kind of okumu style land availability 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.120
 which are suitable lands of the point of view agricole climatic sportsman 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.630
 and that they are not incompetent as already mentioned or with food and with the subject 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.410
 environmental 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.100
 in the second of the subject of energy regulation 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.580
 first if you compare it produce biofuels for internal consumption 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.480
 much of the country are included as a mandatory part of the mix of the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.390
 10% ethanol gasoline for example 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.330
 desi sufficient land to reach that 10% and then think of the option of the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.720
 export chad beyer in one way or another as biofuels help 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.550
 diversify the energy matrix countries and before joining the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.970
 transport issue that is linked to climate change that a topic that I 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.499
 like to play later 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.639
 third the environmental part without any doubt first that the earth using 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.639
 affect natural reserves percent 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.209
 and second, the water issue is indispensable 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.200
 countries like yours like in mexico some biofuels issues have to 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.659
 be very careful 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.779
 with the theme of water, mainly irrigation 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.649
 and finally the social part 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.069
 see the positive impact of biofuels employment generation 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.909
 but of German miguel so that it is done in a respectful way put to 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.059
 the international standard for him these rules are not going to work if the 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:47.429
 temptation is still found and for some producers to change those 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.470
 crops because the pricing environment 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.499
 It's a lot 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.510
 of who learns that these rules work is my last question in this 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.510
 opportunity we invite you to talk about changing the climate change in 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.109
 another future almost six 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.299
 it basically depends on having good regulation and tracking and in that 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.919
 you have to work with the government on a day-to-day basis for the two issues 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.180
 legendary producers and of course without it it has to be something 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.699
 jointly public-private sector 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.129
 juan pablo ponce I thank you very much this opportunity to talk against 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.509

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.540
