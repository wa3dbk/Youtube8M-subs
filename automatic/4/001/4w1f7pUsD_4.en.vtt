let's<00:00:00.210> break<00:00:00.450> it<00:00:00.599> up<00:00:00.659> into<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.260> recovery<00:00:01.709> now

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
let's break it up into the recovery now

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120 
let's break it up into the recovery now
as<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.850> hand<00:00:03.120> extends<00:00:03.810> into<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.440> recovery<00:00:04.710> I

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
as the hand extends into the recovery I

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.340 
as the hand extends into the recovery I
want<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.910> make<00:00:06.029> sure<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:07.049> there's<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.319> good

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
want to make sure that there's a good

want to make sure that there's a good
extension<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> arms<00:00:08.670> but<00:00:09.090> very<00:00:09.420> relaxed

extension in the arms but very relaxed
through<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> fingertips<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.730> want<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> see

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
through the fingertips so I want to see

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
through the fingertips so I want to see
this<00:00:12.509> type<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.840> action<00:00:13.170> directly<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.040> line

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this type of action directly in line

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.589 
this type of action directly in line
with<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> shoulders

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
with the shoulders

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.900 
with the shoulders
some<00:00:16.320> people<00:00:16.619> make<00:00:16.770> mistake<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> come<00:00:17.580> across

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
some people make mistake and come across

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
some people make mistake and come across
the<00:00:18.090> body<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:19.050> want<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.410> sure<00:00:19.439> it's

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the body we want to make sure it's

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
the body we want to make sure it's
relaxed<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> direct<00:00:20.910> line<00:00:21.350> coaches<00:00:22.350> often

relaxed and direct line coaches often

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.009 
relaxed and direct line coaches often
tell<00:00:22.830> us<00:00:22.859> women<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.400> extend<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
tell us women to really extend here that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.620 
tell us women to really extend here that
can<00:00:25.230> affect<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> rest<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.580> body<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.539> we

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
can affect the rest of the body so we

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.210 
can affect the rest of the body so we
want<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> make<00:00:27.960> sure<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> shoulders<00:00:28.980> is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
want to make sure that the shoulders is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
want to make sure that the shoulders is
out<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> water<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.660> relaxed<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.289> still

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
out of the water but relaxed but still

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.250 
out of the water but relaxed but still
part<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> body<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:33.030> comes<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
part of the body as it comes in to the

part of the body as it comes in to the
back<00:00:34.410> part<00:00:34.649> into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> stroke<00:00:36.260> now<00:00:37.260> just

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
back part into the stroke now just

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
back part into the stroke now just
before<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:38.040> go<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> catch<00:00:38.760> position<00:00:39.360> we

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
before we go into the catch position we

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.860 
before we go into the catch position we
want<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.200> sure<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> hand<00:00:41.879> rotates

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
want to make sure that the hand rotates

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.310 
want to make sure that the hand rotates
out<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.040> body<00:00:44.280> rotates<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.539> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out and the body rotates with that this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
out and the body rotates with that this
is<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> call<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> power<00:00:47.219> zone<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
is what I call the power zone we want to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
is what I call the power zone we want to
make<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> last<00:00:49.770> part<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
make sure that this last part of the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
make sure that this last part of the
stroke<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.059> come<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> put<00:00:52.559> our<00:00:52.680> hand<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
stroke as we come in and put our hand in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
stroke as we come in and put our hand in
the<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> arm<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.899> still<00:00:55.230> directly

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the water that the arm is still directly

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490 
the water that the arm is still directly
in<00:00:55.829> front<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.030> chest<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.320> more

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
in front of the chest it's a much more

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
in front of the chest it's a much more
powerful<00:00:58.739> position<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
powerful position to get on and get on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.229 
powerful position to get on and get on
the<00:01:01.230> stroke<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.770> backstroke<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.789> having<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the stroke in backstroke then having the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
the stroke in backstroke then having the
arm<00:01:03.390> behind<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.080> shoulders<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> timing

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
arm behind the shoulders so the timing

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.899 
arm behind the shoulders so the timing
of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> rotation<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.750> crucial<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> once<00:01:08.760> we

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of the rotation is crucial so once we

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.320 
of the rotation is crucial so once we
get<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> hand<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.260> position<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.330> think

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
get the hand into the position I think

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
get the hand into the position I think
the<00:01:12.720> crucial<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the crucial thing is that there is a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.480 
the crucial thing is that there is a
connection<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.210> arm<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.290> body<00:01:16.500> too

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
connection of the arm to the body too

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
connection of the arm to the body too
many<00:01:17.670> swimmers<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> mistake<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> trying

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
many swimmers make the mistake of trying

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
many swimmers make the mistake of trying
to<00:01:19.439> pull<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:20.520> hard<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.210> their<00:01:21.450> backstroke

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to pull really hard in their backstroke

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.070 
to pull really hard in their backstroke
and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.740> find<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.820> like

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and I find when they do that it's like

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.179 
and I find when they do that it's like
you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.110> trying<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> put<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> accelerator

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you know trying to put the accelerator

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
you know trying to put the accelerator
on<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.420> car<00:01:27.659> trying<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> drive<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.619> snow

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
on when your car trying to drive in snow

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.170 
on when your car trying to drive in snow
I<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.430> you've<00:01:29.549> ever<00:01:29.610> done<00:01:29.759> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I don't know if you've ever done that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.929 
I don't know if you've ever done that
but<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> spins<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> important<00:01:32.790> thing

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
but it just spins so the important thing

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.399 
but it just spins so the important thing
is<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.479> onto<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> catch<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
is that they get onto the catch of the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.310 
is that they get onto the catch of the
stroke<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.700> feel<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.840> pressure

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
stroke they get that feel the pressure

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
stroke they get that feel the pressure
on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> water<00:01:38.030> later<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.240> we'll<00:01:39.390> talk<00:01:39.420> about

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
on the water later on we'll talk about

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.319 
on the water later on we'll talk about
some<00:01:39.990> ways<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.500> develop<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.880> feel

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
some ways that we can develop that feel

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.590 
some ways that we can develop that feel
that<00:01:42.899> all-important<00:01:43.439> feel<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> stroke

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
that all-important feel for the stroke

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
that all-important feel for the stroke
so<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.020> notice<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.380> hand<00:01:46.680> go<00:01:46.860> into<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so when we notice a hand go into the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
so when we notice a hand go into the
water<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> connection<00:01:49.170> from

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
water where there is a connection from

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.530 
water where there is a connection from
the<00:01:49.439> core<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> actually<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> bring

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the core and we actually want to bring

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.520 
the core and we actually want to bring
the<00:01:51.659> body<00:01:52.340> towards<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> hand<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.869> we

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the body towards the hand so as we

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
the body towards the hand so as we
rotate<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> people<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
rotate so a lot of people make the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
rotate so a lot of people make the
mistake<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.350> staying<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> body<00:01:59.100> staying

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
mistake of staying on the body staying

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.319 
mistake of staying on the body staying
sideways<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.619> rotating<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:03.060> want<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
sideways and not rotating we want to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
sideways and not rotating we want to
make<00:02:03.450> sure<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.049> connection<00:02:04.680> here

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
make sure that there's a connection here

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.910 
make sure that there's a connection here
and<00:02:05.159> then<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.149> pull<00:02:06.420> through<00:02:06.810> our<00:02:07.649> body

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and then as we pull through our body

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.240 
and then as we pull through our body
rotates<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.270> give<00:02:09.450> us<00:02:09.539> most<00:02:09.840> power<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:11.039> very

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
rotates so give us most power it's very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949 
rotates so give us most power it's very
similar<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.360> wanted<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.720> throw<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959

the<00:02:14.970> timing<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.629> crucial<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.620> give<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the timing is crucial to give it the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.160 
the timing is crucial to give it the
most<00:02:17.099> power<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:18.060> we're<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.360> little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.750> late<00:02:18.959> in

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
most power if we're a little bit late in

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.270 
most power if we're a little bit late in
our<00:02:19.290> timing<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.750> then<00:02:21.750> rotate<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.950> won't<00:02:23.159> get

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
our timing and then rotate we won't get

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.210 
our timing and then rotate we won't get
that<00:02:23.459> same<00:02:23.730> power<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.170> connection<00:02:25.799> under

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that same power so the connection under

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.780 
that same power so the connection under
the<00:02:26.340> lats

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790

that's<00:02:27.299> what's<00:02:27.540> Daniel<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.079> he<00:02:28.500> presses<00:02:29.040> down

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
that's what's Daniel as he presses down

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.360 
that's what's Daniel as he presses down
on<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:30.629> side<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.079> pool<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.620> he<00:02:32.040> gets<00:02:32.250> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
on the side of the pool and he gets that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.089 
on the side of the pool and he gets that
