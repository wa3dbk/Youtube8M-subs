00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the mint as a guideline you can see that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.289 
the mint as a guideline you can see that
it's<00:01:05.710> mixed<00:01:05.890> out<00:01:06.159> evenly<00:01:06.760> throughout<00:01:07.119> the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
it's mixed out evenly throughout the

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's mixed out evenly throughout the
entire<00:01:07.630> thing<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:09.180> therefore<00:01:10.180> you're<00:01:10.360> ready

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
entire thing so therefore you're ready

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.100 
entire thing so therefore you're ready
to<00:01:10.690> go

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
to go

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.430 
to go
you'll<00:01:11.980> be<00:01:12.100> very<00:01:12.310> careful<00:01:12.790> when<00:01:12.910> cutting<00:01:13.090> in

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
you'll be very careful when cutting in

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.310 
you'll be very careful when cutting in
two<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.710> go<00:01:14.890> through<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.370> one<00:01:15.580> side<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
two just go through the one side of the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.820 
two just go through the one side of the
date<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.970> especially<00:01:18.970> not<00:01:19.330> your<00:01:19.570> finger<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
date and especially not your finger so

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.960 
date and especially not your finger so
if<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.010> notice<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:24.400> didn't<00:01:24.610> put<00:01:24.730> any<00:01:24.760> sugar

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
if you notice we didn't put any sugar

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.500 
if you notice we didn't put any sugar
into<00:01:25.810> our<00:01:25.920> cream<00:01:26.920> cheese<00:01:26.950> mixture<00:01:27.510> because

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
into our cream cheese mixture because

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.780 
into our cream cheese mixture because
dates<00:01:28.780> are<00:01:28.990> extremely<00:01:29.830> too<00:01:29.950> sweet<00:01:30.220> naturally

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
dates are extremely too sweet naturally

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.490 
dates are extremely too sweet naturally
so<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.210> can<00:01:31.420> see<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> actual<00:01:32.110> sugar

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
so you can see the actual sugar

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.770 
so you can see the actual sugar
crystallization<00:01:33.340> inside<00:01:33.760> so<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:34.540> would<00:01:34.659> be

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
crystallization inside so it would be

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.470 
crystallization inside so it would be
redundant<00:01:35.230> for<00:01:35.440> us<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.680> add<00:01:35.800> more<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.480> and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
redundant for us to add more to that and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.050 
redundant for us to add more to that and
we'll<00:01:37.570> just<00:01:37.750> take<00:01:37.870> our<00:01:37.900> cream<00:01:38.230> cheese<00:01:38.470> mixture

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
we'll just take our cream cheese mixture

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.940 
we'll just take our cream cheese mixture
put<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.210> inside<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.920> close<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.400> up<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.830> then

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
put it inside and close it up and then

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.219 
put it inside and close it up and then
we'll<00:01:48.040> take<00:01:48.190> our<00:01:48.340> trusty<00:01:48.580> fingers<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.510> clean

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
we'll take our trusty fingers and clean

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.380 
we'll take our trusty fingers and clean
them<00:01:50.440> up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.450
