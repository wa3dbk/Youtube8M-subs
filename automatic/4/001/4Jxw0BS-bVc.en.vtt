on aluminum flashing now can argue about

on aluminum flashing now can argue about
efficiencies<00:01:09.439> there<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.740> insulation<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
efficiencies there is some insulation in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
efficiencies there is some insulation in
the<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.580> too<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.150> side<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> could

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the back too and on the side this could

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.080 
the back too and on the side this could
be<00:01:14.580> riser<00:01:14.850> pattern<00:01:15.560> better<00:01:16.560> flow<00:01:16.890> rate<00:01:17.189> but

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
be riser pattern better flow rate but

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.609 
be riser pattern better flow rate but
then<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> bunch<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> joints<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
then you got a bunch of joints you got a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
then you got a bunch of joints you got a
solder<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> failure

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
solder and then you could have a failure

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.620 
solder and then you could have a failure
at<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> solder<00:01:21.840> joint<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> pissing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
at a solder joint so it's not a pissing

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
at a solder joint so it's not a pissing
contest<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> best<00:01:28.860> designer<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.549> most

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
contest about the best designer the most

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
contest about the best designer the most
efficient<00:01:30.240> design<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.009> personally<00:01:32.009> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
efficient design I think personally it's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.999 
efficient design I think personally it's
about<00:01:32.450> doesn't<00:01:33.450> work<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> keep<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
about doesn't work and can you keep the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
about doesn't work and can you keep the
cost<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.509> at<00:01:36.509> least<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.869> something<00:01:37.079> going

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
cost down at least get something going

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.500 
cost down at least get something going
so

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.730 
so
this<00:01:39.110> was<00:01:39.290> frozen<00:01:39.620> about<00:01:40.310> an<00:01:40.460> hour<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.000> ago<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
this was frozen about an hour so ago the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.460 
this was frozen about an hour so ago the
water<00:01:45.950> texture<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:47.110> 45:46<00:01:48.110> we<00:01:48.920> around<00:01:49.760> there

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
water texture is 45:46 we around there

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.670 
water texture is 45:46 we around there
so<00:01:51.470> we're<00:01:51.620> using<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.890> DC<00:01:52.130> pump<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.530> we're

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
so we're using a DC pump and we're

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.680 
so we're using a DC pump and we're
pumping<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.070> water<00:01:55.100> out<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> tank<00:01:55.970> into

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
pumping the water out of the tank into

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.630 
pumping the water out of the tank into
the<00:01:56.870> serpentine<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.950> then<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:58.220> coming<00:01:58.430> back

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the serpentine and then it's coming back

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.510 
the serpentine and then it's coming back
around<00:01:58.820> back<00:01:59.420> down<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.070> could<00:02:01.160> use<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.400> for

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
around back down so you could use it for

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.780 
around back down so you could use it for
livestock<00:02:02.620> keeping<00:02:03.620> livestock<00:02:03.800> tank<00:02:04.400> open

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
livestock keeping livestock tank open

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.870 
livestock keeping livestock tank open
during<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> day<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.250> use<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.610> for

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
during the day you can use it for

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.880 
during the day you can use it for
radiant<00:02:08.600> floor<00:02:08.960> heating<00:02:09.230> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> greenhouse

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
radiant floor heating in the greenhouse

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.760 
radiant floor heating in the greenhouse
lots<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.640> different<00:02:10.970> things

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
lots of different things
