then we move back here to our freak it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.130 
then we move back here to our freak it's
attached<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.970> deck<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.930> like

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
attached to the deck so it's not like

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.949 
attached to the deck so it's not like
one<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.530> those<00:02:19.680> spring<00:02:20.160> spring<00:02:20.970> breaks<00:02:21.239> that

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
one of those spring spring breaks that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.470 
one of those spring spring breaks that
moves<00:02:22.379> like<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> whole<00:02:22.890> thing<00:02:23.129> if<00:02:23.400> flex<00:02:24.269> is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
moves like the whole thing if flex is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.920 
moves like the whole thing if flex is
about<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.370> stops<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.580> wheel<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
about right here and stops the wheel and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.680 
about right here and stops the wheel and
it's<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.980> nicely<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.519> home<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it's very nicely at home it's got a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.199 
it's very nicely at home it's got a
little<00:02:30.810> compound<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.890> here<00:02:32.209> that

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
little compound like right in here that

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.290 
little compound like right in here that
will<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:34.140> wear<00:02:34.319> down<00:02:34.530> or<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.790> break<00:02:36.030> might

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
will not wear down or your break might

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
will not wear down or your break might
lightly<00:02:36.810> we're<00:02:36.989> down<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.500> mean<00:02:37.709> over<00:02:37.920> time

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
lightly we're down I mean over time

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
lightly we're down I mean over time
because<00:02:38.489> that's<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.150> unavoidable<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.440> it's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
because that's like unavoidable but it's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.110 
because that's like unavoidable but it's
not<00:02:40.799> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> wear<00:02:41.190> down<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.400> wheels<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.940> any

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
not going to wear down the wheels in any

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.870 
not going to wear down the wheels in any
way<00:02:42.410> which<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.620> very<00:02:43.860> nice<00:02:44.099> because<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.700> don't

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
way which is very nice because I don't

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.580 
way which is very nice because I don't
want<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.180> buying<00:02:45.510> those<00:02:45.750> every<00:02:46.110> 20<00:02:46.410> minutes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
want to be buying those every 20 minutes

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.199 
want to be buying those every 20 minutes
and<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.290> yeah<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.560> pretty<00:02:50.069> nice<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.940> pretty

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
