00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
brewing in the metro you're thrust into

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.539 
brewing in the metro you're thrust into
it<00:01:11.140> trying<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.500> make<00:01:11.680> sense<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.159> madness

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
it trying to make sense of the madness

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.190 
it trying to make sense of the madness
and<00:01:12.759> it's<00:01:13.240> pretty<00:01:13.450> much<00:01:13.540> all<00:01:13.720> we're<00:01:13.840> ready<00:01:14.020> to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
and it's pretty much all we're ready to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.700 
and it's pretty much all we're ready to
give<00:01:14.320> away<00:01:14.409> about<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.860> story<00:01:15.340> right<00:01:15.520> now

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.430 

I<00:01:19.299> think<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.049> saw<00:01:21.260> in<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
I think what you what you saw in the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.590 
I think what you what you saw in the
demo<00:01:21.560> today<00:01:21.860> was<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> real<00:01:22.790> focus<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.299> try<00:01:23.479> and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
demo today was a real focus to try and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.270 
demo today was a real focus to try and
address<00:01:23.780> some<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.799> think<00:01:25.010> valid

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
address some of the the I think valid

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.770 
address some of the the I think valid
criticisms<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:25.970> first<00:01:26.210> game<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.659> we've

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
criticisms of the first game so we've

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.050 
criticisms of the first game so we've
completely<00:01:27.200> overhauled<00:01:27.770> are<00:01:28.040> our<00:01:28.340> stealth

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
completely overhauled are our stealth

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630 
completely overhauled are our stealth
combat<00:01:29.869> we've<00:01:30.590> added<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.890> lot<00:01:31.010> more<00:01:31.070> dynamic

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
combat we've added a lot more dynamic

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.580 
combat we've added a lot more dynamic
destruction<00:01:32.180> which<00:01:32.360> has<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.540> real<00:01:32.810> effect<00:01:33.229> on

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
destruction which has a real effect on

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.130 
destruction which has a real effect on
the<00:01:33.680> combat<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.610> during<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.450> demo<00:01:35.780> cover

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the combat now so during the demo cover

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.749 
the combat now so during the demo cover
crumbling<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.920> bullet<00:01:37.280> fire<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.640> have

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
crumbling and the bullet fire you have

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.550 
crumbling and the bullet fire you have
to<00:01:37.909> move<00:01:38.060> from<00:01:38.240> place<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.630> place<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:39.380> really

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
to move from place to place it really

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.010 
to move from place to place it really
kind<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.800> changes<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.220> feel<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.300> combat

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
kind of changes the feel of the combat

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.870 
kind of changes the feel of the combat
in<00:01:42.140> there<00:01:42.290> as<00:01:42.409> well<00:01:42.440> but<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:43.070> think<00:01:43.250> really<00:01:43.700> it's

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
in there as well but I think really it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.060 
in there as well but I think really it's
going<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.540> stay<00:01:44.690> true<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.290> spirit<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
going to stay true to the spirit of the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.350 
going to stay true to the spirit of the
original<00:01:46.159> game<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:46.940> you'll<00:01:47.090> have<00:01:47.240> that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
original game so you'll have that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.450 
original game so you'll have that
survival<00:01:47.899> horror<00:01:48.050> angle<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.280> kind<00:01:49.369> of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
survival horror angle it's kind of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.460 
survival horror angle it's kind of
metaphysical<00:01:50.119> angle<00:01:50.929> in<00:01:51.050> there<00:01:51.259> that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
metaphysical angle in there that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.350 
metaphysical angle in there that
expiration<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.220> station<00:01:52.640> cities<00:01:53.000> so

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
expiration of the station cities so

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.810 
expiration of the station cities so
it'll<00:01:54.140> be<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.320> real<00:01:54.710> metro<00:01:55.039> area<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.520> I

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it'll be a real metro area to do it I

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.090 
it'll be a real metro area to do it I
think<00:01:56.149> what<00:01:56.270> sir<00:01:56.570> what<00:01:57.440> we<00:01:57.530> saw<00:01:57.679> in<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.860> first

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
think what sir what we saw in the first

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.400 
think what sir what we saw in the first
game<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> AI<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.300> sometimes<00:02:00.050> behave

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
game was the the AI can sometimes behave

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.160 
game was the the AI can sometimes behave
inconsistently<00:02:01.390> or<00:02:02.390> rather<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:02.869> behave

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
inconsistently or rather it was behave

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.050 
inconsistently or rather it was behave
inconsistently<00:02:03.380> but<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.610> didn't<00:02:04.880> seem<00:02:04.970> to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
inconsistently but it didn't seem to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.940 
inconsistently but it didn't seem to
make<00:02:05.179> sense<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.600> factly<00:02:05.899> how<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.259> was<00:02:06.350> how<00:02:06.830> it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
make sense of factly how it was how it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.320 
make sense of factly how it was how it
was<00:02:07.070> explaining<00:02:07.460> now<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> lot<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.149> comes

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
was explaining now a lot of that comes

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.170 
was explaining now a lot of that comes
down<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.840> comes<00:02:09.470> down<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.800> polish<00:02:10.429> kind<00:02:11.090> of
