00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello guys welcome to this new 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:08.480
 video and I bring you a review of a 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.120
 pretty pretty special case had 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.589
 I really want to share it with you 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.900
 you will wonder why it is special if 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.520
 It is a flat cover and blue color 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.369
 It really is because it has received several 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.439
 awards several prizes because because 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.710
 this case has a very very function 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.859
 good and that is that 50% increases the signal or 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.230
 wifi ie it increases by 50% the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.570
 wifi coverage of your iphone for example 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 if you are connected to a network that 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.950
 comes with very little coverage with this 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.860
 cover and with the slider antenna that 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.350
 then we will see it increases 50% that 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.870
 signal therefore that network received 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.180
 much better in the back does not 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.040
 explains a little how this case works 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.110
 As you can see in the image, there is a 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.820
 small antenna that has excelled that what 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.830
 we will do later for is that in the case 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.720
 we have a small antenna that if the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.210
 we slide up let's say it's 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.060
 active and that makes our our 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 iphone receive 50% more designed wifi 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.200
 so let's go directly to open the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.450
 package to see what it contains 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.369
 we are including the sleeve blue 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.789
 that we had seen but also we 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.490
 includes an extra antenna in this case of 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.649
 green color as you see the case and it's 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.079
 one in this case the same blue 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.869
 color that the cover but you get another 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.509
 gift in case you want to change it in this 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.549
 green case so let's go to 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.009
 take the case and as we see ahead 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.329
 There is a small manual that later I 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.340
 I will teach and we also have the 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.289
 extra antenna that include us that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 We can change at any time if 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.119
 we like it more or if we just want 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.130
 change the manual makes us a small 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.860
 comparative and explains a bit how 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.979
 works compares them with an iphone with 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.530
 the lanter activated and without an activated antenna 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.509
 and also explains how to put 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 the sleeve on the iphone or how to change the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.280
 antenna so we go directly and 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.799
 We put the case on our iphone fits 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.390
 highlight the touch of this sleeve ie 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.880
 I do not know how to explain it but it 's a 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 plastic that is very very but really 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.620
 very nice at hand is very 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.209
 refined I do not know I liked it enough 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.620
 part of fulfilling its function well as 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.720
 then you will see that I will do a couple of tests of 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 speed is also very nice to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.760
 touch and hand so guys I've 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.830
 prepared a couple of speed tests in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.019
 the first case we are doing the des 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.849
 of speed with the cover but without the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.200
 activated antenna then you will see how it 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.090
 active really is very easy 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 it is simply to slide the antenna that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.870
 we have seen previously in these two 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.610
 first cases that we will see in this video 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.220
 I'm saying before speed with my 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.870
 wifi network but quite far from the point 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.239
 of access as I said at the beginning 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.810
 this speed test is without the antenna 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.019
 activated therefore gives us 42 of pin 3 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.359
 like 24 downhill speed and 52 off 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.400
 upload speed as I said to the 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.980
 principle this speed test is without 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.890
 the antenna activated and it gives us a result 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.640
 of 42 ping 3.24 speed of 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.040
 download and upload speed 52 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.900
 that now we slide the antenna as you see 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.290
 here in the video we just have it 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 up and it's already activated so 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.840
 now let's do a speed test 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.090
 and we'll see what comes out we do not know about 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.310
 moment 30 and ping and about 17 18 megabytes of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.120
 down 18 almost 19 about 19 megabytes of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.890
 descent 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 compared to before we got 3 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.780
 that is, it is much better and it shows 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.930
 very much very much the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.240
 difference and good of rise 5.22 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.520
 also quite more than what we had 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.190
 in the first speed test without the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.780
 antenna turned on so just now 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.550
 we can say that this works 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.710
 truth and the truth is that it improves 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.440
 very much the speed but a lot and 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.630
 it is quite noticeable so now we are going to 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.160
 do another pair of speed test but 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.970
 in this case with another wifi network that still 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.610
 is further away so firstly the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.450
 we do without the antenna activated and see 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.060
 that we get increase 106 ping and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.460
 As you can see, it is hard for you to throw and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.329
 do the test for now stay 0.2 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.519
 the download speed 0 23 at the end 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.129
 and the speed of his life seems like a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.020
 little better but it's not that there's 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:29.599
 highlight anything because it has stayed in 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.920
 025 so 023 of descent 025 of rise 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.560
 and 106 ping 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.440
 so now we go to do the test 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.170
 speed with the antenna activated from 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.660
 again so let's check if 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.450
 and working again surprises us another 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.280
 once with its operation we have 107 of 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.230
 ping but as you can see the ping test has 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.710
 gone much faster and much more fluid 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.380
 and before descending as you see it returns to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.050
 stand out much more than without the case 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.690
 As you can see we have the 4 megabytes of download 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.470
 and the upload test in this case we have 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.990
 0 05 because there is no more this network only 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.430
 has 0.5 give rise speed 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.930
 so it will not get more 0.54 so 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.690
 guys like you've seen and it's been 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.170
 proven the performance is much higher 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.030
 but much greater with the with the 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.760
 antenna placed with this case and the antenna 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.170
 activated ie that the latter network me 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.240
 it seems that it has 5 megabytes therefore 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.500
 we could not ask for much more and the 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.260
 network with which we have made both 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.480
 first tests has 50 megabytes but it is possible 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.280
 keep in mind that we were very very 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.380
 but that very far from the point of 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.639
 access so we've had in 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.099
 conclusion one is very 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.590
 good results with this case and the 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.050
 antenna activated so guys nothing more 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.389
 to say that this is all I hope that you 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.669
 have liked as you have seen the iphone 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.340
 the wifi of the iphone yields much more 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.860
 with this case and at the beginning it cost me 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.840
 I said wow this has to be very good 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.729
 because at the beginning it was like a little 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.800
 I did not believe it but seen it seen 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.689
 there is nothing to doubt there is nothing 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.569
 to put on trial or anything to discuss 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.759
 because the results say everything not 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.879
 they say it on their own so there are kids left 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.469
 I leave all the links of this company 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.180
 of this cover in the description itself 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.639
 want more information or if the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.199
 you want to buy so nothing guys this 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.389
 it's all I hope this video has you 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.819
 liked and you have enjoyed it so 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.620
 Success always liked the sign 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.939
 If you are not subscribed and we see you 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.939
 next video see you later
