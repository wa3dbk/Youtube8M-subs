next<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.170> would<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.440> talk<00:03:18.740> about<00:03:18.890> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
next I would like to talk about the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.520 
next I would like to talk about the
buttons<00:03:19.640> as<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.240> can<00:03:20.330> see<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.780> has<00:03:20.810> 13

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
buttons as you can see it has 13

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.860 
buttons as you can see it has 13
programmable<00:03:21.920> buttons<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:23.210> example<00:03:23.720> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
programmable buttons for example that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.230 
programmable buttons for example that
click<00:03:24.230> right<00:03:24.560> click<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> trap<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.180> you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
click right click and as a trap so you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.420 
click right click and as a trap so you
won't<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.900> want<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.350> edit<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.010> buttons

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
won't if you want to edit the buttons

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.830 
won't if you want to edit the buttons
you<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.150> click<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.570> edit

will<00:03:34.940> share<00:03:35.210> to<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.660> guys<00:03:35.900> where<00:03:36.410> it's<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
will share to you guys where it's a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.560 
will share to you guys where it's a
position<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.250> about<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.700> number<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.360> this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
position of about the number one on this

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.590 
position of about the number one on this
mask<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.110> also<00:03:39.920> for<00:03:40.070> example<00:03:40.670> about<00:03:41.480> the

task you want to assign to this button

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.560 
task you want to assign to this button
to<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:52.100> can<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:52.490> example<00:03:52.550> by<00:03:53.060> default<00:03:53.390> is

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
to you can for example by default is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.479 
to you can for example by default is
generate<00:03:53.990> button<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.740> can<00:03:54.920> use<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.160> for

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
generate button but you can use it for

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.880 
generate button but you can use it for
page<00:03:55.790> up<00:03:56.030> or<00:03:56.390> patient<00:03:56.810> down<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.170> as<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> truck

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
page up or patient down and as a truck

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.229 
page up or patient down and as a truck
and<00:03:58.180> also<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.360> has<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.600> fast<00:03:59.989> description<00:04:00.590> here

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and also it has a fast description here

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.699 
and also it has a fast description here
next<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.360> would<00:04:02.420> like<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.600> talk<00:04:02.840> about<00:04:03.020> the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
next I would like to talk about the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.240 
next I would like to talk about the
pointer<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:05.540> as<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.690> can<00:04:05.840> see<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.800> has<00:04:06.860> three

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
pointer so as you can see it has three

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.160 
pointer so as you can see it has three
sections<00:04:07.580> here<00:04:08.030> which<00:04:08.390> are<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.780> first<00:04:08.989> one

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
sections here which are the first one

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.520 
sections here which are the first one
will<00:04:09.350> be<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.620> DPI<00:04:09.980> sensitivity<00:04:10.790> levels<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.930> it

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
will be the DPI sensitivity levels so it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.310 
will be the DPI sensitivity levels so it
has<00:04:12.590> five<00:04:13.459> number<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.090> DPI<00:04:14.450> levels<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.260> you

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
has five number of DPI levels and you

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.849 
has five number of DPI levels and you
can<00:04:15.980> set<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.579> x<00:04:16.790> +<00:04:17.030> 1<00:04:17.180> x<00:04:17.450> is<00:04:17.630> separately<00:04:18.079> but<00:04:18.680> in

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
can set the x + 1 x is separately but in

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.920

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
excesses so if as you can see the range

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.409 
excesses so if as you can see the range
of<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.860> DPI<00:04:25.220> levels<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:25.940> from<00:04:26.390> 202<00:04:27.669> 5700<00:04:28.669> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.250 
the high-end gaming mouse for example
steelseries<00:04:52.070> would<00:04:52.580> call<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.090> as<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.660> free<00:04:53.990> move

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
and raise the drift control which also

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.490 
and raise the drift control which also
carries<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.320> same<00:04:57.500> meaning

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
carries the same meaning

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.530 
carries the same meaning
and<00:04:58.770> last<00:04:59.370> but<00:04:59.430> not<00:04:59.580> least<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.910> report<00:05:00.300> rate

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
and last but not least is a report rate

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.560

reports<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> second<00:05:04.500> but<00:05:04.920> if<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.280> want<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.760> go

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
reports the second but if you want to go

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.680

to<00:05:06.540> some<00:05:07.050> serious<00:05:07.410> gaming<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:08.130> would<00:05:09.120> advise<00:05:09.450> to

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
to some serious gaming I would advise to

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.130 
to some serious gaming I would advise to
go<00:05:09.960> for<00:05:10.350> 1,000<00:05:10.980> reports<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.460> second<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.930> you

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
go for 1,000 reports of a second but you

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.720 
go for 1,000 reports of a second but you
must<00:05:13.320> bear<00:05:13.530> in<00:05:13.650> mind<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:13.980> if<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.370> use<00:05:14.490> the

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
must bear in mind that if you use the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850 
must bear in mind that if you use the
1,000<00:05:15.510> reports<00:05:15.660> per<00:05:16.020> second<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.830> battery

1,000 reports per second the battery

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.130 
1,000 reports per second the battery
life<00:05:17.370> would<00:05:17.760> reduce<00:05:18.380> significantly<00:05:21.140> after
