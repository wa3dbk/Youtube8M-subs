00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 Today we will build a constructor 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.800
 Do you like to build a designer? 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.460
 I am very! 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.160
 So, let's begin 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 We will collect today 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.940
 FIRE MACHINE 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.620
 This is a frame, it is gray. 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.940
 First we put a cabin on it. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.460
 What color is the cabin? 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.340
 Correct, red! 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 Do you know why red? 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 Because 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 FIRE ENGINE 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 This is the body! 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 he is also red 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 Now we will add 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 service bay 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.760
 This is the door 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.980
 From the beginning, we will add a hose 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 This is an ax! 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 And this is a fire extinguisher 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 all these tools 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.820
 Firefighters use when extinguishing a fire! 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.660
 Now we will close our service bay. 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.040
 Now add windows 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.300
 they are blue 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.520
 Let's see what we have left! 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420
 Add a white bar 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 fire escape 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 Add a spotlight 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.860

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.540

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.640
 Now add the wheel 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.080
 Second wheel 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.340

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.960
