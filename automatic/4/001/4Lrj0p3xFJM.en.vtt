theorize are going to be in these games
I<00:01:49.530> believe<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.820> lot

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I believe that there's going to be a lot

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.639 
I believe that there's going to be a lot
of<00:01:51.060> mega<00:01:51.329> evolution<00:01:51.450> related<00:01:52.320> stuff

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
of mega evolution related stuff

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.219 
of mega evolution related stuff
especially<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.630> x<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.110> y

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
especially because if you got x and y

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
especially because if you got x and y
very<00:01:55.560> early<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.670> those<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.030> who<00:01:57.299> did<00:01:57.540> you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.340 
soon or not like I kind of expected them
to<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> remakes<00:03:19.820> either<00:03:20.480> next<00:03:20.959> year<00:03:21.140> or

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
to do the remakes either next year or

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.470 
to do the remakes either next year or
year<00:03:21.680> after<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.850> would<00:03:23.000> be<00:03:23.180> quite

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
year after that but that would be quite

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.750 
year after that but that would be quite
some<00:03:23.780> time<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> wait<00:03:24.620> especially<00:03:25.190> because<00:03:25.340> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
some time to wait especially because I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.940 
some time to wait especially because I
personally<00:03:26.480> did<00:03:26.690> not<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:27.080> x<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.500> y<00:03:27.590> as<00:03:27.739> much

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
personally did not like x and y as much

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.590 
personally did not like x and y as much
as<00:03:28.220> some<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.610> other<00:03:28.730> Pokemon<00:03:29.209> games<00:03:29.390> at

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
as some of the other Pokemon games at

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.270 
as some of the other Pokemon games at
played<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.049> felt<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.850> lacked<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.280> after

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
played I felt like it lacked in after

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.880 
played I felt like it lacked in after
game<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:35.540> really<00:03:36.230> really<00:03:36.350> hope<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
game and I really really hope that the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.070 
game and I really really hope that the
remakes<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.370> ruby<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:37.820> sapphire<00:03:37.880> do<00:03:38.540> not<00:03:38.780> lack

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
remakes of ruby and sapphire do not lack

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.600 
remakes of ruby and sapphire do not lack
and<00:03:39.350> after<00:03:39.560> game<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.739> hope<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.250> there's<00:03:40.400> going

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
and after game I hope that there's going
