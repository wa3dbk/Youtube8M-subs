this<00:03:15.180> thing<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.720> about<00:03:16.020> 68<00:03:16.620> miles<00:03:17.070> an<00:03:17.370> hour

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
even with these gigantic tires on it so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.150 
even with these gigantic tires on it so
it<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:21.060> about<00:03:21.180> multiplying<00:03:22.080> torque<00:03:22.590> with

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it was all about multiplying torque with

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160 
it was all about multiplying torque with
the<00:03:23.310> transmission<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.240> with<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.690> rear<00:03:24.960> end

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
and transmission and the worst fear is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.050 
and transmission and the worst fear is
mud<00:03:29.910> use<00:03:30.290> anything<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> largest<00:03:32.460> class<00:03:32.790> of

was<00:03:36.540> more<00:03:36.930> than<00:03:37.140> adequate<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.890> drive<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.670> big

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030
