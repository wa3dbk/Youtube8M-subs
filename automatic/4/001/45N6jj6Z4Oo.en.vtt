00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.180
 young justice legacy is a title that 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.860
 It is played by all young people 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.439
 favorite heroes of the series such as 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 super boy robin aqualand nightwing and 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.250
 sion and wonder smart crowd and tells us 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.840
 new chapter that happens between the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.610
 season 1 and 2 of the series of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.320
 television even comes to be 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.149
 special appearances of the popular 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.010
 Heroes of the Justice League 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.570
 include multiplayer modes for 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.760
 share the combat experience with 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.200
 these famous characters without a doubt this 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.110
 may sound promising for the faithful 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.120
 dish and comics fans but from 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.550
 the beginning we feel that the visual aspect 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.960
 sometimes it becomes obsolete to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.450
 the standards of the current consoles 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.340
 it seems that freedom factory studios 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.690
 not put enough effort into doing 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.700
 a game that was visually 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.200
 shocking just as fans expect 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.120
 of superhero video games in 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.010
 moments our visual environment presents 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.810
 pixelated scenes aspect that we 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.579
 remember how a game looked like this 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.130
 genre in a playstation 2 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.170
 the control system does not contribute 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.759
 much to a fluid experience leaving 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.189
 all the action in a simple repetition 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.659
 of buttons without rhythm without game modes 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.729
 specials or anything like that 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.859
 just use strong punches and 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.710
 weak throw objects as well as using 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.840
 Superpowers 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.330
 but in the department of superpowers 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.010
 they also fall behind compared to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.320
 other games of the same genre like the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.150
 franchise marvel ultimate alliance and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 that in almost the majority of them 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.420
 powers can be combined between 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.460
 characters creating great sequences 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.680
 action charged with strong emotion for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.390
 the players in this game are limited that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.399
 work together which causes that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 the combat dynamics become 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.170
 repetitive not to say monotonous other 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.880
 major flaw in the game is that the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.560
 detection of the blows are very 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.540
 mismatched by what you can lose 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.310
 several seconds in the battle trying 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.890
 to connect powers or to grab your 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.240
 enemies without achieving it on the other hand the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 artificial intelligence of the enemies 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.250
 and even the design of these becomes 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.899
 repetitive the only thing that is required for 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.090
 destroy them is to keep pushing 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.670
 buttons quickly and repetitively to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 through the whole game young justice 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.050
 legacy is handled at times as a rpg of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.640
 superheroes but really the only thing 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.920
 that is earned through leveling 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 they are a few special movements 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.030
 same that many times not even 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 will be very useful since in the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 Most of the time the level of play 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.790
 does not present a complexity that leads to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.579
 limit in our abilities 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.379
 they are extremely simple so it's like that 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.500
 that never show the characters 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.090
 team skills or failing their 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.010
 special powers as they have 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.840
 offered other titles of the same gender 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.760
 in online cooperative mode this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.159
 situation worsens as the second 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.049
 player will not have access to the few 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.970
 modifications that can be made to 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.069
 character which greatly limits the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.689
 game experience together about 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.030
 the host player will have access to 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.920
 these changes in the characters despite 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.109
 of everything there are aspects that are worth 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.180
 worth noting one of them is the center 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.889
 which rescues a bit the emotion in 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.629
 the battles and in the story another 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.549
 detail maybe it can be played 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.439
 with the favorite characters of the series 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.299
 and these retain their personality 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.129
 characteristic through a good 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.629
 voice acting to become the 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.939
 themselves within the comic universe 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.709
 maybe the fans of young justice are 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.359
 feel more attracted by the story that 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.239
 presents this title that by its system 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.889
 of game which does not revolutionize and much 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.290
 less proposes innovative alternatives 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.299
 within his gender what leaves him short 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 before other games of similar style 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.650
 probably the diehard fans of 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.569
 comics are in this little polished 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.730
 production just an attempt 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.840
 more for taking these superheroes to the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.840
 top of consoles
