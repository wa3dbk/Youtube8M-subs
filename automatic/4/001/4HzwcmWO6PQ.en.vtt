00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 and then guys I select are well 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.099
 welcome to another tutorial and good at 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.010
 tutorial I'll teach you how to do it 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.040
 the much faster horse minecraft 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.920
 because in the version 1.1 since 7.5 was 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.199
 added minecraft horse and now it's 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 very difficult to find the horse and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 A lot of people want to know how they are 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 and I have several tips here and how 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 find and the first tip is to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.750
 found in a flat place so much that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 if I create a flat world now you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 will see that it will be born near a mountain 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 of horse until creating here super plan 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.850
 completed and I will create 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.770
 Look here, everybody, it's a super plan. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.780
 and you can already see that what you 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.110
 more people find in the super world 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.629
 Flat is the slime either sibs baking here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.969
 and the horse because the horse it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.629
 finds in the world super plan thinks little 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.670
 also 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
 really we have here animals that are 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 find in the world super flat slime you 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.210
 not found in minecraft is very 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.850
 hard to find and in the super world 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 plan here oh a lot because in one place 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
 plan that you also think because you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 has nothing more tepedino and his vision 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 here, but look when the horse has 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 of all species here have cow 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 but you do not want to know how 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 is in the world rose flat ne 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.680
 so I'm going to teach the world how we are going 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.680
 So 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.299
 Good people, I'm here in the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 must be the same as your world there then a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.560
 common world and now I started from scratch 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.479
 right here to teach you here already has 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 sugar cane is to teach you how 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 if you find yourself on horseback then what we 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 will make people try to find 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 first a flat biome is not 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 because I really do not plan range that the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 People will find the type here. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.780
 is very hilly and in the mountains 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.899
 in a pond value look there we already have another 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.450
 biome lior aliete the wetland is the biome 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.880
 Marsh then you will not serve as well and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.299
 You go on how you walk up to 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.040
 find flat biome flat biome 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.350
 which is usually the sand 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.899
 desert and usually in the desert you do not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.330
 will find horse because in the desert 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.890
 There's no horse, then I'll find 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.200
 a biome that I do not know how much goes 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.680
 take it may take a while so I 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.530
 I will 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.629
 dana here to find a plan biome 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.319
 here and when you find a place that has 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.390
 by horse 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.579
 I'm back, good guys, I just arrived at 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 place the plan you can see I am 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.760
 more or less in this biome that has a 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.590
 lots of matinha so a lot of 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.209
 plant so usually here I was 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.769
 almost starving to death, I found a 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.159
 little he eats his meat 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.900
 So folks, it 's me I walked a lot, it's you. 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.519
 You have to be lucky to find some 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 plan then let's explore this biome 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.719
 Kim I just found to see if I 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.030
 usually find value horses 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.530
 they are close to villages too 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.159
 which can be a village that has a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.889
 close 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:53.010
 neco ok here's another biome then 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.780
 people look horse is horse is not cow 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.030
 I thought I was on horseback, but let's go 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.099
 continue here then you should probably 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.639
 have horse look at it there what that 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.709
 there 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.959
 Let me take a closer look at what I already 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.030
 I found two horses here. 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.549
 it's super easy to find a biome 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.750
 plan generally in these biomes than the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.569
 people find né 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.150
 I should have more, I do not know around here anymore. 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.810
 usually they are near the village 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.449
 it is and also emapa plan so in place 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.090
 So you seen there , there you are. 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.819
 can put the cell in it apple do not know 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.010
 you can look after and to climb it 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.419
 here but only you have what you have 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.889
 that for the cell in it for you to be able 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.239
 control him right? 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.129
 I look not me not to 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 I can not control it, I do not know 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.760
 as it does here ó he began to like and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.159
 damn it 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.439
 commanding here anyway you have to 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.449
 domestic help iraq but who only 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.009
 back through the cell is that the cell you alone 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.560
 can with one with cowhide né 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.060
 with cowhide and gets the cell in 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.769
 cell in it apple 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.049
 here is already domesticated only need to put the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.639
 to be able to control and if you 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.530
 wonder what the jungle was like in the 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.780
 horse I can teach in another 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.370

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.269
 of the horses I had found of those 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.879
 horses that appear an ass here that I 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.459
 had found a village also looks 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.930
 there is a rabbit too 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.840
 It is near the village 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.389
 look here oh always flat map so me 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.760
