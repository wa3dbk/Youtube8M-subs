00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 in the arma of orbizs got look not under 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 exchanged 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.710
 armor pick up taken here albasty 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 pressure center fell out and shook 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.030

 pick up in an hour will take everything all beat 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.320
 this is a draw after five cards friends first 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 the set becomes interesting 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.399
 Europe warm themselves know 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 past their fights on and said they went to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.110
 an attack of the volume pr is not in vain after all 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 the loss is not for nothing that they did not attack 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.530
 risked they did not attack last 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300
 map they 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.399
 I poured something on it, they still 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.470
 felt confident on the map mines 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.450
 and that means we will have additional 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.280
 cards so we have the first set 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 delayed and our pause 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.480
 for now there will also be a little bit later 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.670
 but honestly well, I still want a number on it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 I want to see the sandy river 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.510
 it would be such a wonderful 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.890
 opportunity in rarely appears so similar 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.660
 talk trying to leave the river well 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.209
 First, he's here with. 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.069

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.080
 gang for him here leaving writing you can 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.360
 there is no noise 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.070
 batting which remains with us one actor 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.470
 on t1 here of course nothing does everything 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.959
 it becomes 11 almost right now 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.959
 he will be after five course cards could 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.600
 to equalize the first set and we will go 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.190
 1 additional card and this is the card 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.819
 which is played under the first number a 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.890

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.630
 in principle on himmedsdorf and then if 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.370
 that mines then ruinberg but i 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.989
 confused probably Khimki will be started 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.610
 ruinberg play before the cruiser there for sure 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.799

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.019
 df and here on the first map and on Khimki 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.970
