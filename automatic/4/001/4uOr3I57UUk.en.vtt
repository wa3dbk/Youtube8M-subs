00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
highlights for me on the iPhone are the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.230 
highlights for me on the iPhone are the
striking<00:04:23.940> colors<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:25.440> love<00:04:25.650> this

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
striking colors I really do love this

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.300 
striking colors I really do love this
green<00:04:26.660> color<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.199> haven't<00:04:27.800> seen<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.160> other

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
green color I haven't seen the other

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.309 
green color I haven't seen the other
colors<00:04:28.699> actually<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.419> person<00:04:29.870> yet<00:04:30.050> but<00:04:30.110> I

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
colors actually in person yet but I

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.540 
colors actually in person yet but I
would<00:04:30.440> imagine<00:04:30.530> they're<00:04:30.949> equally<00:04:31.400> as

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
would imagine they're equally as

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.790 
would imagine they're equally as
pleasing<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.060> look<00:04:32.090> at<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.599> also<00:04:33.259> think<00:04:33.590> the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
pleasing to look at I also think the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.469 
pleasing to look at I also think the
camera<00:04:34.130> is<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.250> big<00:04:34.460> highlight<00:04:34.819> as<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.180> was<00:04:35.300> with

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
camera is a big highlight as it was with

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.629 
camera is a big highlight as it was with
the<00:04:35.599> previous<00:04:36.020> generation<00:04:36.050> iPhone<00:04:37.009> I<00:04:37.190> think

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
the previous generation iPhone I think

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.700 
the previous generation iPhone I think
Apple<00:04:37.759> just<00:04:38.060> do<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.449> camera<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.380> well<00:04:39.620> it

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
Apple just do the camera so so well it

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.529 
Apple just do the camera so so well it
might<00:04:39.919> not<00:04:39.949> be<00:04:40.340> up<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.699> megapixel<00:04:41.360> count

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
might not be up to the megapixel count

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.600 
might not be up to the megapixel count
of<00:04:41.780> some<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:41.990> these<00:04:42.080> latest<00:04:42.530> offerings<00:04:42.949> but<00:04:43.550> I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
of some of these latest offerings but I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.640 
of some of these latest offerings but I
think<00:04:43.849> 8<00:04:43.970> megapixels<00:04:44.599> is<00:04:44.720> plenty<00:04:45.229> enough<00:04:45.349> and

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
think 8 megapixels is plenty enough and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.710 
think 8 megapixels is plenty enough and
it<00:04:45.710> does<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.889> really<00:04:45.979> good<00:04:46.580> job<00:04:46.819> with<00:04:47.419> the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
it does a really good job with the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.870 
it does a really good job with the
actual<00:04:48.110> photos<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.830> videos<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.340> produces

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
actual photos and videos it produces

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.969 
actual photos and videos it produces
I've<00:04:50.630> also<00:04:50.810> been<00:04:51.080> really<00:04:51.560> pleased<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:51.889> the

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
I've also been really pleased to the

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.070 
I've also been really pleased to the
battery<00:04:52.370> life<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.819> overall<00:04:53.780> it's<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:53.930> been

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
battery life and overall it's just been

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.110 
battery life and overall it's just been
a<00:04:54.289> pleasure<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.830> use<00:04:55.069> I<00:04:55.340> have<00:04:55.880> my<00:04:56.060> doubts

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
a pleasure to use I have my doubts

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.510 
a pleasure to use I have my doubts
initially<00:04:56.870> about<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.229> plastic<00:04:57.770> back<00:04:57.979> but

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
initially about the plastic back but

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.700 
initially about the plastic back but
it's<00:04:58.669> absolutely<00:04:59.300> fine<00:04:59.539> I<00:04:59.810> think<00:05:00.169> if<00:05:00.409> you<00:05:00.530> want

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it's absolutely fine I think if you want

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.770 
it's absolutely fine I think if you want
an<00:05:00.800> alternative<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.669> flagship<00:05:02.360> iPhone

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
an alternative to that flagship iPhone

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.839 
an alternative to that flagship iPhone
5s<00:05:03.349> then<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.710> should<00:05:03.889> really<00:05:04.190> consider<00:05:04.400> this

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
5s then you should really consider this

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.020 
5s then you should really consider this
it<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> great<00:05:06.650> smartphone<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.759> I<00:05:07.819> think

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
it is a great smartphone and I think

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.029 
it is a great smartphone and I think
apples<00:05:08.419> done<00:05:08.659> wise<00:05:09.020> move<00:05:09.319> by<00:05:09.380> introducing

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
apples done wise move by introducing

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.890 
apples done wise move by introducing
multiple<00:05:10.639> colors<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.060> will<00:05:11.150> appeal<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.509> a<00:05:11.659> lot

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
multiple colors it will appeal to a lot

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.100 
multiple colors it will appeal to a lot
more<00:05:11.930> people<00:05:12.259> than<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.310> iPhone<00:05:13.880> 5s<00:05:13.909> and<00:05:14.780> I

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
more people than the iPhone 5s and I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.930 
more people than the iPhone 5s and I
think<00:05:15.380> eventually<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:16.490> will<00:05:16.669> probably

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
think eventually it will probably

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.200 
think eventually it will probably
outsell<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.960> iPhone<00:05:18.349> 5s<00:05:18.830> as<00:05:19.009> well<00:05:19.159> now<00:05:20.030> one

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
outsell the iPhone 5s as well now one

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.820 
outsell the iPhone 5s as well now one
thing<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.509> will<00:05:20.720> mention<00:05:20.750> before<00:05:21.470> I<00:05:21.500> close<00:05:21.800> this

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
thing I will mention before I close this

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.850 
thing I will mention before I close this
video<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.550> about<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.479> capacity<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:24.349> little<00:05:24.740> bit
