00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.769
 point around 300 coins and see me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 sell for much more than I do them 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 because otherwise it is not acting 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.949
 at least this riviÃ¨re picked up 54 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 the floor and whatever you know 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 probably what I'm going to do each 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.399
 case 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
 first wise game i 'm just going in the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.190
 division I have no idea what the vision 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 ma 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 x when the team is against a family 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
 of course with the star beach in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 pointed and those LEDs immediately see how well 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.320
 who is and why i still really like you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 A fantastic player can too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 with someone he 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 raped the room defense so authority 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.910
 can't say 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 hi link that planet puteweg he 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 sprinted by and maybe the good 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.579
 with his left that is all just 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 the goodness of strips and and this cabbage 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 is really very beautiful for me really i swear 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 I have never had such a good corn market 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.750
 ultimate team for all that preparation 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.670
 work of mine not that he made a mistake 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 makes or solid defense no it went 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.299
 totally to my credit that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 think that always finds beautiful you know 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.640
 then I feel really good when I have them 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.830
 target and orange too 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 exaggerated because your oh wait oh oh me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 can also make mistakes because studying 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 boy all my god yes and jack or was i 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.600
 an it they peeled i think i'm on this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.189
 moment was really a week ago or 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.680
 do not like injustice so me 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.520
 I think just give him a grain 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 back 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.689
 I swear this was okay this one 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.250
 delivery I want you by the way 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.540
 apologize that it is not so 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.070
 special delivery and that we 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.799
 already a week ago that i was rotary 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 I uploaded about class but I think so 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.159
 I act more now that you will soon 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 Already now a beginning also see my trade 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 skills saw that that is time 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 it got there for me anyway 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.259
 wanted to say sorry seems like a breeding 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 upload because that's how rotary antiques go 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.159
 not on schiphol something going a little more 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.049
 actually upload red oreo but I have 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.549
 from her time during the week especially that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.320
 is so I 'm hungry for times 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.700
 movements are busy with school and work 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.380
 and I know it all so that says 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 which the annoying to be able to do much 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
 upload will try 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 not one move I deliberately have one 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
 wifi router elsewhere tell everyone to you 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
 gives boost or so it is equally 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.110
 a nice ovation from castamere because she 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.120
 the goal was empty and the ball that two 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.470
 once it was the most thorough touch 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.670
 was not real 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 I thought it was pretty nice 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.440
 personally in this case the 4 is 2 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.450
 so you know that only the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.709
 five 2 can still come or the four three 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 of course but r52 goes natural 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.340
 do not come out particularly beautiful 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 the volley is smooth with empty the more beautiful 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 enclosed by morata not to friend them 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.019
 me my fantastic skills just me 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.989
 that it 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.239
 Games pastis is unrealistic in that 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.350
 cases also just say you can 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.580
 I always had to twitter 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.140
 you looked over and could fietsie 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.049
 this website but i have nowadays 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
 Just now everyone that serious 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.160
 right i am good guy wit it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.569
 fly loose and fresh times for when you 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.569
 he likes tweet all that briefly 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.130
 me I x 40 watts often I now have two 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.870
 a thousand subscribers or from kokoon that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.480
 seriously someone a fast white for my 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.760
 I am amazed that everyone is right 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.110
 case this of thillo 6 for facts 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.030
 coach i bought it i do one 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.370
 ticket for 150 ever and then it is 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.470
 800 in total cost me that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 and then sell for 2000 and then you know 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.390
 then i have good profit in your case 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.150
 who play in the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 what is this volume that cup again the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.420
 league bbva cup or something and that cup is like that 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.040
 amateurish in my opinion because you 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.370
 must be one 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.140
 a play of madrid or play of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.700
 use Warsaw so I am thinking 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.620
 what that season I didn't know he did 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.150
 but the thinking orders really such a cunt for 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.160
 me you know I am very real 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.070
 really super coincidental and really super chill 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.570
 yes you can is a one play three i will 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.550
 once against a team 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.230
 and who does has just got stuck 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.610
 material is something noble backup software 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.620
 just brazilian team that i also like 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.430
 you no you are good about that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.650
 thought 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.120
 at least risk still plays a role 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.560
 what that rule just abolished 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.180
 I said that before and I told him 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.700
 lessons followed here comes with esko 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.650
 mode and pedro address nothing you just know 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.000
 their buttocks at the peak you really want something 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.560
 have you been prorail 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.950
 So there see about it link their 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.970
 terra period suit that that strikes nowhere 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.000
 on 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.340
 their wheat ac milan so really like that of 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.260
 of this idea and we think of you 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.190
 bert thoughts huntelaar one or me 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.650
 I remind you of van of the speed of 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.560
 of the often cut seals and and of is 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.640
 Troy that may still be on men like 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.820
 I can 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.470
 huntelaar in case i really love the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.710
 take my order according to my randomized 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.720
 me when of moritz and that makes and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.200
 happy goal and this goal was up 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.300
 himself 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.160
 soft reasonable to the fact until 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.479
 I shoot a prototype and I shoot it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.640
 with belts goal a shoot 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.680
 so bad and so lucky I had this one 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.140
 west i got lucky this game 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.330
 thing is still not too good that and 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.610
 I know that and I wasn't huge either 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.560
 good or so but I still play away and 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.810
 keep you hear no music oh how come 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.250
 it was that that music update x it became 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.000
 totally crazy about the previous episode 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.290
 especially those 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.970
 people but that song looks like that right away 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.770
 just live more shots or than me 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.600
 that that happens just ebbl 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.640
 if you are yes if you are lucky 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.410
 like me this really was such a wisdom that 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.810
 we were both just as good 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.000
 and you know that then winter 140 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.980
 because he tells you hey come here 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.530
 You win this match 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.000
 and dsd selexyz squirting that right 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.730
 bronze is and so how does that arabie 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.780
 leading is what it is pretty weird in it 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.610
 lose each of this match 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.020
 why do you say he already had the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.400
 suspense through it excites me 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.660
 actually not because i love this one 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.900
 competition was but you really became me 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.610
 No chance of living and I am two behind 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.200
 then I will come back to two one 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.430
 you are going to see it as a great goaltje 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.290
 I say just crank 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.250
 recover and tick corpse gathering 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.300
 my benzema 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.220
 but it won't come further than that 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.480
 like your only shot for me from the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.080
 whole game so bad i was yes that 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.510
 is so 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.160
 i i i want by the way this is really such 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.140
 and avoid it already viewed to the type 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.510
 by the way, I swear I want you there 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.120

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.090
 sense of that standard 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.560
