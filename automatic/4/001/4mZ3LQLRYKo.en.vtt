00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.830
 however, this model suppose 2015 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.789
 Driving model 2015 are lightweight 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 made changes in them from what 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.609
 ort even show like the previous model 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.730
 as with this model fast 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:40.739
 we can change that I take out 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 take the screen around me 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.640
 can also see that I know what 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 I do 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.320
 a license plate and brother we have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.820
 two cars with twigs time with two 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.360
 different features all over 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 normal 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.650
 but I want to get on a vehicle 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 Asked contracts should be so 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.260
 a car the license plate pair does not have to be 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.530
 seal or so that they too exactly 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.820
 be that a country vehicle casual 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 and bring it to me now 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.810
 Half way around later, these moved though 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.540
 Processing is a spare take care of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.130
 and here the others sit because of the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.130
 get a little bit out of winkmann 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 pushed in 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.110
 if I am with the other vehicle now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 the rear carrier CMX mark as well 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.590
 put out again we go the other one 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.830
 mark then you can also the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.950
 practice cards so come to one 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.460
 We're back again 2015 model what 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.890
 has changed as do has thought 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.140
 over or to many customers 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.060
 said I 'm not going to bike 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.830
 on the bike rear carrier because this 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.039
 attachment if the are too short 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.230
 So people like it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.239
 tall lady in the long just something 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.329
 larger ones may be bigger too 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.510
 Bandwidth then I get the 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:26.450
 old fortification streaming problems because 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.359
 they usually are not enough for you 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.540
 Now more I try it once to 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:40.040
 here sets a new point of reference 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.069
 is the approximate say 5 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 centimeters about length and that helps 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.489
 the German 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.010
 the rationing here is here 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.189
 ratinger has also been changed so that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.579
 these volumes down and after to 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.530
 they are being steered away 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.269
 with migrants without but really nice 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.169
 clean under the bike rear carrier 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.750
 so that there are no problems 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:12.760
 what else do we have as we have longer ones 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:18.560
 fixing bender improves the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 Final ride wide still 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.390
 All representatives without problems we have 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.940
 the lock continues to do so 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:36.110
 to fold down and now that comes 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 The next new drivers keep the ride 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.330
 keep are changed 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.000
 you can now assemble them better and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.800
 dismantle 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.400
 that is clear and much better me 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:57.350
 Show that it is an old claw 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.090
 from the predecessor that the gag nut and 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.600
 that is the claw in itself the little ones 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.680
 themselves go very far at 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.500
 predecessor as well as successor 2015 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.410
 the predecessor claw , however, has here 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.930
 in there a gumming this gumming 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.030
 is for the protection of the frame tube 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.410
 from the bike but we have the outside 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.180
 we have no protection and in here 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.720
 we also have no protection 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.660
 that's what she looks like then she would get together 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.490
 be pressed 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.950
 If you put that on , she goes to sr 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.850
 keep it open as it always does 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.850
 to close again 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.050
 So keep that in mind 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.240
 the new vehicle hall is at the gag 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.430
 was moderately spies and that all three 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.430
 old small hope big 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.150
 that's what the new one looks like 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.020
 improves that you better educate here 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.640
 can and squeeze so can 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.830
 open and close easily 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.650
 one knows less the fingers the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.230
 Claw itself is inside too 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.080
 accumulated to protect the bike 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:35.020
 she's gummed up here on the edges and 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:40.630
 she is completely gummed around the outside 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.770
 both next to each other 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.150
 Now I'm in front of the camera I know 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.410
 not at all that right or left on 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:53.030
 definitely this here is the old and 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:06:02.650
 this one is still different 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:08.030
 you clearly ok places all core areas 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.970
 lockable next to wonder these three 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.300
 piece changed does not follow me with it 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.920
 gets damaged in the bike frame or 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.550
 do differently 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:24.720
 a card against that too fast 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:29.560
 city ​​field longer fortification bender 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.090
 go to the cookie on the wheel 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.430
 was on the ring already that are the 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.270
 two notable changes the 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.190
 were executed at death the 2 respects 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.840
 he stands on our other video that stands 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.090
 for a long time on youtube on the list 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.860
 you can do that accordingly 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.830
 also purchase that is something 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.570
 more extensive and keep just the 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.200
 Change the fan part of the underworld 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.120
 occiput 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.130
 In that sense, hope heaven is 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.020
 could help and say of course 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.020
 also as always you change
