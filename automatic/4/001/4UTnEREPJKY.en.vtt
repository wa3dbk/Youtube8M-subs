00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370

oil-free<00:01:06.979> one<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.909> moisturizer

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060

don't<00:01:11.670> love<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.350> sometimes<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
don't love it just because sometimes I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
because I don't have too much to cover

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.390 
because I don't have too much to cover
but<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.840> feel<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:35.470> like<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.950> medium

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
but I feel like it's like just a medium

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.699 
but I feel like it's like just a medium
coverage<00:03:36.790> foundation<00:03:37.030> my<00:03:37.780> redness<00:03:38.109> does<00:03:38.410> tend

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
coverage foundation my redness does tend

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.830 
coverage foundation my redness does tend
to<00:03:38.829> peak<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.400> little<00:03:39.670> bit<00:03:39.850> at<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.150> end<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
to peak a little bit at the end of the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.720 
to peak a little bit at the end of the
day<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.530> nothing<00:03:41.859> major<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.190> I'm<00:03:42.519> like

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
day but it's nothing major and I'm like

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.819 
day but it's nothing major and I'm like
halfway<00:03:42.940> through<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.840> i've<00:03:44.440> been<00:03:44.680> using

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
halfway through it and i've been using

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.250 
halfway through it and i've been using
it<00:03:45.100> for<00:03:45.130> almost<00:03:45.549> two<00:03:45.910> months<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.870> feel<00:03:47.109> like

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
it for almost two months so I feel like

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.340 
it for almost two months so I feel like
maybe<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.769> might<00:03:47.890> not<00:03:48.070> last<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.549> long<00:03:48.760> but

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
maybe it might not last that long but

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.770 
maybe it might not last that long but
it's<00:03:50.350> fine<00:03:50.680> because<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.790> used<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.329> use<00:03:52.510> the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's fine because I used to use the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.930 
it's fine because I used to use the
smashbox<00:03:53.350> BB<00:03:53.709> cream<00:03:53.920> which<00:03:54.130> was<00:03:54.340> like<00:03:54.519> 40

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
smashbox BB cream which was like 40

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.780 
smashbox BB cream which was like 40
bucks<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:56.859> definitely<00:03:57.100> like<00:03:57.579> a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
bucks and this is definitely like a

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.360 
bucks and this is definitely like a
better<00:03:58.450> deal<00:03:58.570> so<00:03:59.109> people<00:03:59.470> say<00:03:59.769> that<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.190> can

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
better deal so people say that you can

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.699 
better deal so people say that you can
apply<00:04:00.579> this<00:04:00.670> with<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.209> brush<00:04:01.660> but<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.230> find<00:04:02.530> that

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
apply this with a brush but I find that

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.099 
apply this with a brush but I find that
with<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:02.980> regular<00:04:03.519> foundation<00:04:03.820> brush<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.810> works

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
with a regular foundation brush it works

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.210 
with a regular foundation brush it works
perfectly<00:04:05.560> fine<00:04:05.859> but<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.519> only<00:04:06.670> thing

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
perfectly fine but the only thing

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.160 
perfectly fine but the only thing
I<00:04:07.280> think<00:04:07.670> with<00:04:07.850> your<00:04:07.970> finger<00:04:08.300> she<00:04:08.570> just<00:04:08.780> used<00:04:09.050> a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
I think with your finger she just used a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.580 
I think with your finger she just used a
lot<00:04:09.320> less<00:04:09.620> product<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:11.080> that's<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
lot less product and that's like the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.250 
lot less product and that's like the
only<00:04:12.620> difference<00:04:13.220> i<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.760> see<00:04:14.060> from<00:04:14.690> using<00:04:15.140> a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
only difference i can see from using a

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.530 
only difference i can see from using a
brush<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.740> my<00:04:15.980> fingers<00:04:16.340> sometimes<00:04:17.269> i<00:04:17.450> get

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
brush and my fingers sometimes i get

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.840 
brush and my fingers sometimes i get
stuck<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.260> product<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.010> it's<00:04:19.549> just<00:04:19.790> really

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
stuck on a product and it's just really

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.910 
stuck on a product and it's just really
hard<00:04:20.209> for<00:04:20.299> me<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.720> let<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.900> go<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.680> think

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
hard for me to let it go and I think

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.230 
hard for me to let it go and I think
this<00:04:22.040> foundation<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.640> like<00:04:22.850> one<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.030> those

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
this foundation is like one of those

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.630 
this foundation is like one of those
things<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.260> concealer<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.980> use<00:04:25.400> right

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
things so the concealer that I use right

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.360 
things so the concealer that I use right
now<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.150> Revlon<00:04:26.570> Colorstay<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.100> color

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
now is the Revlon Colorstay in the color

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.520 
now is the Revlon Colorstay in the color
light<00:04:28.670> medium<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.960> try<00:04:30.140> this<00:04:30.200> without

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
light medium I have to try this without

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530 
light medium I have to try this without
foundation<00:04:30.920> and<00:04:31.520> powder<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.270> works

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
foundation and powder and it works

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.900 
foundation and powder and it works
perfectly<00:04:32.780> fine<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.590> does<00:04:34.160> stay<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.580> all<00:04:34.850> day

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
perfectly fine it does stay on all day

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.150 
perfectly fine it does stay on all day
for<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.750> coverage<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.350> would<00:04:36.590> say<00:04:36.770> it's<00:04:36.920> also

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
for the coverage I would say it's also

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.460 
for the coverage I would say it's also
like<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> medium<00:04:38.120> coverage<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.870> definitely

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
like a medium coverage it definitely

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.620 
like a medium coverage it definitely
covers<00:04:39.920> up<00:04:40.100> what<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:40.460> needed<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:41.090> but<00:04:41.450> because

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
covers up what I needed to but because

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.710 
covers up what I needed to but because
it's<00:04:42.050> like<00:04:42.230> a<00:04:42.260> liquid<00:04:42.850> formula<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:44.180> just<00:04:44.480> it's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
it's like a liquid formula it just it's

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.720 
it's like a liquid formula it just it's
don't<00:04:44.930> full<00:04:45.230> coverage<00:04:45.590> what<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> recommend<00:04:46.430> it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
don't full coverage what I recommend it

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.180 
don't full coverage what I recommend it
yes<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.420> like<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:47.990> how<00:04:48.230> my<00:04:48.560> skin<00:04:48.920> looks

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
deep into this pot I just tend to start

deep into this pot I just tend to start
on<00:05:43.400> my<00:05:43.910> chin<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:48.560> course<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.010> want<00:05:49.190> to
