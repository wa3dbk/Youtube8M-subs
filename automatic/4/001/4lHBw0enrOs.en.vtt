 or if you have shown that the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 version and now here 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 Look at all these three files 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 please people from here 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.110
 that's important because the versions 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 also play a role in the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 come then god is here again 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 It goes down to the crime scene and last 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 tournament under as I said drauflegen the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.739
 You know the whole world then 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 you supported best on your 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 desktop or whatever you go into 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 your minecraft navis here then in 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.790
 the folder as I said you should yes 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 if they did not agree 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 the regret that has been said 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.520
 that's right and then go into minecraft 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.080
 file and important luck plays here 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.590
 away with it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.759

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.920
 Parties also downloaded here again 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.270
 that means forge takes all fortune and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.680
 pull in over here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.869

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.850
