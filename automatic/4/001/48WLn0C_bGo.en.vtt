in my opinion the best USB microphone on

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
in my opinion the best USB microphone on
the<00:00:38.310> market<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:44.240> what<00:00:45.240> you'll<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.990> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the market now what you'll need to do is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.310 
the market now what you'll need to do is
go<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.070> keyboard<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.510> computer<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
go from the keyboard to the computer and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.940 
go from the keyboard to the computer and
convert<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.310> from<00:00:50.520> quarter-inch<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.450> USB<00:00:51.950> so

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
convert it from quarter-inch to USB so

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.500 
convert it from quarter-inch to USB so
what<00:00:53.220> I<00:00:53.250> did<00:00:53.400> was<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.340> quarter-inch

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
what I did was I got a quarter-inch
