I think that our relationships with

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.800 
I think that our relationships with
other<00:00:02.100> beings<00:00:02.280> can<00:00:02.760> enrich<00:00:03.030> us<00:00:03.240> as<00:00:03.419> human

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
other beings can enrich us as human

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.680 
other beings can enrich us as human
beings<00:00:06.109> but<00:00:07.109> then<00:00:07.290> when<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.560> see<00:00:08.480> how<00:00:09.480> live

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690

and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> happen<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> veal

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and I happen to know there was a veal

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.470

bar<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.230> too<00:00:49.260> far<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:49.739> where<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.190> were

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
bar not too far from where we were

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
bar not too far from where we were

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
convening and I told her that I said

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.299 
convening and I told her that I said
would<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:54.449> yourself<00:00:55.309> she

said<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:57.710> but<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.770> convinced<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.579> somehow

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
said no but I convinced there somehow

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
said no but I convinced there somehow
and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> next<00:01:00.690> day<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:01.020> went<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:02.340> was

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and the next day we went and what was

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
and the next day we went and what was
there<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.300> par<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> course<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
there it was just par for the course it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
there it was just par for the course it
wasn't<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.769> particularly<00:01:05.159> egregious<00:01:05.640> example

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
wasn't a particularly egregious example

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
wasn't a particularly egregious example
of<00:01:06.600> veal<00:01:06.960> production<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> way<00:01:08.070> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
of veal production it was the way it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
of veal production it was the way it's
done<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:09.030> rural<00:01:09.659> Pennsylvania<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> barn

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
done in rural Pennsylvania it was a barn

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
done in rural Pennsylvania it was a barn
and<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.150> probably<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.840> big<00:01:13.020> as

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and and it was probably about as big as

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.950 
and and it was probably about as big as
this<00:01:13.229> room<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.210> there<00:01:15.210> were<00:01:15.330> individual

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this room and there were individual

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.760 
this room and there were individual
stalls<00:01:16.700> where<00:01:17.700> each<00:01:17.820> calf<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.659> chained<00:01:19.560> at

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
stalls where each calf was chained at

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
stalls where each calf was chained at
the<00:01:19.799> neck<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.390> their<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.600> walls<00:01:21.869> between

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the neck and their little walls between

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
the neck and their little walls between
them<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.290> Cavs<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.490> chains<00:01:26.820> were<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.330> short

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
them the Cavs the chains were so short

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
them the Cavs the chains were so short
that<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.920> animal<00:01:29.310> could<00:01:29.460> hardly<00:01:29.729> move<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.210> all

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that the animal could hardly move at all

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.469 
that the animal could hardly move at all
they<00:01:30.990> couldn't<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> single<00:01:31.650> step<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
they couldn't take a single step and

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.609 
they couldn't take a single step and
furthermore<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> couldn't<00:01:33.990> even<00:01:34.200> lay<00:01:34.350> down

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
furthermore it couldn't even lay down

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.789 
furthermore it couldn't even lay down
because<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> chain<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.360> headed<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.930> standing

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
because the chain was headed up standing

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
because the chain was headed up standing
and<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> couldn't<00:01:38.400> lay<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.759> sitting<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and it couldn't lay down sitting in to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
and it couldn't lay down sitting in to
its<00:01:40.020> normal<00:01:40.170> sleeping<00:01:40.829> position<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
its normal sleeping position so that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.810 
its normal sleeping position so that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
as an example because of the fact that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.910 
as an example because of the fact that
that<00:03:30.790> here<00:03:31.120> was<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.270> person<00:03:31.630> who<00:03:31.660> clearly<00:03:32.530> was

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that here was a person who clearly was

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.160 
that here was a person who clearly was
not<00:03:32.950> vegetarian<00:03:33.880> oriented<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.959> any<00:03:35.890> way<00:03:36.130> and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
not vegetarian oriented in any way and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.050 
not vegetarian oriented in any way and
yet<00:03:38.170> even<00:03:38.350> she<00:03:38.709> when<00:03:38.890> she<00:03:38.920> saw<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.640> when<00:03:39.940> she

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
yet even she when she saw it when she

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.570 
yet even she when she saw it when she
was<00:03:40.180> face<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.570> face<00:03:40.600> with<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.170> i<00:03:45.160> think

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
was face to face with it and i think

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.550 
was face to face with it and i think
that<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.060> industry<00:03:46.360> doesn't<00:03:46.750> want<00:03:47.140> people<00:03:47.500> to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
that the industry doesn't want people to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.130 
that the industry doesn't want people to
have<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.890> kind<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.220> an<00:03:48.340> experience<00:03:49.110> when<00:03:50.110> i
