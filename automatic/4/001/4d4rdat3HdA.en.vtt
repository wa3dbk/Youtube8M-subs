00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.039 

they<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.670> care<00:01:38.909> take<00:01:39.479> care<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> all

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
and this beautiful television has Putin
like<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> said<00:01:57.210> before<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.290> sorts<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
like I said before in all sorts of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.840 
like I said before in all sorts of
situations

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
situations

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
situations
I<00:02:00.079> remember<00:02:01.079> being<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.409> scared<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I remember being very scared to it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990 
I remember being very scared to it
because<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.270> Icelandic<00:02:04.229> poet<00:02:04.680> told<00:02:05.070> me<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because an Icelandic poet told me that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.969 
because an Icelandic poet told me that
not<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.289> cinema<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.440> thing<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
not like in cinema was the thing that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.570 
not like in cinema was the thing that
that<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.580> throws<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.900> picture<00:02:13.530> from<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that the throws the picture from it it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.020 
that the throws the picture from it it
just<00:02:15.300> sends<00:02:15.720> lights<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.769> screen<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.730> but

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
just sends lights on the screen but but

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.080 
just sends lights on the screen but but
this<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.300> different<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.160> millions<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
this is different this is a millions and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.259
