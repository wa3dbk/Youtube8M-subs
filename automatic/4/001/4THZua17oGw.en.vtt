00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.390
 just to say two things 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.260
 physical conditions then the conditions 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.770
 as you saw during the match col 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 catania and suffered a blunt trauma that 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.840
 as a consequence all this trauma took place 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 an important hematoma is developed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 primacy but at thigh level 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.930
 left which has been well highlighted 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.750
 even with the instrumental investigations here it is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.910
 has been submitted in the specific case the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 MRI scan 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.949
 right now we're doing the treatment 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.290
 is doing some physiotherapy 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.650
 is a phase in the rehabilitation phase e 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.629
 I would say that it was an important trauma 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.970
 one of the many traumas also suffered in the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 last is the last game but not only 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.680
 even in the previous games it was 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.729
 a little soccer-like 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 massacred and just now you are 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.180
 re-educating and navigating on sight 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 let's take a look at what those are 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 day and day conditions then 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.270
 also from a prognostic point of view 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.050
 let's see let's see June day 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.060
 then to evaluate the assumptions on there 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.680
 when they repeat to enter 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.920
 day by day or according to yours 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 clinical and instrumental conditions of the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.510
 investigations that will be submitted to this 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.100
 since he had a patch 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.490
 on the knee it had indeed lasted chickpea 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.040
 we keep the fruit of half a gram of a 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.930
 yet another drama that has suffered as 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.920
 those you love print them well 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.680
 as I said before the po comes 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.050
 targeted and therefore therefore 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.760
 honestly a little must be must 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 be ready medium and now 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.900
 more protected he said from this 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.840
 point of view of the heritage but it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 knee that never had the trauma 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 sprained ankle if this was it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.260
 something born already old 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 and then now bruised to the level of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.380
 cross 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.070
 so we don't miss anything 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.950
 but we and I will sail again navigate 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.709
 on sight and we see we evaluate day by day 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.270
 day also because I repeat he is a boy 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.190
 that appliances potential as of 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.000
 we see we do not set limits to the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.709
 providence 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.209
 despite being aware of the situation and 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.860
 of the importance of the immediately sonorous trauma 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.860
 this is surely yes
