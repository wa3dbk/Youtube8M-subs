alright<00:01:04.280> let's<00:01:04.729> get<00:01:05.149> on<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.420> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.820 

I'm<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.360> split<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.619> whole

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
I'm just gonna do split up the whole

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm just gonna do split up the whole
solo<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.820> four<00:01:45.210> parts<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.869> play

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
solo into about four parts and then play

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.650 
solo into about four parts and then play
them<00:01:46.259> each<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.640> maybe<00:01:48.390> if

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
them each one at a time and maybe if

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.630 
them each one at a time and maybe if
there's<00:01:48.869> something<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> explain<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:50.100> I'll

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
there's something to explain there I'll

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.940 
there's something to explain there I'll
do<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.330> mostly<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.080> think<00:01:52.140> having<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
do that but mostly I think having it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
do that but mostly I think having it
slowed<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.700> should<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:54.000> fairly<00:01:54.350> easy<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
slowed down it should be fairly easy to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.270 
slowed down it should be fairly easy to
follow

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
follow

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
follow
maybe<00:01:56.759> okay<00:01:57.860> anyways<00:01:59.300> so<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> first<00:02:00.600> part<00:02:00.840> run

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
maybe okay anyways so the first part run

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
maybe okay anyways so the first part run
up<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> neck<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:03.020> there's<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.580> stuff<00:02:05.580> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
up the neck and there's some stuff and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
up the neck and there's some stuff and
some<00:02:06.000> flutters<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
some flutters that I do with the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
some flutters that I do with the
floating<00:02:08.880> bridge<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.959> bridges<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.500> easier

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
floating bridge some bridges it's easier

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
floating bridge some bridges it's easier
to<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> flutter<00:02:11.489> sound<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.150> something

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to get the flutter sound and something

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.490 
to get the flutter sound and something
to<00:02:12.630> kind<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.350> deal<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:15.500> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
to kind of just have to deal with you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.979 
to kind of just have to deal with you
know<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.920> having<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.910> Bendis<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.720> stuff

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
know just having the Bendis and stuff

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.170 
know just having the Bendis and stuff
like<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.680> recorded<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.430> song<00:02:20.670> using<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
like that I recorded this song using a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.220 
like that I recorded this song using a
gem<00:02:21.390> seven<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.140> has<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.769> edge<00:02:23.610> zero<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.959> edge

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
gem seven which has a edge zero now edge

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.280 
gem seven which has a edge zero now edge
Pro<00:02:25.820> bridge<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.420> RG<00:02:27.780> has<00:02:28.019> an<00:02:28.170> edge

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
Pro bridge on it and this RG has an edge

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.430 
Pro bridge on it and this RG has an edge
zero<00:02:28.620> two<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:30.450> find<00:02:30.720> there's<00:02:30.959> totally<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
zero two and I find there's totally a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
zero two and I find there's totally a
different<00:02:31.590> amount<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.190> flutter<00:02:32.700> action<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> be

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
different amount of flutter action to be

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.420 
different amount of flutter action to be
had<00:02:33.739> although<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> super<00:02:35.400> great

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
had although this is a super great

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
had although this is a super great
bridge<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.360> I'll<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.630> my<00:02:36.750> best<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
bridge but so I'll do my best to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.850 
bridge but so I'll do my best to
replicate<00:02:37.799> what<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> record

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
replicate what it is like on the record

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:56.460 
replicate what it is like on the record
so<00:02:40.880> part<00:02:41.880> one

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:10.179 

look<00:02:57.939> easy<00:02:58.939> enough<00:02:59.180> one<00:02:59.720> more<00:02:59.900> time

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:29.220 

great<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.840> part<00:03:12.140> two<00:03:12.349> looks<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:12.859> this<00:03:20.439> again

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.039 

and<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.400> part<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.940> alternate<00:03:32.569> pick<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
and for this part I alternate pick the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.589 
and for this part I alternate pick the
first<00:03:33.290> rundown<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.340> then<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.090> second<00:03:35.450> one's

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
first rundown and then the second one's

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.780 
first rundown and then the second one's
kind<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.930> an<00:03:36.079> arpeggio<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.340> kind<00:03:37.609> of<00:03:37.639> like

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
kind of an arpeggio so it's kind of like

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.170 
kind of an arpeggio so it's kind of like
sweat<00:03:38.150> sweet<00:03:38.569> picked<00:03:39.760> usually<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:40.939> use

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
sweat sweet picked usually I just use

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.819 
sweat sweet picked usually I just use
like<00:03:41.540> every<00:03:41.930> form<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.260> hybrid<00:03:42.680> picking

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
like every form of hybrid picking

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.099 
like every form of hybrid picking
whatever<00:03:43.370> ends<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.060> more<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.689> know<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.930> most

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
whatever ends up more you know the most

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:53.840 
whatever ends up more you know the most
comfortable<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.829> play<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.849> part<00:03:47.180> so

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.860 

great<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:56.590> leads<00:03:56.830> in<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.210> third<00:03:58.510> part

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
great that leads in to the third part

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.990 
great that leads in to the third part
which<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.410> kind<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.800> arpeggio<00:04:00.400> section

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
which is this kind of arpeggio section

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.560 
which is this kind of arpeggio section
and<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:02.560> might<00:04:03.430> look<00:04:03.580> at<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> timing<00:04:04.270> of<00:04:04.360> this

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
and I might look at the timing of this

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.080 
and I might look at the timing of this
when<00:04:04.960> I<00:04:04.990> go<00:04:05.710> to<00:04:05.770> put<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.370> tab<00:04:06.610> down<00:04:06.820> for

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
when I go to put the tab down for

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.680 
when I go to put the tab down for
everybody<00:04:07.540> but<00:04:08.610> it's<00:04:09.610> actually<00:04:10.210> kind<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.540> an

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
everybody but it's actually kind of an

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.720 
everybody but it's actually kind of an
odd<00:04:10.870> amount<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.350> notes<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.980> fit<00:04:12.220> into<00:04:12.460> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
odd amount of notes to fit into the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.240 
odd amount of notes to fit into the
phrase<00:04:13.150> some<00:04:14.020> kind<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.500> maybe<00:04:14.950> fifth

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
phrase some kind of like maybe fifth

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.430 
phrase some kind of like maybe fifth
tuplet<00:04:15.640> action<00:04:16.000> going<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.390> or<00:04:16.600> something<00:04:16.630> once

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
tuplet action going on or something once

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.009 
tuplet action going on or something once
again<00:04:17.650> we'll<00:04:17.739> look<00:04:17.769> at<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.100> closer<00:04:18.280> but<00:04:19.019> the

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
again we'll look at it closer but the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:37.240 
again we'll look at it closer but the
notes<00:04:20.200> are<00:04:20.470> as<00:04:20.620> such<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:30.000> little<00:04:31.000> faster

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:54.860 

okay<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.490> then<00:04:38.669> from<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.060> bend<00:04:39.509> at<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.840> top

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:05.159 

and<00:04:55.870> that's<00:04:56.020> it

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.229
