the fact of 32 players some people

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
the fact of 32 players some people
actually<00:01:07.710> saying<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> then

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
actually saying it's too much and then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually saying it's too much and then
the<00:01:09.299> people<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.840> me<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> course<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.500> actually

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the people like me of course I actually

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
the people like me of course I actually
agree<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> 32<00:01:11.909> plays<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> be

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
agree in that 32 plays is going to be

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
agree in that 32 plays is going to be
absolutely<00:01:12.930> insane<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.580> GTA<00:01:15.030> 4<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
absolutely insane now in GTA 4 on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.929 
absolutely insane now in GTA 4 on
consoles<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.920> maximum<00:01:17.430> numbers<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
consoles I think the maximum numbers of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
consoles I think the maximum numbers of
plays<00:01:18.180> are<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.750> 16<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:19.830> sure

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
plays are actually 16 I'm not too sure

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
plays are actually 16 I'm not too sure
at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> top<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.850> head<00:01:20.880> can't<00:01:21.540> remember<00:01:21.960> if

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
at the top of my head can't remember if

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
at the top of my head can't remember if
that<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.409> true<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> was

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that was true or not but i think it was

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.999

nother level but of course the GTA 4 map
wasn't<00:01:43.649> humongous<00:01:44.610> i<00:01:44.790> guess<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> could<00:01:45.329> say

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
wasn't humongous i guess you could say

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
wasn't humongous i guess you could say
it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.320> decent<00:01:46.560> size<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.430> opinion<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it was a decent size in my opinion and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.460 
it was a decent size in my opinion and
then<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> course<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.869> were<00:01:48.930> maximum

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
then of course when they were maximum

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
then of course when they were maximum
people<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> lobbies<00:01:50.820> most<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> them

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.840 
two helicopters and do all that kind of
stuff<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.049> most<00:01:55.530> people<00:01:55.740> were<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.430> one

a lot you just gotta think of it like
this<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.880> course<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.360> GTA<00:02:03.750> 5<00:02:03.810> map<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this now of course the GTA 5 map is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.110 
this now of course the GTA 5 map is
meant<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> size<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.340> GTA<00:02:05.969> 4<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.570> GT

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
meant to be the size of GTA 4 and GT

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.400 
meant to be the size of GTA 4 and GT
san<00:02:07.330> andreas<00:02:07.630> em<00:02:07.840> red<00:02:08.050> dead<00:02:08.229> redemption

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
san andreas em red dead redemption

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.469 
san andreas em red dead redemption
combined<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.700> there<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.450> be

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
combined so there is going to be

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.480 
combined so there is going to be
actually<00:02:10.690> humongous<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.800> there<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.400> to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
actually humongous and there is going to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.610 
actually humongous and there is going to
be<00:02:12.520> way<00:02:12.820> more<00:02:12.850> activities<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.810> do<00:02:13.930> than<00:02:14.080> gta4

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
be way more activities to do than gta4

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.830 
be way more activities to do than gta4
so<00:02:15.190> not<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.580> lot<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.850> people<00:02:16.000> will<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.720> in

those kinds of things I think there will
be<00:03:41.500> limitations<00:03:41.980> like<00:03:42.340> they<00:03:42.489> were<00:03:42.550> in<00:03:42.880> GTA

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
be limitations like they were in GTA

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.000 
be limitations like they were in GTA
four<00:03:43.420> but<00:03:43.959> that's<00:03:44.080> just<00:03:44.200> my<00:03:44.380> opinion<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.860> guess

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
four but that's just my opinion I guess

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.530 
four but that's just my opinion I guess
we<00:03:45.160> can<00:03:45.280> only<00:03:45.340> wait<00:03:45.520> for<00:03:45.850> rockstar<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.390> say

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
in the game so you can actually just go

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.530 
in the game so you can actually just go
and<00:04:11.890> text<00:04:12.100> them<00:04:12.250> inside<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.850> game<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.239> think<00:04:13.480> I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and text them inside the game I think I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.569 
and text them inside the game I think I
would<00:04:13.690> actually<00:04:14.110> be<00:04:14.290> pretty<00:04:14.500> cool<00:04:14.830> something

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
would actually be pretty cool something

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.060 
would actually be pretty cool something
easy<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.970> navigate<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.660> well

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
easy to navigate as well

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.530 
easy to navigate as well
rather<00:04:17.220> than<00:04:17.310> having<00:04:17.550> to<00:04:17.670> like<00:04:17.970> click<00:04:18.360> the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
rather than having to like click the

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.970 
rather than having to like click the
home<00:04:18.720> button<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.200> go<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.350> your<00:04:19.620> friends<00:04:19.950> list

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
home button and go to your friends list

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.440 
home button and go to your friends list
and<00:04:20.310> send<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.550> message<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.940> think<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.300> would<00:04:21.390> be

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
and send a message I think that would be

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.790 
and send a message I think that would be
a<00:04:21.570> pretty<00:04:21.840> cool<00:04:22.140> feature<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.740> in

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
a pretty cool feature to have in

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.590 
a pretty cool feature to have in
multiplayer<00:04:23.280> now<00:04:23.790> of<00:04:23.850> course<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.150> really<00:04:24.390> can't

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
multiplayer now of course I really can't

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.840 
multiplayer now of course I really can't
say<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:25.020> about<00:04:25.230> that<00:04:25.560> last<00:04:25.830> topic<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.460> think

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
say much about that last topic I think

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.220 
say much about that last topic I think
it's<00:04:27.000> something<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.330> rockstar<00:04:27.720> actually<00:04:28.020> may

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
it's something a rockstar actually may

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.530 
it's something a rockstar actually may

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.990 
the old ones but of course we will have
the<00:04:48.870> basics<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> team<00:04:49.830> deathmatch<00:04:50.400> GTA

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
the basics like the team deathmatch GTA

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.750 
the basics like the team deathmatch GTA
race<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.230> other<00:04:52.380> race<00:04:52.650> free<00:04:53.190> mode<00:04:53.460> and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
race then the other race free mode and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.100 
race then the other race free mode and
what<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:53.940> kind<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.240> stuff<00:04:54.420> just<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> basic

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
what that kind of stuff just the basic

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.840 
what that kind of stuff just the basic
things<00:04:55.350> now<00:04:55.770> like<00:04:55.800> i<00:04:56.190> said<00:04:56.370> earlier<00:04:56.550> about

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
things now like i said earlier about

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.480 
things now like i said earlier about
having<00:04:57.390> Cruz<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.900> game<00:04:58.020> now<00:04:58.230> this<00:04:59.130> got<00:04:59.370> me

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
having Cruz in the game now this got me

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.280 
having Cruz in the game now this got me
thinking<00:04:59.520> in<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.030> game<00:05:00.240> mode<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.780> kind<00:05:01.170> of

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
thinking in the game mode so it kind of

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.010 
thinking in the game mode so it kind of
could<00:05:01.470> be<00:05:01.500> like<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> team<00:05:02.700> deathmatch<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.450> bit<00:05:03.810> or

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
could be like a team deathmatch a bit or

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.290 
could be like a team deathmatch a bit or
a<00:05:04.080> domination<00:05:04.830> if<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:05.370> making<00:05:05.670> any<00:05:05.790> sense<00:05:06.030> it

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
a domination if I'm making any sense it

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.510 
a domination if I'm making any sense it
so<00:05:06.720> let's<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.170> say<00:05:07.320> one<00:05:07.590> crew<00:05:07.890> could<00:05:08.130> be<00:05:08.310> like

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
so let's just say one crew could be like

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.830 
so let's just say one crew could be like
the<00:05:08.640> gross<00:05:08.880> street<00:05:09.120> gang<00:05:09.330> for<00:05:09.570> instance

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
the gross street gang for instance

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
the gross street gang for instance
people<00:05:09.930> since<00:05:10.200> we<00:05:10.320> know<00:05:10.440> we're<00:05:10.590> gonna<00:05:10.680> have

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
people since we know we're gonna have

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.830 
people since we know we're gonna have
gangs<00:05:11.130> in<00:05:11.310> GTA<00:05:11.670> 5<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.120> if<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.300> grocery<00:05:12.690> and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
gangs in GTA 5 so if the grocery and

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.720 
gangs in GTA 5 so if the grocery and
barliss<00:05:13.170> are<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.380> only<00:05:13.500> gangs<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:14.070> GTA<00:05:14.430> 5

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
barliss are the only gangs in GTA 5

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850 
barliss are the only gangs in GTA 5
maybe<00:05:15.210> we<00:05:15.450> can<00:05:15.600> be<00:05:15.720> any<00:05:15.990> one<00:05:16.170> of<00:05:16.230> those<00:05:16.440> gangs

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
maybe we can be any one of those gangs

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.410 
maybe we can be any one of those gangs
and<00:05:17.070> then<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.280> just<00:05:17.310> basically<00:05:17.550> have<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.180> fight

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
and then we just basically have to fight

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.510 
and then we just basically have to fight
and<00:05:18.660> keep<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.290> piece<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.560> territory<00:05:19.950> for<00:05:20.490> a

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
and keep a piece of territory for a

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.890 
and keep a piece of territory for a
certain<00:05:20.880> amount<00:05:21.060> of<00:05:21.210> time<00:05:21.420> and<00:05:21.690> then<00:05:21.750> that

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
certain amount of time and then that

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.570 
certain amount of time and then that
will<00:05:22.020> gain<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.470> couple<00:05:23.040> points<00:05:23.400> in<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
will gain you a couple points in the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.770 
will gain you a couple points in the
game<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.060> of<00:05:24.180> course<00:05:24.210> there<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.600> like<00:05:24.750> a

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
game and of course there is like a

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.720 
game and of course there is like a
certain<00:05:25.170> points<00:05:25.470> maybe<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.830> like<00:05:25.980> 100<00:05:26.430> points

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
certain points maybe of like 100 points

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.180 
certain points maybe of like 100 points
or<00:05:26.910> something<00:05:27.870> along<00:05:28.050> those<00:05:28.320> lines<00:05:28.380> now

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
or something along those lines now

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.010 
or something along those lines now
huntin<00:05:29.730> could<00:05:29.940> actually<00:05:30.090> go<00:05:30.420> down<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.780> game

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
huntin could actually go down as a game

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.900 
huntin could actually go down as a game
mode<00:05:31.290> in<00:05:31.470> multiplayer<00:05:31.890> as<00:05:32.190> well<00:05:32.400> maybe<00:05:32.730> you

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
mode in multiplayer as well maybe you

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.160 
mode in multiplayer as well maybe you
might<00:05:33.090> have<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.300> certain<00:05:33.660> amount<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:33.960> time

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
might have a certain amount of time

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.930 
might have a certain amount of time
let's<00:05:34.440> just<00:05:34.650> say<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.830> have<00:05:35.070> like<00:05:35.310> 10<00:05:35.700> minutes

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
let's just say you have like 10 minutes

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.420 
let's just say you have like 10 minutes
to<00:05:36.240> hunt<00:05:36.450> as<00:05:36.630> many<00:05:36.870> animals<00:05:37.200> as<00:05:37.650> possible<00:05:38.280> or

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
to hunt as many animals as possible or

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.160 
to hunt as many animals as possible or
should<00:05:38.700> I<00:05:38.760> say<00:05:38.790> kill<00:05:39.180> as<00:05:39.390> many<00:05:39.420> animals<00:05:39.870> as

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
should I say kill as many animals as

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.840 
should I say kill as many animals as
possible<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:40.800> let's<00:05:41.010> just<00:05:41.190> say<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.460> like<00:05:41.640> 10

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
possible so let's just say this like 10

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.430 
possible so let's just say this like 10
people<00:05:42.270> in<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.390> lobby<00:05:42.600> and<00:05:42.930> then<00:05:43.050> like<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.230> said

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
people in a lobby and then like I said

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.810 
people in a lobby and then like I said
you<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.650> 10<00:05:43.860> minutes<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.280> basically<00:05:44.610> the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
you have 10 minutes and basically the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.730 
you have 10 minutes and basically the
more<00:05:45.060> animals<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.870> killed<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.260> more<00:05:46.410> points

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
more animals you killed a more points

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.440 
more animals you killed a more points
you<00:05:46.800> get<00:05:47.040> in<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.340> at<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.640> end<00:05:47.790> it<00:05:48.030> comes<00:05:48.300> down

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
you get in and at the end it comes down

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.450 
you get in and at the end it comes down
to<00:05:48.810> whoever<00:05:49.080> killed<00:05:49.500> or<00:05:49.740> hunted<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.250> most

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
to whoever killed or hunted the most

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.520 
to whoever killed or hunted the most
animals<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.210> think<00:05:51.570> that<00:05:51.720> could<00:05:51.840> be<00:05:51.900> a<00:05:52.050> game

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
animals I think that could be a game

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.900 
animals I think that could be a game
mode<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:52.890> rocks<00:05:53.100> aware<00:05:53.370> that<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.640> would<00:05:53.760> be

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
mode that rocks aware that it would be

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.760 
mode that rocks aware that it would be
pretty<00:05:54.210> cool<00:05:54.270> as<00:05:54.540> well<00:05:54.570> now<00:05:55.140> going<00:05:55.470> on<00:05:55.710> to

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
pretty cool as well now going on to

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.920 
pretty cool as well now going on to
underwater<00:05:56.730> life<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.210> guess<00:05:57.480> you<00:05:57.600> could<00:05:57.630> call

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
underwater life I guess you could call

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.170 
underwater life I guess you could call
it<00:05:57.990> or<00:05:58.260> just<00:05:58.650> generally<00:05:59.190> water<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.760> think<00:06:00.090> they

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
it or just generally water I think they

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.420 
it or just generally water I think they
should<00:06:00.360> be<00:06:00.510> like<00:06:00.690> jet<00:06:01.050> ski<00:06:01.380> races<00:06:01.890> and<00:06:02.100> things

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
should be like jet ski races and things

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.860 
should be like jet ski races and things
along<00:06:02.640> those<00:06:02.820> lines<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.390> think<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.690> would<00:06:03.810> be

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
along those lines I think that would be

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.810 
along those lines I think that would be
pretty<00:06:04.200> cool<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.530> have<00:06:04.770> in<00:06:04.860> GTA<00:06:05.190> 5<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:05.610> would<00:06:05.700> be

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
pretty cool to have in GTA 5 it would be

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.670 
pretty cool to have in GTA 5 it would be
really<00:06:06.030> fun<00:06:06.150> as<00:06:06.510> well<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:06.960> then<00:06:07.200> going<00:06:07.440> on<00:06:07.620> to

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
really fun as well and then going on to

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.100 
really fun as well and then going on to
underwater<00:06:08.340> maybe<00:06:08.910> no<00:06:09.090> actually<00:06:09.450> maybe<00:06:09.750> lucky

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
underwater maybe no actually maybe lucky

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.840 
underwater maybe no actually maybe lucky
survival<00:06:10.860> kind<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:11.190> thing<00:06:11.400> because<00:06:11.580> of<00:06:11.700> course

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
survival kind of thing because of course

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.190 
survival kind of thing because of course
we<00:06:11.970> know<00:06:12.090> we're<00:06:12.240> going<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.420> have<00:06:12.540> shocks<00:06:12.930> and

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
we know we're going to have shocks and

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.570 
we know we're going to have shocks and
if<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.380> Sharks<00:06:13.680> are<00:06:13.740> gonna<00:06:13.890> attack<00:06:14.250> you<00:06:14.430> I

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
if the Sharks are gonna attack you I

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.040 
if the Sharks are gonna attack you I
know<00:06:14.760> that<00:06:14.790> kind<00:06:15.120> of<00:06:15.210> stuff<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.510> will<00:06:15.660> be<00:06:15.780> a<00:06:15.810> bit

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
know that kind of stuff it will be a bit

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.720 
know that kind of stuff it will be a bit
challenging<00:06:16.560> so<00:06:16.830> maybe<00:06:17.040> they<00:06:17.190> may<00:06:17.430> actually

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
challenging so maybe they may actually

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.700 
challenging so maybe they may actually
be<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.090> survival<00:06:18.570> kind<00:06:18.900> of<00:06:18.990> thing<00:06:19.170> ought<00:06:19.350> to<00:06:19.410> be

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
be a survival kind of thing ought to be

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.900 
be a survival kind of thing ought to be
really<00:06:20.010> insane<00:06:20.310> there<00:06:20.490> should<00:06:20.640> be<00:06:20.760> like<00:06:20.850> a

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
really insane there should be like a

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.580 
really insane there should be like a
zombie<00:06:21.240> apocalypse<00:06:21.330> type<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:21.990> game<00:06:22.140> mode<00:06:22.380> and

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
zombie apocalypse type of game mode and

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.590 
zombie apocalypse type of game mode and

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.470 
who yet whoever survives the longest
wins<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:25.560> last<00:06:25.740> that<00:06:25.980> last<00:06:26.040> like<00:06:26.850> I<00:06:27.060> there

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
wins that last that last like I there

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.300 
wins that last that last like I there
was<00:06:27.660> pretty<00:06:27.960> crazy<00:06:28.230> but<00:06:28.590> have<00:06:28.770> a<00:06:28.919> zombie

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
was pretty crazy but have a zombie

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.290 
was pretty crazy but have a zombie
apocalypse<00:06:29.400> would<00:06:29.940> be

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
apocalypse would be

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.270 
apocalypse would be
actually<00:06:30.930> insane<00:06:31.289> that'll<00:06:31.680> be<00:06:31.740> really<00:06:31.949> fun

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
actually insane that'll be really fun

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.219 
actually insane that'll be really fun
and<00:06:32.460> then<00:06:32.789> lastly<00:06:33.180> maybe<00:06:33.509> they<00:06:33.659> actually<00:06:33.990> may

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
and then lastly maybe they actually may

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.010 
and then lastly maybe they actually may
actually<00:06:34.440> be<00:06:34.830> like<00:06:35.340> playing<00:06:35.759> races<00:06:36.330> or<00:06:36.539> and<00:06:36.930> it

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
actually be like playing races or and it

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.210 
actually be like playing races or and it
could<00:06:37.139> be<00:06:37.259> something<00:06:37.500> like<00:06:37.740> where<00:06:37.949> you're<00:06:38.099> in

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
could be something like where you're in

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.369 
could be something like where you're in
a<00:06:38.310> military<00:06:38.759> aircraft<00:06:39.180> such<00:06:39.900> as<00:06:39.930> like<00:06:40.229> the

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
a military aircraft such as like the

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.930 
a military aircraft such as like the
hydro<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:40.860> you<00:06:41.039> think<00:06:41.220> along<00:06:41.460> those<00:06:41.639> lines

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
hydro and you think along those lines

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.730 
hydro and you think along those lines
and<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.389> basically<00:06:42.539> you<00:06:42.960> just<00:06:42.990> have<00:06:43.319> like<00:06:43.500> a

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
and it basically you just have like a

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.619 
and it basically you just have like a
big<00:06:44.190> flight<00:06:44.490> in<00:06:44.669> the<00:06:44.789> air<00:06:44.909> I<00:06:44.940> think<00:06:45.360> that<00:06:45.509> would

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
big flight in the air I think that would

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.719 
big flight in the air I think that would
be<00:06:45.720> pretty<00:06:45.930> cool<00:06:46.080> as<00:06:46.319> well<00:06:46.349> my<00:06:47.039> guys<00:06:47.220> is<00:06:47.400> it<00:06:47.550> for
