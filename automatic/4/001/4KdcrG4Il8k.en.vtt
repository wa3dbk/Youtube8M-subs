the ball very physical and he showed

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.970 
the ball very physical and he showed
some<00:00:36.260> patients<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> things

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
with George in the learning curve is you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.330 
with George in the learning curve is you
know<00:00:40.410> he's<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.100> bit<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
know he's just a little bit out of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.500 
know he's just a little bit out of
control<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.850> thought<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.300> showed<00:00:42.450> great

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
control I thought he showed great

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.069

patience<00:00:43.260> today<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.629> corners

patience today I really like the corners

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
patience today I really like the corners
in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.500> they're<00:00:46.710> playing<00:00:46.860> they're

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
in the way they're playing they're

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.250 
in the way they're playing they're
competing<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> ball<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.079> we're

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
competing for the ball you know we're

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.720 
competing for the ball you know we're
trying<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> push<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> ball<00:00:50.039> vertically<00:00:50.460> down

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
trying to push the ball vertically down

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
trying to push the ball vertically down
the<00:00:50.910> field<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.559> we're<00:00:52.739> making

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the field and you know we're making

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.350 
the field and you know we're making
plays<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> field<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> two<00:00:54.329> things

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
plays down the field so the two things

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
plays down the field so the two things
that<00:00:54.660> stood<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> me<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that stood out to me is you know the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
that stood out to me is you know the
ability<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> run<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> football<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.390> had<00:00:57.539> our

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
ability to run the football we had our

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
ability to run the football we had our
first<00:00:58.020> 17<00:00:58.770> plays<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.789> think<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.000> had

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
first 17 plays I don't think we had

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
first 17 plays I don't think we had
anything<00:01:00.329> less<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.780> seven<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> run<00:01:01.530> game

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
anything less than seven in the run game

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.579 
anything less than seven in the run game
so<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.550> running<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> ball<00:01:03.120> effectively

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
so you know running the ball effectively

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.870 
so you know running the ball effectively
and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.769> our<00:01:04.890> corners<00:01:05.280> playing<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> ball<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and then our corners playing the ball in

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
and then our corners playing the ball in
here<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.960> day<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.439> know

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
tomorrow might be something else but it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
comfortable with basically going as far

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.550 
comfortable with basically going as far
as<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> last<00:01:18.270> year<00:01:18.479> even<00:01:18.659> maybe<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> way

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
as you last year even maybe all the way

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
as you last year even maybe all the way
to<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:19.979> weeks<00:01:20.130> 10<00:01:20.460> days<00:01:20.610> before<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
to like two weeks 10 days before the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
to like two weeks 10 days before the
opener<00:01:21.270> could<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> long<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
opener could it go that long you know I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
opener could it go that long you know I
think<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.729> depends<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.420> progress<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
think it depends on how we progress you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
think it depends on how we progress you
know<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.560> there's<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.060> know

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
know if there's more than one you know

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
know if there's more than one you know
which<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> believe<00:01:28.439> there's<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
which I believe there's going to be more

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
which I believe there's going to be more
than<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.340> quarterback<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.570> certainly

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
than one quarterback then then certainly

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
than one quarterback then then certainly
will<00:01:31.140> take<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.439> longer<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.400> time

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
will take that longer you know time

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.679 
will take that longer you know time
because<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.210> starting<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> think

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
because then you're starting to think

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
because then you're starting to think
about<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> playing<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.829> than<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.130> are

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
about are you playing more than one are

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
about are you playing more than one are
you<00:01:35.340> playing<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> playing

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you playing to you know are you playing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.640 
you playing to you know are you playing
three<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.840> there's<00:01:40.049> no<00:01:40.259> clear

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
three and so I think if there's no clear

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.440 
three and so I think if there's no clear
break<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.579> through<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> spring<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
break as we go through the spring I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
break as we go through the spring I
think<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.869> process<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.560> continues<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
think this process to continues to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
think this process to continues to
evolve<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.210> work<00:01:45.420> through<00:01:45.450> preseason<00:01:45.930> camp

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
evolve as we work through preseason camp

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.469 
evolve as we work through preseason camp
that's<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.829> take<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.430> looking<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> right

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that's my take at looking at it right

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
that's my take at looking at it right
now<00:01:48.649> after<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> first<00:01:50.340> couple<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.880> days
