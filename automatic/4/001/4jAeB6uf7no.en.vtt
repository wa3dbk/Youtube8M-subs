00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.479
 today now today we are going to 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.630
 prepare a delicious lasagna of plates that 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:13.600
 it's my teacher's favorite dish 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.340
 that he loves and ends at minute minute 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.829
 fascina was arranged usually prepare it with 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.439
 very often well let's start 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.400
 then with the ingredients to make 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.810
 this plate 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.609
 we're going to need raven cheese alone more 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.410
 or less a full focus the amount 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.619
 desired three eyes that we're going to lower a 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.619
 bit 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.649
 obviously two types and one is the cream 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.500
 of this plate and the spinach is coming 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.660
 well of its cream and as if it were a puree 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.589
 more or less work find in all 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.719
 supermarkets 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.360
 and we are also going to need this other 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.850
 guy who is spinach pushes 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.670
 complete that also comes with a 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.170
 sauce included some ramsés is called here 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.280
 in German as a basic white sauce 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.940
 that you can also add buy them 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.290
 natural and do them yourself and that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.150
 but that would be a process because more 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 complicated longer so we 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.490
 we use 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 we're going to be two whole package ok 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 of whole leaves a little bit of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 brand powder seasoning 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 you want and of course the lasagna 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.050
 the lasagna on plates this is this that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 we buy in particular so that 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.750
 be prepared without prior cooking can 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330
 also use integral can 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 also use the green that is 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.030
 included for example good as pasta 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.650
 that demanded a few pesetas and we're also going 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.940
 to need a little bit of oil 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.730
 olive well to grease the of that 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.960
 well the next step is to start 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.610
 Defrost the spinach in the pot I 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.980
 previously put a little oil 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 olive and let's leave then that 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.100
 the spinach 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.290
 defrost could not have frozen the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.840
 previously outside nor in the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.849
 microwave because I would lose that liquid 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.830
 Well, what do you have and the sauce that you have 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.560
 included also inside and is the way 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.290
 to need for the pasta to be woman 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.390
 then and you can serve well and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.540
 thawed is thawed 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 very fast really relatively 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.060
 fast and then we are going to add 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.739
 more or less half a glass of milk 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.670
 this skim milk we can use 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.459
 also whole law if we wish 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.410
 because of my love more or less this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.430
 is the consistency that we should have 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.670
 at this point it is not a soft paste not 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.170
 can be too much to play ok for 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.180
 what then then would not be widely used 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.640
 right now they are going to add the cheese 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 this cheese like the one used by dyn 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.959
 soles as if it were a cream and it 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.110
 dissolves very quickly as soon as we put it 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.140
 and inside in the final sauce 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.050
 let's then let it be consumed or 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.400
 of fruit completely take into account 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.100
 that this preparation we are doing to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.200
 medium fire in the preparation does not boil 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.370
 the preparation is hot but not mine 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.840
 otherwise it would burn in the background 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.910
 does not have to be over medium heat like him 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.310
 It should not serve much less 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.340
 well then let's add the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.340
 remaining seasonings is a little bit of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.070
 garlic seasoned let's add 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.920
 a spoonful of seasoning powder 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.630
 the brand that you want and also 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.730
 let's add a pinch of pepper 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.920
 this will be at ease you can subscribe 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.830
 replace it with chile and we're going to add 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.960
 a tablespoon of soy sauce the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.780
 soy sauces is optional but we 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.910
 we liked to put on the skin 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.750
 mix is ​​now ready and we are going to lower it 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.610
 direct barbate 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:59.290
 let's then use a base and the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.110
 first layer is going to be pasta 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.320
 spinach 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.880
 because you put a layer of lasagna 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.130
 first, they are going to burn in the 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.590
 background and it's going to stay at home and it lasts 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.920
 then we are going to put a layer first 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.950
 of feat in spinach of cream 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.410
 of the end that we have already done 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.139
 then we will go alternating 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:29.300
 a layer of the feat of pasta 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.639
 and a layer of cream from the areas and we're going 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.800
 to repeat the same step until 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.879
 let's finish one side 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.550
 the cream that we have is important that 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.590
 the last layer as the first one is 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.240
 of cream so keep in mind that if 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.639
 the cream is running out you can not 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.319
 put another layer of pasta because it has 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.319
 to be covered with the cream 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.230
 this silver pt well easy to do 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.900
 my loves relatively easy and it's very 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.720
 very nutritious and it also tastes very delicious 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.790
 a very good way that we and 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.010
 also to families like spinach a 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.230
 that holds the person so 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.270
 generally do not eat is that they do not 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.190
 like its flavor but prepared from this 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.190
 way is super easy to course 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.440
 well already one time then that the last 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.740
 layer this bet let's put a layer 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.370
 of cheese can be sliced ​​or it can be 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.230
 grated 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.020
 we have used it grated and 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.120
 this is jesus buddha we can use the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.590
 who claims to have the easiest hand or 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.590
 the one that is called to your liking also 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.020
 obviously this dish has 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.660
 carbohydrates and also has fats from 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.910
 cheese then it is not a food 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.860
 precisely very low in calories 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.960
 Now let's put it in the oven more or 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.550
 less until I brown the cheese that 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.779
 we have in the upper part to 180 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.939
 degrees and that's how the plate would look 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:02.509
 young must then be golden by 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.009
 on top they should not burn either has 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.169
 flavor that 's how you would look then 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.749
 Served dish tastes delicious bible 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.419
 delicious the smell of cheese with pasta 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:12.939
 like nava I think you liked it 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.349
 the one of this attack they put it into practice 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.329
 and it will be so until the next 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.669
 forget to follow me there are also many 

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:23.079
 channels and can also see other 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.079
 recipes that I also have in this channel
