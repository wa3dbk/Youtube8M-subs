00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
just one year later several countries
broke<00:00:21.090> those<00:00:21.330> rules<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.080> least<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.619> would

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
broke those rules but at least you would

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
broke those rules but at least you would
never<00:00:23.160> bail<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.699> countries<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.750> broke<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
never bail out countries that broke the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.890 
never bail out countries that broke the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
rules and in 2010 you did but at least

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.120 
rules and in 2010 you did but at least
you<00:00:28.050> wouldn't<00:00:28.320> buy<00:00:28.470> their<00:00:28.680> sovereign

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you wouldn't buy their sovereign

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
you wouldn't buy their sovereign
government<00:00:29.760> bonds<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.599> then<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> did<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
government bonds but then you did and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
government bonds but then you did and
now<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.309> new<00:00:32.520> fiscal<00:00:32.790> pact<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
now we have this new fiscal pact and you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.860 
now we have this new fiscal pact and you
have<00:00:34.350> new<00:00:34.590> targets<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.550> Spain's<00:00:36.059> deficit<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
have new targets for Spain's deficit and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.520 
have new targets for Spain's deficit and
you<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.380> already<00:00:38.030> renegotiated<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.530> that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you have already renegotiated that that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
you have already renegotiated that that
deficit<00:00:41.040> rule<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> question<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.270> why

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
deficit rule so the question is why

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
deficit rule so the question is why
should<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.559> your<00:00:43.739> word<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.309> granted

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
should we take your word for granted

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.549 
should we take your word for granted
this<00:00:45.300> time<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> very<00:00:47.550> important<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
this time it's very important to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
this time it's very important to
differentiate<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:50.100> clearly<00:00:50.489> their

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
differentiate very clearly their

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
differentiate very clearly their
political<00:00:51.360> decisions<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.800> based<00:00:53.129> on

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
political decisions which are based on

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
political decisions which are based on
statistics<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.850> statistics<00:00:56.850> itself<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
statistics and statistics itself and I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.049 
statistics and statistics itself and I
think<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.699> cases<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.020> mentioned

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
think that in cases which you mentioned

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.080 
think that in cases which you mentioned
statistics<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.739> was<00:01:04.739> published<00:01:05.250> correctly

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
statistics was was published correctly

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.010 
statistics was was published correctly

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
of course we had a problem with Greek

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
of course we had a problem with Greek

actually our our experts helped you to
solve<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:19.200> problems<00:01:19.409> by<00:01:20.189> letting<00:01:20.790> Italy<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
solve these problems by letting Italy in

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.649 
solve these problems by letting Italy in
when<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.590> satisfying<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> criteria

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
when it was not satisfying the criteria

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.620 
when it was not satisfying the criteria
they<00:01:24.659> could<00:01:24.990> later<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.820> well<00:01:26.939> refused

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they could later not very well refused

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
they could later not very well refused
Greece<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> true<00:01:29.610> reason<00:01:30.090> why

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
Greece that is the true reason why

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
Greece that is the true reason why
Greece<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.220> let<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.729> not

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
Greece was and was it was let in not

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
Greece was and was it was let in not
because<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.720> falsified<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> statistics

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
because they falsified the statistics

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
because they falsified the statistics
which<00:01:35.430> he<00:01:35.579> did<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.939> course<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
which he did of course but because the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
which he did of course but because the
European<00:01:38.610> Council<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> heads<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
European Council which is the heads of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
European Council which is the heads of
state<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.710> government<00:01:41.540> thought<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.020> they

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
state and government thought that they

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
state and government thought that they
could<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.500> refuse<00:01:43.979> Greece<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.790> had

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
could not refuse Greece what they had

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
could not refuse Greece what they had
allowed<00:01:45.180> Italy<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
allowed Italy so there you have the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.760 
allowed Italy so there you have the
curse<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> evil<00:01:47.520> deed<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.920> means<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
curse of the evil deed so it means that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.480 
curse of the evil deed so it means that
statistics<00:01:52.770> already<00:01:53.640> produces<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> good

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
statistics already produces a good

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.550 
statistics already produces a good
quality<00:01:56.490> basis<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.420> sound<00:01:57.869> decision-making

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
quality basis for sound decision-making

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.300 
quality basis for sound decision-making
but<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.759> want<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.360> two<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.130> go

this is what what we proposed was our

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
what part of human nature explains this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.990 
what part of human nature explains this
well<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.410> big<00:02:28.590> question<00:02:28.790> I'm<00:02:29.790> not

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
well that's a big question I'm not
