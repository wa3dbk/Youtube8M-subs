salt because that holds the dye onto the
fabric<00:01:49.430> next<00:01:50.330> up<00:01:50.659> we'll<00:01:50.869> read<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
fabric next up we'll read the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.680 
fabric next up we'll read the
instructions<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> dialogue<00:01:52.430> box<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.060> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
instructions on the dialogue box and to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.420 
instructions on the dialogue box and to
be<00:01:53.780> honest<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.140> kind<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.409> just<00:01:54.590> winged<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.070> I've

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
be honest I kind of just winged it I've

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.389 
be honest I kind of just winged it I've
done<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.850> few<00:01:55.880> times<00:01:56.180> before<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:58.070> go

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
done it a few times before so I just go

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.469 
done it a few times before so I just go
for<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:58.909> there's<00:01:59.149> someone<00:01:59.299> that

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
for it but if there's someone that

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.029 
for it but if there's someone that
hasn't<00:01:59.630> made<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.990> before<00:02:00.319> then<00:02:00.619> definitely

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
hasn't made it before then definitely

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.559 
hasn't made it before then definitely
read<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.310> instructions<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.390> follow

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
read the instructions and just follow

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.430 
read the instructions and just follow
everything<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.200> tells<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:05.440> started

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
everything it tells you to do I started

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.520 
everything it tells you to do I started
off<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.619> by<00:02:07.130> pouring<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.269> salt<00:02:08.630> into<00:02:09.380> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
off just by pouring in the salt into the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.490 
off just by pouring in the salt into the
one<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:09.979> spray<00:02:10.160> bottles<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:12.319> kind

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
one of the spray bottles and I just kind

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.949 
one of the spray bottles and I just kind
of<00:02:12.590> guessed<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
of guessed it really and this is the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.350 
of guessed it really and this is the
pink<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:18.350> I'm<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.530> using<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.340> trying<00:02:20.299> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
pink one I'm just using now trying to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.140 
pink one I'm just using now trying to
open<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.630> packet<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:22.519> also<00:02:22.819> try<00:02:23.000> not<00:02:23.030> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
open the packet and also try not to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
open the packet and also try not to
spill<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.569> everywhere<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> same<00:02:24.410> time<00:02:24.620> on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
spill it everywhere at the same time on

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.699 
spill it everywhere at the same time on
here's<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.760> blue<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.239> this<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> really

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
here's the blue one this one is a really

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.809 
here's the blue one this one is a really
nice<00:02:27.980> color<00:02:30.310> sadly<00:02:31.310> will<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.519> spray<00:02:31.790> bottle

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
nice color sadly will this spray bottle

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.569 
nice color sadly will this spray bottle
it<00:02:32.239> was<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.690> broken<00:02:33.170> for<00:02:33.470> some<00:02:33.560> reason<00:02:33.890> but

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
it was like broken for some reason but

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.210 
it was like broken for some reason but
yeah<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> didn't<00:02:35.180> add<00:02:35.299> too<00:02:35.510> much<00:02:35.709> dye<00:02:36.709> because<00:02:37.130> I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
yeah I didn't add too much dye because I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.890 
yeah I didn't add too much dye because I
don't<00:02:37.400> want<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.610> colors<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.880> be<00:02:37.970> too<00:02:38.269> dark<00:02:38.570> I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
don't want the colors to be too dark I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.620 
don't want the colors to be too dark I
decided<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.440> lot<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:40.070> lot<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.459> lukewarm<00:02:40.700> water

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
decided a lot a lot of lukewarm water

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.569 
decided a lot a lot of lukewarm water
I<00:02:41.680> literally<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.799> filled<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.190> whole<00:02:43.310> thing

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
I literally just filled the whole thing

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.039 
I literally just filled the whole thing
up<00:02:43.730> but<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.150> doesn't<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.480> matter<00:02:44.690> if

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
up but it doesn't really matter if

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.890 
up but it doesn't really matter if
you're<00:02:45.290> honest<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.540> personal

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
you're honest it's just a personal

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.990 
you're honest it's just a personal
preference<00:02:48.109> I<00:02:48.440> guess<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.310> I've<00:02:49.790> done

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
preference I guess it's just I've done

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.340 
preference I guess it's just I've done
it<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> few<00:02:50.180> times<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.750> kind<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.959> went<00:02:51.140> for

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
it a few times so just kind of went for

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.530 
it a few times so just kind of went for
it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
it

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.940 
it
so<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:53.989> what<00:02:54.109> I'm<00:02:54.170> doing<00:02:54.650> or<00:02:54.829> you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
so you can do what I'm doing or you

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.910 
so you can do what I'm doing or you
could<00:02:55.100> actually<00:02:55.190> follow<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.609> instructions

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
could actually follow the instructions

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750 
could actually follow the instructions
so<00:02:57.920> yeah<00:02:59.799> even<00:03:00.799> though<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> added<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.519> lot

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so yeah even though I added like a lot

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.670 
so yeah even though I added like a lot
of<00:03:01.790> water<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.660> dyes<00:03:02.840> were<00:03:03.079> still<00:03:03.350> really

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
of water the dyes were still really

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.740 
of water the dyes were still really
really<00:03:03.890> dark<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.549> if<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.090> do<00:03:05.359> want<00:03:05.570> like<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
really dark so if you do want like a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.460 
really dark so if you do want like a
pastel<00:03:06.320> color<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:07.150> definitely<00:03:08.150> suggest<00:03:08.470> tiny

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
pastel color I definitely suggest tiny

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.229 
pastel color I definitely suggest tiny
tiny<00:03:09.829> amount<00:03:10.190> over<00:03:10.400> dye<00:03:10.700> because<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.090> could

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
tiny amount over dye because you could

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.539 
tiny amount over dye because you could
always<00:03:11.359> add<00:03:11.690> add<00:03:12.140> more<00:03:12.859> in<00:03:13.070> but<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> can't

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
always add add more in but you can't

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.560 
always add add more in but you can't
take<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:14.000> sir<00:03:14.329> yeah

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.420 

yes<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:21.870> I'm<00:03:22.020> just<00:03:22.230> shaking<00:03:22.950> everything

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
yes so now I'm just shaking everything

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.980 
yes so now I'm just shaking everything
up<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.820> make<00:03:24.000> sure<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.240> mixture<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.630> all<00:03:24.780> good

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
up and make sure the mixture is all good

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.260 
up and make sure the mixture is all good
along<00:03:25.260> with<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.500> salt<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.010> spraying<00:03:26.550> out<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
along with a salt and spraying out to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.240 
along with a salt and spraying out to
test<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:28.320> working<00:03:28.830> okay<00:03:30.890> okay<00:03:31.890> now<00:03:32.040> I'm<00:03:32.190> just

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
test it's working okay okay now I'm just

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.940 
test it's working okay okay now I'm just
placing<00:03:32.640> down<00:03:33.000> my<00:03:33.690> t-shirt<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
placing down my t-shirt this is the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.390 
placing down my t-shirt this is the
crumpled<00:03:35.520> effect<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.540> whole<00:03:37.400> part

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
crumpled effect this is the whole part

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.760 
crumpled effect this is the whole part
of<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.610> tutorial

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
of the tutorial

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.080 
of the tutorial
simply<00:03:40.770> literally<00:03:41.550> just<00:03:41.700> placing<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
simply literally just placing the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.640 
simply literally just placing the
t-shirt<00:03:42.420> down<00:03:42.540> crumbling<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.320> together

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
t-shirt down crumbling it together

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.250 
t-shirt down crumbling it together
creates<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.240> like<00:03:45.450> some<00:03:45.750> white

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
creates like you have like some white

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
creates like you have like some white
spaces<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.510> obviously<00:03:48.510> colored<00:03:49.500> spaces<00:03:49.980> so
