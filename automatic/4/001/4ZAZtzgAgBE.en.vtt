00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
wasn't serving a purpose so I was

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
wasn't serving a purpose so I was
kicking<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.590> day<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> Sun<00:01:32.369> was

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
