00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.700

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.009
 that have brought us in the hairdressing salon 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 means work have brought us furnaces 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.500
 range of new dyes that has taken 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.970
 salerm cosmetics so we can try it 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.989
 so I would like to teach oslo because 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.920
 I see it interesting is this box where 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.920
 8 dyes come 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.260
 these dyes as you can see are 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:55.010
 pretty flashy and pretty the funny thing 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.030
 of these dyes it is that you are not clear 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.560
 you put the product and let it dry 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.110
 you wear it with your hair completely 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.000
 clean but you put it in the area where 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.790
 you want and want to make tufts if 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 you want to make colored tips if 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.120
 you want to make your bangs 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.400
 you put in that area that lets it dry 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 until it is completely dry when 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.210
 be completely dry you have to 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.450
 comb and leave but you do not have to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.729
 clarify for nothing the teeth are already 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.740
 they go to the 23 washes depends on the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.950
 porosity you have on good hair 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 The colors that we have in this box are 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.399
 what is a first is the coral color is 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 a mixture between red or orange but it's 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.820
 very beautiful we have this pink the pink 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.360
 that is super nice is with the rose 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.060
 chewing gum so very very cool then 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.460
 we have the number 3 from the bayern pro 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.549
 open as you see the product I've 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.210
 seen as an electric flower not blue 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:02.200
 electrical electric but good 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.270
 the color 4 also comes from the blue 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.050
 that this one is beautiful 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.940
 it's like a blue does not make a title the no 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.709
 it is super super super live that gives us 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.830
 number 5 we have the gray color which is a 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.480
 green so a little dark but but 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.300
 It is also very beautiful 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.870
 number 6 we have the bronx that is like a 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.790
 golden bronze so beautiful 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.700
 I do not know when I open they have as 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.080
 crime at number 7 we have a coffee 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.740
 chocolate 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.160
 in number 8 we have the black that is 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.010
 a black now I will teach you how to put 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.930
 I recommend this product if you have 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.150
 all the blond color to put you 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.400
 alone at home is because these colors 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.560
 stain very fast and catch very fast in 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 a hair so blond then yes without 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.570
 want to love you like that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.420
 and you stain and afterwards then that you 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.310
 help another person and that you put it 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.130
 already as in my case they are going to put it on me 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.740
 but I'm going to show you how they do it and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.110
 all the steps that must be done if 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.140
 you have for example this part of 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.930
 hair of a color and then the tips 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.630
 of red and you are going to put in that 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.980
 piece of colorado the colors yes that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.750
 You can do it alone at home 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.790
 because then there is no risk of 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.010
 stain the other part because although 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.580
 Manches the other part of the banks 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.580
 well then 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.220
 no no 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.360
 all right 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.229
 and 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.020
 and 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:10.130
 As you can see, it is not the result that 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:13.430
 I was waiting for me like green 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.500
 green water very strange to see and expected 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.130
 that you have left me a blue color 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.860
 very beautiful smurf but the reality is 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.780
 that I have left the green hair that 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.930
 let's do when I was getting 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:31.070
 the product and it's going pretty well 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.050
 the color that I saw I liked but the 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.460
 product had to be allowed to dry and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.810
 then comb it with 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.479
 brush dried out impossible or not 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.259
 you could comb that that had been done 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:51.380
 hard pasta wants to pass the 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.169
 dryer with the brush then what 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.990
 in the end I had to do it has been 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.470
 clarify my hair and the color that has 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.599
 it has been this one the truth is that 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.880
 they came out cosmetics has a lot 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.639
 very good products but I think that in 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.340
 this has not accepted at all as an idea and 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.930
 it's fine but then in the execution 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.270
 because the truth is that I do not know no time 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.949
 in the box and such did not come 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.690
 instructions or anything what I had to 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.280
 search online for kids 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.940
