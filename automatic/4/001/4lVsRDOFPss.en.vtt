00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 Y 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.110
 Oh, what's up with my YouTube people like 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.850
 are I hope that very very very well they 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.110
 talk about inter tutorials and good 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.630
 I always bring them out an excellent 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.950
 tutorial and today I bring you a video and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.200
 that many people have told me 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.870
 some doubts that have had of how 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.580
 record the xbox 360 games without 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.540
 no kind of problem then what 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.640
 first thing I'm going to tell you is 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.420
 mainly that the console this 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.350
 fail to have the lt 3.0 that's what they 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 I recommend that you have the 3.0 lt 3.0 for 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.160
 that can play the latest games without 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960
 no problem because the versions 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.570
 before, you have to have more steps 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.000
 in changing this is only to use it and the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.299
 lt 3.0 and record the game without major 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.880
 problem then first that the console 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.920
 have the flash and second buy these 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.530
 divided of double layer that are in 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.140
 capacity of 8.5 gigabytes I recommend 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.400
 the verbatim and the ls here does not recommend 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 no other because he has not tried 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 more but personally less than they are 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.340
 and any other recognized brand of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.350
 be good but I recommend all 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.820
 then once this is done, 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.520
 next step is to download 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.580
 in this case that I want to download with 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 important the grand theft auto 5 that is 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 xdg 3 which are the last of the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.430
 last that are coming out 2013-2014 that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.650
 is let's say a new format to say it 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.780
 so this one that says we split why 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.550
 because it is that it weighs 15 gb I know that they 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.950
 to bring the divided that every two in 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.050
 two parts that each one is going to record 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.970
 in a different divided without any 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.009
 problem this region frei that because the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.150
 that we are here of North American 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.070
 center and south 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.170
 we should mostly use these region end 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.780
 or any other except those who say 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.229
 because those who say bread are the ones who 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.659
 They use in Asia and a part of Europe then 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 we are here in america the vast majority 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:16.030
 of our consoles are brought from 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.830
 then we do not have any 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.690
 problem in using these but the pallets 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.040
 they will not serve us then so 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.409
 lose lives and not waste time 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.790
 downloading games that are pallets in 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.129
 this game we are going to download now 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.569
 we are here to download torrents and then 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.819
 we wait for it to download it is 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.129
 depending on each person the connection 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.569
 to internet that has then already one time 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.430
 done this what we are going to do is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.260
 having the lt of three points in our 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.239
 console we will not need this 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.120
 little program that was the one that we had to 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.980
 Patch the start of the game with each 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.959
 wave so that our control what 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.510
 could read without any problem of 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.489
 stress is no longer used anymore it goes away and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.980
 then we fight here to the trash can 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.359
 recycling without any without any 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.269
 problem this what we are going to do is 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.819
 use only this program in old age 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.500
 x 360 we are going to open it but here I in 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.060
 this moment and put these all these 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.190
 eyelashes have to have a 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.660
 special configuration at this time 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.640
 not only to explain why in this 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.849
 moment a link will appear in the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.930
 screen that will take us to the video in 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.220
 where he explained step by step how 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.870
 configure it perfectly to be able to 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.900
 record it normally also the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.760
 description of the video is the link for 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.169
 that they go and see the video and do not have 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.910
 no problem how to use this 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.220
 program to record your but is 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.569
 once used this little program what 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.579
 let's do is use 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.190
 obviously our burner let's see 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.470
 the imgburn program this is here and what 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.049
 we open this it is better to download the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.790
 latest version without any problem and 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.410
 here the other question that a lot of people 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.690
 has is that if we have to have a 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.790
 special burn the lite-on are the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.380
 the ones that are already fixed are the ones 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.269
 for the islands they sell in places 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.760
 specialized that the flash already has 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.250
 to record games at 100 percent 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.099
 of these x's of g3 but these are some 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.290
 burns that are not lite-on but 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.359
 they record the games between a cake 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.220
 so the game is going to be almost 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.760
 maximum of the cid 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.040
 but not 100% 97 98 percent of 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.930
 please but it 's completely playable 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.359
 without any kind of problem then 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.090
 once opened this here we go 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.850
 then here the configuration is us 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.410
 we go to the wright tab and what 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.540
 let's do is here choose 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.190
 mainly morel calculate and optimal 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.070
 So what we are going to do is that he 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.500
 only the program will use the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.300
 just calculate what you think is 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.920
 the best option to record the game with 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
 this number because some people 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.550
 You can also be here to give in this 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.220
 second option that the user does not 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.470
 specify the number and for these 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.480
 games xdg 3 is 21 33 52 0 that's the 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.580
 number to use but then also 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.220
 can write it or leave it here in the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.890
 first tab machines we give you more ok 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.480
 the brand in the first option and then 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.150
 here what to do here we are going to look for the 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.660
 DVD point file of folders 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.480
 where 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.540
 rope 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.430
 without downloading that because he should see 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.590
 that weighs a lot less than the point 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.300
 he did because he is the file that brings 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.790
 all the indications to record the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.160
 game the iso could also be finished 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.320
 but in this case that I am 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.570
 explaining this method let's give the 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.460
 point of bds the file the point of vd 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.500
 in case when you just 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.180
 download the game see that the file 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.760
 dvd does not exist is not in your folder 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.430
 quiet when using this program to bg x 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.110
 360 that program creates that file for 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.820
 that you do not have any problems and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.850
 can record their games like this great 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.830
 game and everyone who comes in 2014 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.110
 fifa and any other game that follow 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.760
 generating will aggravate the five 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.590
 controls 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.700
 once to each selected point 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.130
 you must already know it here, they choose 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.940
 depending on it is that they have here 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.890
 give in 2 x 2 4 x here a single copy and 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.860
 here that does not have this here perfect and 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.320
 here is this option is going to leave 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.380
 color equipment stably frame and 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.690
 black because when there is no divine 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.690
 and there is no one without dividing in the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.040
 tray in this way then here this does not 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.290
 it is color because there is nothing with it 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.420
 where to burn where to record some 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.370
 file document class then 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.390
 you know they give you here click they are going to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.190
 appear a message is a new window 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.080
 of message where will you say that if you 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.670
 they want there are the options of prints you 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.560
 they are going to choose the option where it says from 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.750
 Kate there is a bit in English and that 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.790
 but there in parentheses where it says 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.600
 that this option is what you click 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.430
 click on the bony option fill the in the 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.070
 chulito but not here but where it says 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.139
 true kate they give in ok and ready they wait for 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.659
 what is serious 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:51.219
 100% games and ready now only 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.840
 insert your game into your console and 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:55.749
 start enjoying these wonders 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.449
 well without spending a lot very much 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.860
 money because they vary in each country 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.319
 the prices but then here in my country 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.360
 quite expensive enough games come out 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:07.270
 originals and then the only one 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.909
 disadvantage is to be able to join the live 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.550
 Calderón live walk but the rest that 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.289
 it is already in the background in terms of 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.150
 enjoy it then well my people 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.560

 very clear how to record these games but 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.560
 however if they have any kind of 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.810
 doubt that abajito in the comments 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.599
