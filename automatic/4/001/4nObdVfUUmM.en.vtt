00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.300
 but moussa we find everywhere in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.370
 everyday life 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 shaving foam chocolate mousse 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 the entertainer the beer actually is it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.949
 something that looks very common but in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 done it's pretty complicated and everything 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.730
 lies in the properties of what we 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 calls attention active and old 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.460
 assets these are molecules that comes 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.230
 to get to the surface is here what 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
 we're going to see we're going from the drop 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 which element the simplest and one in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 was coming up to the moss for you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 show how this time on assets 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.640
 allow to carve his objects enough 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.640
 strange 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.379
 donate king or bone was something 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.059
 very simple that the smallest unit of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.079
 fluids that can be considered but 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.909
 it's so small in fact that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.899
 enjoy the grotesque are not enough to 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.850
 explain the gout it is also necessary 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.079
 consider the surface then if we 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.030
 deposit for example on a plate of 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.920
 glass the drop simply she spreads 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.629
 so it is often seen on 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.059
 full noise now if we drop it 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.199
 its hydrophobic glass surfaces the ball 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.519
 shape small beads 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.229
 because the surface is hydrophobic and 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.580
 no they do not want to spread 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.950
 so we see that the natural form 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.060
 of a drop is rather a sphere the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.680
 rice if I was going to quickly reach 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.789
 acoustic that is to say that between the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.830
 two metal parts 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.289
 there is a stationary acoustic 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.340
 which is generated and so that's actually 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.319
 there are three little traps in which 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 I can go drop a drop then 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.899
 I dropped a drop of water on the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.610
 small the little trap of the middle and we 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.929
 see that this drop the water will go 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.580
 quickly and we see how much this strong 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.959
 naturally strict so now if 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 I'm adding dishwashing liquids 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.929
 so surfactants to this drop 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.509
 water or change the properties of 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.520
 surface that is to say that the surface of 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.170
 the water is going to be more deformable is in 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.149
 Indeed I now look gout 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 with dishwashing liquid we see 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.610
 that it crashes in the manner of small 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.610
 of 9 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.120
 the surfactants you want that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.220
 surfactants this is what we find in 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.420
 dishwashing products so the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.890
 connivances they are used to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.060
 to degrease because these molecules of 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.130
 surfactants that make getting in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560
 surface can better clean the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.450
 dishes and so we will use this 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.450
 property of surfactants to form a 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.190
 soap film so in this bottle 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.920
 I have dishwashing victims out of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
 this bottle sort of nylon thread 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.890
 I'm going to run the liquid along 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 of his two nylon threads which has 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.280
 abandoned we will discard the films of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.120
 the union to form a great film of 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.640
 sword so that actually shows that the the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.800
 add a little bit 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.700
 a few drops are enough it's true 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.410
 it's a little bit of surfactants 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.940
 it completely changes the properties of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.190
 water in that of being able to form 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.590
 liquid films so a soap film 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's interesting because if we follow 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.520
 will follow to make bubbles and if 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.790
 takes a lot of bubbles and well we have a 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.980
 foam 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.050
 here we have a little experience that in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.600
 zooms in on the intersection of 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.740
 several bubbles so I'm going to do 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.740
 mount the little movie 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.110
 as if we had 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.180
 several cities that met and 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.160
 so his misguided form of movie plans 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.860
 soap that meet in effect 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.900
 phil here called plateau 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.430
 it's a fact liquid channel through which 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.170
 the liquid will be drained ie 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.940
 that because of the gravity of liquid is going 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.160
 go down we will join the rest 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.170
 of container is actually the properties 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.870
 physical of this thin wire is going indeed 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.130
 determine the stability of the foam 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.690
 next we want a us that holds 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.790
 long or not long it will take 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.930
 play on stage the flows in this 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.250
 bouquet channel today as leaving 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.569
 of nadÃ¨ge sap like the drop 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 there is less to make films from 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.750
 soap to part and finish have 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.310
 through partial sweaters and a lot of 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.540
 bubbles we can have a foam and 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.920
 that a foam makes it into aspects 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.049
 very simple it is something very 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.819
 complex and physics and chemistry 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.580
 he can even imagine biology 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.720
 with organic molecules is in 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.430
 makes a better understanding of these 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.630
 mosses will have walls 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.750
 of applications in the life of all 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.750
 days
