00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 so this is the 3 series and today we will 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480
 experiment with dynamite 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.760
 let's not talk for long let's go 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.300
 get down to business directly to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.300
 experiments 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 so these are the first experiments and now we 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.290
 try to figure out whose explosion is more powerful 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.419
 creeper or blog and dynamite us here 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.180
 four skeletons they stand at a distance 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:32.019
 one to four blocks now we 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:37.150
 blow up dynamite and see what damage it is 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:41.489
 will cause this skeleton and so the first conclusion 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.489
 all four skeletons are destroyed immediately 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.650
 continue experiments this time 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.420
 instead of dynamite explosion creeper you see 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 distance is the same skeletons 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.090
 all the same things are the same now 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.400
 instead of dynamite blow my creeper 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.280
 assistant now he provokes a gap and 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:06.340
 let's see how many skeletons will survive after 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.670
 a blast but you see if one amide killed 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.820
 immediately 4 then here two you lived they 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.009
 suffered great damage but nonetheless 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 obviously dynamite is more powerful 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:25.539
 more powerful than a creeper the boys are still regatta 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.509
 Come on now, we examine the theory that 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.460
 what if between a player and a dynamite block 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.830
 and the wall of any block is big 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.080
 part of the throne most of the green yourself 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.600
 It takes this wall now we 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.980
 blow my friend my colleague will write 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 how much health does he have 2 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.180
 you see it's true he survived then 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.070
 there is a wall at least took part 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:54.080
 colleagueâ€™s damage is 10 days left 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.650
 health it means that the wall takes 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.000
 most of the damage on yourself and so for 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.690
 what actually needed this 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.520
 experiment you must understand that if 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.160
 was going to blow someone up there between 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.190
 player or mobs should not be 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.770
 no obstacles otherwise living from 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.850
 any block will take most damage 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.850
 on themselves and in general the effects will not be 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.500
 boys all guys 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.710
 okay in the third experiment we will check 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.230
 the theory is that if around dynamite 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.020
 there is no block of air due to the explosion 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.470
 it will turn out perfectly even and correct 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.240
 space and hermetically sealed 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.990
 dynamite and now let's see what will happen 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.990
 if you blow 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.900
 see what happened as you can see 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.510
 perfectly flat space is not very 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.420
 exactly and clearly and the main reason is still 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.760
 tell it is that you 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.760
 twist us you didn't have air blocks 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.860
 the same can be done with less 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.700
 designs still tell the main thing to 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.820
 dynamite was isolated then due to 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.290
 the explosion will make a perfectly smooth funnel 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.290
 and if I may say so 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.170
 3 series ended 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 and I hope you learned something new from 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.879
 dynamics of its properties if you 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.780
 liked our series do not forget 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:48.220
 subscribe and somehow comment 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.220
 I hope to see you in the next series
