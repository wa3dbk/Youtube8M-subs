I'm stupid haha but anyways Rotom killed
my<00:03:28.870> Landers<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.319> go<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> t<00:03:29.709> tard<00:03:29.950> pursued<00:03:30.340> him

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
my Landers I go to t tard pursued him

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.650 
my Landers I go to t tard pursued him
except<00:03:30.639> figured<00:03:30.880> he<00:03:30.940> would<00:03:31.060> switch<00:03:31.209> out<00:03:31.359> even

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
except figured he would switch out even

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.970 
except figured he would switch out even
though<00:03:31.720> he<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:31.930> most<00:03:32.170> likely<00:03:32.380> locked<00:03:32.739> into

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
though he is most likely locked into

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.099 
though he is most likely locked into
hydro<00:03:33.250> pump<00:03:33.370> or<00:03:33.790> something<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.750> it's

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
hydro pump or something like that it's

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.330 
hydro pump or something like that it's
like<00:03:35.170> they're<00:03:35.590> still<00:03:35.799> good<00:03:35.980> chance<00:03:36.190> he<00:03:36.280> would

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
like they're still good chance he would

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.500 
like they're still good chance he would
switch<00:03:36.579> because<00:03:36.790> he<00:03:37.060> doesn't<00:03:37.209> want<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.420> take

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
switch because he doesn't want to take

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.660 
switch because he doesn't want to take
him<00:03:37.630> from<00:03:37.750> teeter<00:03:38.049> which<00:03:38.260> worked<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:39.430> then

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
him from teeter which worked but then

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.860 
him from teeter which worked but then
goes<00:03:39.850> in<00:03:39.970> god<00:03:40.120> man<00:03:40.299> i<00:03:40.329> switched<00:03:40.540> out<00:03:40.660> her<00:03:40.750> own

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
goes in god man i switched out her own

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.420

doubles out to his politoed yeah now i
just<00:03:47.470> paint<00:03:47.799> split<00:03:48.040> cuz<00:03:48.340> i<00:03:48.579> know<00:03:48.760> i<00:03:48.880> could<00:03:49.060> take

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
just paint split cuz i know i could take

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.750 
just paint split cuz i know i could take
any<00:03:49.359> hit<00:03:49.510> brings<00:03:49.989> back<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.350> Celebi<00:03:50.799> which<00:03:51.519> is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
any hit brings back in Celebi which is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.000 
any hit brings back in Celebi which is
cool<00:03:52.000> because<00:03:52.180> what<00:03:52.389> I<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.569> do<00:03:52.630> here<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.079> go

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
cool because what I can do here is go

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.309 
cool because what I can do here is go
back<00:03:54.099> into<00:03:54.280> T<00:03:54.489> tar<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.940> he<00:03:55.930> actually<00:03:56.049> goes<00:03:56.260> to

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
back into T tar and he actually goes to

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.420 
back into T tar and he actually goes to
recover<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.799> there<00:03:56.889> I<00:03:56.950> know<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.160> could<00:03:57.250> take<00:03:57.370> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
recover it there I know it could take a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.670 
recover it there I know it could take a
Giga<00:03:57.730> Drain<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.510> case<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.170> wanted<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.530> go

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
Giga Drain but in case you wanted to go

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.030 
Giga Drain but in case you wanted to go
for<00:04:00.420> whatever<00:04:01.420> he<00:04:01.930> wanted<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.620> know<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.829> could

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
for whatever he wanted to I know I could

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.220

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
take it cuz of the sand and here it

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.479 
take it cuz of the sand and here it
makes<00:04:05.349> a<00:04:05.470> dump<00:04:05.620> life<00:04:05.769> going<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.190> turn

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489

what<00:04:10.930> but<00:04:11.079> pursuit<00:04:11.380> just<00:04:11.590> takes<00:04:11.769> them

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
what but pursuit just takes them

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.939 
with but I don't have outraged which
kind<00:05:56.690> of<00:05:56.720> sucks<00:05:56.960> but<00:05:57.260> at<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.530> very<00:05:57.560> least<00:05:57.710> I

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
kind of sucks but at the very least I

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.950 
kind of sucks but at the very least I
get<00:05:58.130> a<00:05:58.159> good<00:05:58.370> dragon<00:05:58.580> cough<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:59.240> break<00:05:59.630> his<00:05:59.750> sub

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
get a good dragon cough to break his sub

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.320 
get a good dragon cough to break his sub
and<00:06:00.080> then<00:06:00.169> he<00:06:00.229> switches<00:06:00.470> out<00:06:00.880> right<00:06:01.880> there<00:06:02.060> but

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
and then he switches out right there but

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.210 
and then he switches out right there but
I<00:06:02.360> mean<00:06:02.539> he<00:06:03.349> took<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.620> rough<00:06:03.770> skin<00:06:03.949> and<00:06:04.070> rocky

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
I mean he took the rough skin and rocky

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.760 
I mean he took the rough skin and rocky
helmet<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:04.909> I<00:06:05.150> guess<00:06:05.630> it's<00:06:05.780> kind<00:06:05.930> of<00:06:05.960> why<00:06:06.110> but

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
helmet so I guess it's kind of why but

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.170 
helmet so I guess it's kind of why but
he<00:06:06.830> brings<00:06:06.979> in<00:06:07.130> politoed<00:06:07.460> her<00:06:07.580> here<00:06:07.760> I<00:06:07.789> didn't

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
he brings in politoed her here I didn't

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.899 
he brings in politoed her here I didn't
know<00:06:08.240> he<00:06:08.330> was<00:06:08.419> scarfed<00:06:08.810> yet<00:06:08.960> but<00:06:09.520> so<00:06:10.520> that's

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
know he was scarfed yet but so that's

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.580 
know he was scarfed yet but so that's
why<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.120> tried<00:06:11.419> saying<00:06:11.659> just<00:06:11.990> earthquake<00:06:12.349> but<00:06:12.530> I

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
why I tried saying just earthquake but I

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.010 
why I tried saying just earthquake but I
bring<00:06:12.770> in<00:06:12.889> keldeo<00:06:13.190> now<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:14.270> just<00:06:14.449> try<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:14.780> get

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
bring in keldeo now to just try and get

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.689 
bring in keldeo now to just try and get
off<00:06:15.139> some<00:06:15.380> damage<00:06:15.710> on<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:15.919> thing<00:06:16.099> plus<00:06:16.430> I

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
off some damage on the thing plus I

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.339 
off some damage on the thing plus I
figured<00:06:17.570> he<00:06:17.720> would<00:06:17.810> just<00:06:17.900> switch<00:06:17.990> out<00:06:18.229> right

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
figured he would just switch out right

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.750 
figured he would just switch out right
here<00:06:18.500> so<00:06:18.680> i<00:06:18.740> just<00:06:18.770> go<00:06:19.010> from<00:06:19.099> hydro<00:06:19.370> pump<00:06:19.490> and

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
here so i just go from hydro pump and

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.450 
here so i just go from hydro pump and
does<00:06:20.270> take<00:06:20.449> out<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.630> gengar<00:06:20.930> obviously<00:06:21.770> but

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
does take out the gengar obviously but

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.159 
does take out the gengar obviously but
now<00:06:22.550> he's<00:06:22.669> getting<00:06:22.729> on<00:06:22.940> gyarados<00:06:23.419> and<00:06:24.080> I'm

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
now he's getting on gyarados and I'm

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.480 
now he's getting on gyarados and I'm
like<00:06:24.289> okay<00:06:24.620> I<00:06:24.650> can<00:06:24.889> hydro<00:06:25.130> pump<00:06:25.250> right<00:06:25.400> here

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
like okay I can hydro pump right here

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.550 
like okay I can hydro pump right here
he's<00:06:25.880> probably<00:06:26.270> since<00:06:26.930> he's<00:06:27.050> got<00:06:27.199> sub<00:06:27.409> he's

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
he's probably since he's got sub he's

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.920 
he's probably since he's got sub he's
gonna<00:06:27.650> have<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.889> bounce<00:06:28.159> so<00:06:29.150> I'm<00:06:29.720> gonna

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
gonna have the bounce so I'm gonna

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.689 
gonna have the bounce so I'm gonna
predict<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.349> bounce<00:06:30.500> go<00:06:30.919> for<00:06:31.070> hydro<00:06:31.280> pump<00:06:31.430> and

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
predict the bounce go for hydro pump and

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.190 
predict the bounce go for hydro pump and
the<00:06:32.090> other<00:06:32.330> bounce<00:06:32.510> i<00:06:32.690> can<00:06:32.840> switch<00:06:32.960> out<00:06:33.080> to

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
the other bounce i can switch out to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.980 
the other bounce i can switch out to
jirachi<00:06:33.500> take<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.610> set<00:06:34.820> bounce<00:06:35.090> and<00:06:35.479> i<00:06:35.810> can

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
jirachi take the set bounce and i can

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.480 
jirachi take the set bounce and i can
hit<00:06:36.110> him<00:06:36.200> with<00:06:36.320> a<00:06:36.380> grass<00:06:36.560> not<00:06:36.830> because<00:06:37.310> i<00:06:37.430> think

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
hit him with a grass not because i think

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.290 
hit him with a grass not because i think
that'll<00:06:37.940> be<00:06:37.969> enough

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
that'll be enough

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.580 
that'll be enough
to<00:06:38.389> take<00:06:38.569> him<00:06:38.690> down<00:06:38.720> if<00:06:38.960> he<00:06:39.020> decided<00:06:39.319> to<00:06:39.379> go<00:06:39.470> to

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590
