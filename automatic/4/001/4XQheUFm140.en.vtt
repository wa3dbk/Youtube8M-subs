as a green place always realign o'clock

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
as a green place always realign o'clock
only<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> position<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.840> maximum

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
only in this position you have maximum

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
only in this position you have maximum
steering<00:01:37.230> angle<00:01:37.650> available<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> over

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
steering angle available so the over

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.240 
steering angle available so the over
three<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> nine<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.830> I<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.130> need

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060 
three and nine and what I don't need
more<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.330> usually<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.410> shift

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
more and usually I don't have to shift

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
more and usually I don't have to shift
over<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.910> hands<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.480> only<00:01:45.750> three<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.260> nine<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
over my hands is only three at nine and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
over my hands is only three at nine and
always<00:01:47.670> try<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.000> push<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.750> wheel<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.380> pull

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
always try to push the wheel not to pull

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
always try to push the wheel not to pull
it<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.550> go<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.330> it's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.930> left

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it so when I go to the right it's a left

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590 
it so when I go to the right it's a left
hand<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> steering<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.400> not<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> right

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
hand which is pulling because when I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.140 
hand which is pulling because when I
have<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.760> push<00:01:57.630> position<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.610> press

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
have the push position then I press

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.760 
have the push position then I press
myself<00:02:00.540> into<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.900> seat<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.590> view

everything
it<00:02:06.990> doesn't<00:02:07.260> need<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.590> much<00:02:07.800> speed<00:02:08.130> it's<00:02:08.399> more

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it doesn't need so much speed it's more

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
it doesn't need so much speed it's more
the<00:02:09.030> ability<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.380> little<00:02:10.560> bit<00:02:10.740> patient

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the ability to be a little bit patient

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.270 
the ability to be a little bit patient

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you automatically where it wants to go

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.460 
you automatically where it wants to go
to<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:16.080> dusting<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.070> wait<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.420> and

to your dusting the time to wait for and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.830 
to your dusting the time to wait for and
many<00:02:19.470> people<00:02:19.800> don't<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.750> patience<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
many people don't have the patience to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
wait for the car reaction so I know a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280 
wait for the car reaction so I know a
steer<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.330> left<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.870> takes<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.260> few

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
steer to the left and it takes a few

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.460 
steer to the left and it takes a few
seconds<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.820> car<00:02:27.090> turns<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.570> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
seconds and then the car turns in it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.440 
seconds and then the car turns in it's
the<00:02:28.530> same<00:02:28.830> when<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.700> shift<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.090> when<00:02:30.330> you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the same when you shift up when you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.540 
the same when you shift up when you
change<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> load<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> steer<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.160> now

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
change the load I steer to the right now

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.820 
change the load I steer to the right now
and<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.420> takes<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.780> short<00:02:34.140> second<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
and then it takes a short second and the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.120 
and then it takes a short second and the
car<00:02:35.010> comes<00:02:35.570> also<00:02:36.570> when<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.870> play<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.650> bottle

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
car comes also when you play with bottle

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.520 
car comes also when you play with bottle
time<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> throttle<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.630> go<00:02:39.840> off<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.350> load

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
time on the throttle I go off the load

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
time on the throttle I go off the load
is<00:02:40.680> changing<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.910> car<00:02:42.090> starts<00:02:42.420> turning

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
is changing and the car starts turning

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.809 
is changing and the car starts turning
so

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.839 
so
with<00:02:44.780> balance<00:02:45.319> try<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> way<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
with balance try to get the way to the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.479 
with balance try to get the way to the
front<00:02:47.469> try<00:02:48.469> to<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.739> more<00:02:48.950> pressure<00:02:49.219> on<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
front try to get more pressure on the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.360 
front try to get more pressure on the
front<00:02:49.760> wheels<00:02:50.109> that<00:02:51.109> we<00:02:51.439> have<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.950> chance<00:02:52.189> to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
front wheels that we have the chance to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:45.730 
front wheels that we have the chance to
bring<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.609> car<00:02:52.790> around

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740
