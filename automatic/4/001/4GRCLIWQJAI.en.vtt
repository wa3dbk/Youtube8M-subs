00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:18.400
 good i am quiksilver we are here in the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.349
 episode 51 of Kuyt Mode and today I bring you 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.210
 a bot that did not prevent much so I say 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.759
 well let's do him the favor and I'll 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.669
 I bring good in you is called 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.859
 hosty fine is worth and is a mod that before 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.110
 teach it consists of a way to 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.829
 increase the performance of minecraft is 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.800
 say in download the graphics of the game 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.379
 to do better or upload them according to 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.760
 the order you have is worth good for 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.010
 get to your menu we have to give them 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.420
 video adjustment options and simply 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 add more things here I'm going to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.530
 try to explain finish a bit like that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.510
 but let's go first we're going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 configure it as if we were like that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 if we had the minecraft 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.820
 with very poor quality and if we do not have 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.129
 ordered to endure what is the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 most of the cases which we are going to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.310
 reduce its power let's go here we have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.020
 what to put in fast is worth if they are 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.520
 detailed vouchers have to put it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.360
 childhood in fast say fast let's go 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 it is and that we have to put it in fps 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 maximum is worth what it is worth to say lame 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.149
 maximum power this leaves the same leaves 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.960
 same as you want but I saw the same 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.960
 shine as you want 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.429
 and well this is the distance I 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.560
 we could here is worth but good we 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.509
 leave them in team and it's worth it 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.729
 if we are going to put it in team and we are going to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.000
 set the example look at an example how 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.660
 It would look 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.970
 You see you do not see a poop but like this or I would go 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.970
 much faster very much 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 I'm going to leave it 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.540
 we have because I'm doing well 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 but good now we go here that has 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 that putting it in multicolored would be what 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.810
 maximum in default is how it comes normal 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.060
 current and it's very for the fps 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.950
 have a steady brave pace and that 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.950
 you can leave what I already leave like that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.480
 normal vale 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.480
 and that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.300
 this video has spent only a little 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.970
 always on top 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.910
 this has to put it in phase so that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.270
 go faster then this you have to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.270
 put it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.049
 002 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.160
 if you leave it 0 2 it would be enough even if that 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.050
 does not affect much but good 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.200
 today we are going to see performances that 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.260
 they saw details 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.890
 these are the main trees come out 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 a fast and load with the leaves 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.910
 transparent with the other you know that the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.950
 normal the sun 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.770
 if they give less the transparent islands give 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.520
 more without that you leave Paul all 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.130
 you put it in fas everything since it is farc 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.630
 it gets faster because it takes away enough 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.630
 takes away this can put everything on off 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.160
 this removes the rains and the snow removes 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.900
 the star remove her and stupid with this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.910
 everything will go much faster because 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.550
 well I'm throwing things things 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.480
 real 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 the quality 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.480
 well this is just also like 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.760
 we were so you can leave it to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.530
 good animations this I do not recommend 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.530
 remove them but you can remove for example 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.010
 those of water 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.300
 of alan of the fire also but 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.510
 neither take everything away because if the 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.270
 remove and everything is going to be something weird look 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.580
 to take everything 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.500
 let's put all this in a bad case and 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.170
 although this recommends not removing it 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.250
 because they are the animations vouchers are going to 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.250
 look pretty weird 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.950
 but let's catch water 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 from this community 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.739
 but for example the lavas you see 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.739
 fixedly 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.410
 You see the fixed thing look 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.880
 it's as if it were an image stuck there and 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.880
 If we go to the water, look at the equator 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.400
 this is but this is what I am 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.740
 rendering a thing we are here 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.120
 look further and here set as 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.130
 it looks like it's a sticker that 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.400
 they have put here no I do not know is not left 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.650
 all good 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.250
 I do not like the truth adjustment options 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.800
 video is not blamed you have to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.440
 they left increase equal this yes yes that 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.699
 you have to put it in a so that they are 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.699
 the stable fps 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:55.090
 it's worth this you have to put it 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.090
 in off so that the 81 is recharge 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.820
 here it is 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.880
 It is very good to work 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.130
 off and not see this is important 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.700
 that you have with him in 30 minutes so that 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:13.000
 the world be saved every enough time 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.040
 and the digital thing is already 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.310
 water here and that 's it but the others 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.680
 so far what I recommend is worth 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.720
 for this mod but I highly recommend 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.460
 is the ma jin launcher that is in the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.150
 corner on the right will be prohibited 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.710
 and positions above because there is a 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.240
 launcher that there is alternative to 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.970
 minecraft only for prizes 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.590
 I'm sorry one of the advantages of having 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.800
 premium is not that what you imagine 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.090
 but they are advantages because it has the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.610
 advantage of using the launcher that 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.940
 we support has as a motorcycle base and 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.350
 it also removes a lot much much more so 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.720
 I recommend it 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:54.240
 well then the team failures as 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.240
 explained is a way that is to improve 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.080
 or does not improve the syndrome improve it is 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.120
 add or remove graphics with the most 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.789
 graphics more slower training 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.710
 at least faster graphs like this 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.350
 that you can pretty much configure as 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.750
 If you take everything away, it will go more 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.150
 fast if you put everything and projected 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.710
 to the top then go more if you have a 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.509
 computer gives you the same but if you do not go and 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.880
 slower but it also goes there all the more 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.550
 nice the distance much farther so 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.740
 that you already choose, I hope there 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.389
 liked the mod let live favorites 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.130
 subscribe and see you next 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.130
 goodbye episode
