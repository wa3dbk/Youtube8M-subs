00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.809 
is just what they're gonna look like I
think<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:43.019> will<00:02:43.260> probably<00:02:43.560> change<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.580> because

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
think I will probably change it because

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.240 
think I will probably change it because
I<00:02:44.850> feel<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.590> part<00:02:46.890> looks

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250

too<00:02:47.489> much<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:47.700> Kiwi<00:02:48.239> KJ's<00:02:48.690> adventure<00:02:49.170> rounds

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
too much like Kiwi KJ's adventure rounds

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.360 
too much like Kiwi KJ's adventure rounds
