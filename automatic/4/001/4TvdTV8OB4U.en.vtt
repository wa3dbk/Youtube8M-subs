today I'm gonna show a small update on
this<00:00:19.900> Tesla<00:00:20.900> coil<00:00:21.320> set<00:00:21.740> all<00:00:21.890> mine<00:00:22.840> everything

this Tesla coil set all mine everything

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.470 
this Tesla coil set all mine everything
is<00:00:24.470> still<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.980> same<00:00:25.240> absolutely<00:00:26.240> everything

is still the same absolutely everything

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.580 
is still the same absolutely everything
except<00:00:27.169> for<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.560> capacitors<00:00:28.900> I'll<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:30.289> have

everything<00:00:52.789> above<00:00:53.030> 30<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.659> don't<00:00:53.960> see<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.469> don't

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
everything above 30 I don't see I don't

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.689 
everything above 30 I don't see I don't
see<00:00:55.069> no<00:00:55.519> dough<00:00:55.730> I<00:00:55.760> don't<00:00:56.179> hear<00:00:56.539> any<00:00:56.809> difference

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
see no dough I don't hear any difference

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.229 
see no dough I don't hear any difference
but<00:00:59.589> at<00:01:00.589> this<00:01:01.039> point<00:01:01.309> which<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.940> sturdy<00:01:02.239> enough

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
but at this point which is sturdy enough

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.600 
but at this point which is sturdy enough
notice<00:01:05.239> some<00:01:05.690> improve<00:01:06.140> them<00:01:06.320> especially<00:01:07.070> in

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
notice some improve them especially in

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.520 
notice some improve them especially in
the<00:01:07.640> sound<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.450> spark<00:01:08.720> gap<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.080> making

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the sound that the spark gap is making

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.789 
the sound that the spark gap is making
and<00:01:09.770> also<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.060> output<00:01:11.780> lights<00:01:12.229> are<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.560> little

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
and also the output lights are a little

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.750 
and also the output lights are a little
bit<00:01:12.979> better<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.860> also<00:01:15.860> there's<00:01:16.190> differences

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
bit better and also there's differences

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.520 
bit better and also there's differences
even<00:01:17.180> though<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:17.540> market<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.350> pretty

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
even though this market now is pretty

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.810 
even though this market now is pretty
small<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:20.900> all<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.500> light<00:01:21.710> up<00:01:21.920> these<00:01:22.100> two<00:01:22.340> in

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
small it is all to light up these two in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.180 
small it is all to light up these two in
the<00:01:23.150> best<00:01:23.360> way<00:01:23.480> possible

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
the best way possible

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.130 
the best way possible
the<00:01:25.190> sound<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.670> making<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.270> much<00:01:26.540> louder<00:01:26.810> than

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
the sound is making is much louder than

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.700 
the sound is making is much louder than
before<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.760> I'm<00:01:29.720> not<00:01:29.930> going<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.230> run<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:30.560> for

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
before so I'm not going to run it for

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.320 
before so I'm not going to run it for
long<00:01:30.950> because<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.310> don't<00:01:31.640> have<00:01:31.760> anything<00:01:32.060> to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
long because I don't have anything to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.610 
long because I don't have anything to
protect<00:01:32.540> my<00:01:32.750> ears<00:01:33.140> yet

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
protect my ears yet

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.570 
protect my ears yet
and<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:35.210> sound<00:01:35.480> is<00:01:35.920> pretty<00:01:36.920> intense<00:01:37.990> when<00:01:38.990> I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
and the sound is pretty intense when I

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.490 
and the sound is pretty intense when I
run<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.730> for<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.910> while<00:01:41.180> just<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.810> few<00:01:41.960> seconds<00:01:42.410> I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
run it for a while just a few seconds I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.220 
run it for a while just a few seconds I
will<00:01:42.770> adjust<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> bigger<00:01:43.820> gap<00:01:44.120> when<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.170> do

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
will adjust it to a bigger gap when I do

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.440 
will adjust it to a bigger gap when I do
that<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.860> will<00:01:46.040> become<00:01:46.250> much<00:01:46.700> louder<00:01:47.000> again

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that it will become much louder again

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.050 
that it will become much louder again
and<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.650> will<00:01:48.770> see<00:01:48.830> much<00:01:49.220> more<00:01:49.250> arcing<00:01:49.790> over

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
and you will see much more arcing over

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.630 
and you will see much more arcing over
here<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:51.320> still<00:01:51.650> needs<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:54.100> fixed<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.310> also

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
here that still needs to fixed and also

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.640 
here that still needs to fixed and also
some<00:01:56.150> organ<00:01:56.570> over<00:01:56.810> here<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.510> my<00:01:59.870> case<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.590> my

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
some organ over here so in my case in my

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.070 
some organ over here so in my case in my
setup<00:02:01.630> 30<00:02:02.630> nm<00:02:02.960> seems<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.400> best

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
setup 30 nm seems to be the best

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.850 
setup 30 nm seems to be the best
capacitors<00:02:07.390> what<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> think<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:08.989> maybe<00:02:09.619> it's

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
capacitors what I think it is maybe it's

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.820 
capacitors what I think it is maybe it's
not<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.489> feel<00:02:10.909> that<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> best<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.290> this

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
not but I feel that is the best in this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.930 
not but I feel that is the best in this
setup<00:02:13.310> because<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.470> sound<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.580> spark<00:02:16.819> gap

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
setup because of the sound the spark gap

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.780 
setup because of the sound the spark gap
is<00:02:17.090> making<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.739> also<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.860> output<00:02:19.040> which<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.580> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
is making and also the output which is a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.630 
is making and also the output which is a
little<00:02:20.060> bit<00:02:20.180> better<00:02:20.330> now<00:02:21.159> going<00:02:22.159> around<00:02:22.280> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
little bit better now going around it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
little bit better now going around it
then<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> gonna<00:02:23.840> yet<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.819> lights<00:02:26.030> off

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
then I gonna yet do the lights off

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.670 
then I gonna yet do the lights off
and<00:02:28.070> those<00:02:28.940> intensities<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.620> said

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and those intensities but like I said

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440 
and those intensities but like I said
I'm<00:02:30.860> not<00:02:30.920> gonna<00:02:31.100> run<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.550> long<00:02:31.700> because<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
I'm not gonna run it long because the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.810 
I'm not gonna run it long because the
sound<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> ozone<00:02:33.620> gas<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:34.100> really<00:02:34.490> not

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
sound and the ozone gas is really not

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:45.820 
sound and the ozone gas is really not
good<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.270> my<00:02:35.420> health<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:37.460> here<00:02:37.610> goes<00:02:44.590> yeah<00:02:45.590> it

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
good for my health so here goes yeah it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.320 
good for my health so here goes yeah it
is<00:02:45.980> very<00:02:46.010> difficult<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.940> see<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.830> dark

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
is very difficult to see in the dark

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.440 
is very difficult to see in the dark
through<00:02:50.330> my<00:02:50.510> camera<00:02:51.610> if<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.850> light<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.240> better

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
through my camera if the light is better

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.540 
through my camera if the light is better
but<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.590> bit<00:02:54.680> better<00:02:54.860> than<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
but it is a little bit better than the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.690 
but it is a little bit better than the
previous<00:02:55.580> video<00:02:56.270> not<00:02:56.600> much<00:02:57.250> for<00:02:58.250> every<00:02:58.550> little

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
previous video not much for every little

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.880 
previous video not much for every little
bit<00:02:58.940> counts

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
bit counts

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.390 
bit counts
gonna<00:03:00.890> try<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> adjust<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:05.800> no<00:03:06.800> no<00:03:06.980> not<00:03:07.220> gonna

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
gonna try to adjust it no no not gonna

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:21.630 
gonna try to adjust it no no not gonna
do<00:03:08.390> wanna<00:03:09.290> go<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.860> rider<00:03:10.130> forget

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.910 

at<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.360> point<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.930> hope<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.560> hear<00:03:23.710> it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
at this point I hope you can hear it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.840 
at this point I hope you can hear it
because<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.370> can

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
because I can

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.200 
because I can
oh<00:03:24.880> boys<00:03:25.690> out<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:25.990> my<00:03:26.200> cellar

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:53.520 

and<00:03:29.300> he<00:03:29.810> threw<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:32.330> wrong

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.600 

this<00:03:53.860> plug

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.800 

okay

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.190 

mmm-hmm<00:04:07.000> like<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.120> said<00:04:08.330> sorry<00:04:08.630> for<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:08.990> short

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
mmm-hmm like I said sorry for the short

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.440 
mmm-hmm like I said sorry for the short
run<00:04:09.560> because<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:10.280> sound<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.760> really<00:04:10.940> killing

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
run because the sound is really killing

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.740 
run because the sound is really killing
my<00:04:11.540> ears<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:13.070> he<00:04:13.160> also<00:04:13.370> gets<00:04:13.790> scaling<00:04:14.660> my

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
my ears and he also gets scaling my

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.770 
my ears and he also gets scaling my
lungs<00:04:15.459> it's<00:04:16.459> not<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.820> intention<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.510> these

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
lungs it's not the intention of these

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.740 
lungs it's not the intention of these
tests<00:04:19.540> but<00:04:20.540> anyway<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.340> basically<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:23.090> happy

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
tests but anyway so basically I happy

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.440 
tests but anyway so basically I happy
with<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.020> now<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:25.490> I'm<00:04:25.610> not<00:04:25.640> gonna<00:04:25.940> go<00:04:26.210> any

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
with this now so I'm not gonna go any

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.320 
with this now so I'm not gonna go any
further<00:04:26.750> with<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.290> capacitance<00:04:28.060> I'm<00:04:29.060> happy

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
further with the capacitance I'm happy

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.360 
further with the capacitance I'm happy
with<00:04:29.420> that<00:04:30.700> they<00:04:31.700> do<00:04:31.760> feel<00:04:32.330> slightly<00:04:33.200> warm<00:04:33.770> not

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
with that they do feel slightly warm not

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.550 
with that they do feel slightly warm not
much

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
much

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.170 
much
the<00:04:36.560> next<00:04:36.890> step<00:04:37.070> will<00:04:37.550> be<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:38.740> make<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:40.040> coil<00:04:40.790> a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
the next step will be to make a coil a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.970 
the next step will be to make a coil a
primary<00:04:41.810> coil<00:04:42.140> of<00:04:43.660> let's<00:04:44.660> say<00:04:44.810> 25<00:04:45.290> turns<00:04:45.590> big

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
primary coil of let's say 25 turns big

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.150 
primary coil of let's say 25 turns big
but<00:04:46.700> I'm<00:04:46.850> gonna<00:04:47.000> let<00:04:47.330> enough<00:04:48.050> space<00:04:48.530> for<00:04:48.890> me<00:04:49.130> to

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
but I'm gonna let enough space for me to

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.130 
but I'm gonna let enough space for me to
test<00:04:49.580> from<00:04:49.850> 23<00:04:50.780> turns<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:51.500> 28<00:04:52.130> turns<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:53.140> see

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
test from 23 turns to 28 turns and see

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.000 
test from 23 turns to 28 turns and see
how<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.440> goes

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
how that goes

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.520 
how that goes
I<00:04:55.120> don't<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.360> wire<00:04:56.570> for<00:04:56.810> it<00:04:56.930> yet<00:04:57.200> but

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
I don't have the wire for it yet but

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.430 
I don't have the wire for it yet but
gonna<00:04:58.310> see<00:04:58.550> what<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.730> can<00:04:59.000> go<00:04:59.120> do<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.600> hopefully

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
gonna see what I can go do and hopefully

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.430 
gonna see what I can go do and hopefully
have<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.800> done<00:05:01.100> in<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.400> week<00:05:01.580> or<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:05.110> like<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.229> said

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
have it done in a week or so like I said

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.740 
have it done in a week or so like I said
autumn<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.310> everything<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.150> same<00:05:08.180> this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
autumn that everything is the same this

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.190 
autumn that everything is the same this
resistor<00:05:09.350> sail<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.220> same<00:05:10.430> value<00:05:10.960> still<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
resistor sail the same value still the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.460 
resistor sail the same value still the
same<00:05:13.210> tip<00:05:14.800> 35<00:05:15.800> 5<00:05:16.180> transistor<00:05:17.350> everything<00:05:18.350> is

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
same tip 35 5 transistor everything is

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.810 
same tip 35 5 transistor everything is
the<00:05:18.530> same<00:05:18.560> all<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.250> difference

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
the same all the difference

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.190 
the same all the difference
I<00:05:19.940> ran<00:05:20.750> from<00:05:20.960> 10nf<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:22.070> 3<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.550> F<00:05:22.930> which<00:05:23.930> seems

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
I ran from 10nf to 3 and F which seems

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.900 
I ran from 10nf to 3 and F which seems
to<00:05:24.440> be<00:05:25.960> seems<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.080> work<00:05:27.290> just<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:28.130> little<00:05:28.430> bit

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
to be seems to work just a little bit

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.400 
to be seems to work just a little bit
better<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.370> did<00:05:31.760> go<00:05:31.910> any<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.570> did<00:05:33.050> go<00:05:33.200> high

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
better so I did go any I did go high

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.790 
better so I did go any I did go high
like<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:33.740> said<00:05:34.120> but<00:05:35.120> they<00:05:35.210> didn't<00:05:35.479> help<00:05:35.600> so<00:05:35.900> I'm

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
like I said but they didn't help so I'm

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.670 
like I said but they didn't help so I'm
gonna<00:05:37.070> stay<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:38.330> it's<00:05:38.930> sturdy<00:05:39.260> enough<00:05:39.380> for

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
gonna stay and it's sturdy enough for

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.310 
gonna stay and it's sturdy enough for
