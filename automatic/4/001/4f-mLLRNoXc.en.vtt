stuck I still can't shoot them and then

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000 
stuck I still can't shoot them and then
the<00:01:00.629> zombies<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:00.960> pile<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> door<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the zombies will pile up on the door so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.399 
the zombies will pile up on the door so
that's<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.370> cool<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.300> um<00:01:03.420> there's<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that's really cool but um there's on a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
that's really cool but um there's on a
way<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.070> push<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> far<00:01:05.760> enough<00:01:05.939> there's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
way if they push you far enough there's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330 
way if they push you far enough there's
a<00:01:06.390> there's<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> chance<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> you'll<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.070> pushed

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a there's a chance that you'll be pushed

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
a there's a chance that you'll be pushed
on<00:01:08.640> through<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.450> barrier<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.439> then

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
on through this barrier as well so then

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
on through this barrier as well so then
you'll<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.710> able<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.040> walk<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.460> inside<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you'll be able to walk around inside of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
you'll be able to walk around inside of
here<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.630> that'd<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.320> cool<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.070> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
here and that'd be really cool so on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
here and that'd be really cool so on
this<00:01:14.430> next<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> another<00:01:16.140> thing<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this next one this is another thing that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
this next one this is another thing that
might<00:01:17.070> happen<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> lay<00:01:17.909> down<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
might happen if you lay down in the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
might happen if you lay down in the
corner<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> zombie<00:01:19.650> pushes<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
corner and then the zombie pushes you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
corner and then the zombie pushes you
you<00:01:20.549> might<00:01:20.759> he<00:01:21.090> might<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.420> jump<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.840> top<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you might he might just jump on top of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
you might he might just jump on top of
you<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.560> push<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> down<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you and then push you down now if you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
you and then push you down now if you
fall<00:01:24.330> under<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.780> map<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> guys<00:01:26.040> are

barriers<00:01:33.960> um<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> death

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
barriers um there's going to be a death

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
barriers um there's going to be a death
barrier<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.689> keep

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
barrier down here so if you just keep

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.679 
barrier down here so if you just keep
falling<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.320> um<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.610> flat<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.299> you'll

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
falling down um like flat then you'll

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.719 
falling down um like flat then you'll
hit<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> death<00:01:40.170> barrier<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> die<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
hit a death barrier and die so on this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
hit a death barrier and die so on this
way<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> keep<00:01:42.360> looking<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> running

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
way if you keep looking up and running

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.270 
way if you keep looking up and running
then<00:01:43.979> you'll<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.729> forever<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.869> um

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
then you'll just be there forever so um

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
then you'll just be there forever so um

out<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.549> shot<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> him<00:01:51.420> he<00:01:52.079> figured

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
out now on one shot to him he figured

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.139 
out now on one shot to him he figured
out<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> look<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:53.970> third

out what if you look at me and third

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
out what if you look at me and third
person<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:54.659> looks<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.409> swimming

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
person actually looks like I'm swimming

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
person actually looks like I'm swimming
so<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> think<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.520> looks<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.119> pretty<00:01:57.270> sick

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
so I think that looks so I'm pretty sick

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
so I think that looks so I'm pretty sick
so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> death<00:01:58.710> bury<00:01:58.950> your

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so you can see you the death bury your

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.679 
so you can see you the death bury your
starting<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> hit<00:01:59.790> me<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.119> slowly<00:02:00.360> hitting

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
starting to hit me it's slowly hitting

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
starting to hit me it's slowly hitting
me<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> am<00:02:01.560> still<00:02:01.829> looking<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> running

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
me but I am still looking up and running

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.520 
me but I am still looking up and running
even<00:02:03.689> though<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> guys<00:02:03.930> can't<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
even though you guys can't see it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.990 
even though you guys can't see it
because<00:02:04.619> your<00:02:04.799> screen<00:02:05.040> goes<00:02:05.250> black<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.790> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because your screen goes black here for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
because your screen goes black here for
a<00:02:06.060> while<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.930> um<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.619> looking<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> I'm

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
a while but um I'm looking up and I'm

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.070 
a while but um I'm looking up and I'm
running

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
running

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.170 
running
and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:09.350> eventually<00:02:09.500> don't<00:02:10.280> worry<00:02:10.430> you'll

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and then eventually don't worry you'll

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.880 
and then eventually don't worry you'll
be<00:02:11.240> outside<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> death<00:02:12.290> barrier<00:02:12.710> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
be outside of the death barrier and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.920 
be outside of the death barrier and
you'll<00:02:13.460> be<00:02:13.580> completely<00:02:13.970> fine<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.660> see<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
you'll be completely fine you see the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.900 
you'll be completely fine you see the
death<00:02:15.080> barrier<00:02:15.410> stops<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.760> then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
death barrier stops right there so then

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910 
death barrier stops right there so then
I'm<00:02:17.060> outside<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.380> start<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.680> heal

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
I'm outside of it and I start to heal

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.860 
I'm outside of it and I start to heal
again<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.490> now<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:19.940> ridiculously

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
again and now I'm like ridiculously

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.300 
again and now I'm like ridiculously
under<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> map<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.590> screen<00:02:21.830> keeps<00:02:22.040> going

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
under the map the screen keeps going

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.250 
under the map the screen keeps going
black<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:22.940> blue<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:24.020> weird

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
black and then blue it's all weird

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.570 
black and then blue it's all weird
you're<00:02:24.350> persons<00:02:24.770> actually<00:02:25.220> thinks<00:02:25.550> he's

you're persons actually thinks he's
swimming<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.360> if<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.020> guys<00:02:27.140> look<00:02:27.380> up<00:02:27.440> there

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
swimming as if you guys look up there

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.280 
swimming as if you guys look up there
you<00:02:27.740> can<00:02:27.890> see<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> teeny<00:02:28.430> tiny<00:02:28.820> map<00:02:29.210> way<00:02:29.840> up

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can see a teeny tiny map way up

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
you can see a teeny tiny map way up
there<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.700> great<00:02:32.300> thing<00:02:32.570> about<00:02:32.720> this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
there so on a great thing about this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.380 
there so on a great thing about this
glitch<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.620> while<00:02:34.280> you're<00:02:34.550> down<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:34.940> if

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
glitch is while you're down here if

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.300 
glitch is while you're down here if
you're<00:02:35.570> if<00:02:35.810> all<00:02:36.290> your<00:02:36.470> teammates<00:02:36.800> die<00:02:37.040> that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
you're if all your teammates die that

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.730 
you're if all your teammates die that
are<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.610> there<00:02:38.170> eventually<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> zombies<00:02:39.710> will

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
are up there eventually the zombies will

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.090 
are up there eventually the zombies will
die<00:02:40.490> um<00:02:40.880> they'll<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:41.780> automatically<00:02:42.710> die

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
die um they'll just automatically die

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.910 
die um they'll just automatically die
off<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.030> that's<00:02:44.270> really<00:02:44.720> great<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.650> then<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
off so that's really great so then the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.260 
off so that's really great so then the
next<00:02:46.040> round<00:02:46.250> will<00:02:46.400> start<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.820> then<00:02:46.940> your

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
next round will start and then your

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.420 
next round will start and then your
teammate<00:02:47.660> will<00:02:47.780> spawn<00:02:48.080> back<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.709> there<00:02:48.950> so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
teammate will spawn back up there so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100 
teammate will spawn back up there so
it's<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.670> always<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> safety<00:02:50.690> net<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.959> guys

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's like always a safety net you guys

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.780 
it's like always a safety net you guys
could<00:02:51.380> literally<00:02:51.890> make<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.459> unlimited

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
could literally make it to unlimited

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.760 
could literally make it to unlimited
rounds<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.480> leave<00:02:53.900> your<00:02:54.020> PlayStation<00:02:54.650> on

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
rounds just leave your PlayStation on

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.190 
rounds just leave your PlayStation on
and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.640> guys<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.270> keep<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:57.080> on

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
and then you guys can just keep going on

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
and then you guys can just keep going on
for<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.560> rounds<00:02:57.920> because<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.280> zombies<00:02:58.640> will

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
for more rounds because the zombies will

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.940 
for more rounds because the zombies will
just<00:02:58.940> keep<00:02:59.060> dying<00:02:59.330> over<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.959> over<00:03:00.050> again<00:03:00.350> it

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
just keep dying over and over again it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.890 
just keep dying over and over again it
will<00:03:01.070> do<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.640> pretty<00:03:02.030> slow<00:03:02.270> but<00:03:02.480> it's<00:03:02.660> just

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
will do it on pretty slow but it's just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.180 
will do it on pretty slow but it's just
really<00:03:03.050> great<00:03:03.230> if<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.620> team<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.860> four

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
really great if you have a team of four

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.740 
really great if you have a team of four
and<00:03:04.220> then<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:04.610> person<00:03:04.940> goes<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.390> glitch

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and then one person goes in this glitch

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.230 
and then one person goes in this glitch

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.540 
so then if all of you die on the game's
not<00:03:08.540> really<00:03:08.930> over<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.400> guys
