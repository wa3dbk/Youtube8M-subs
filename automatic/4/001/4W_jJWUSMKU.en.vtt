now in this video to make a long story
short<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.300> wanted<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> focus<00:00:09.809> solely<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
short I wanted to focus solely on the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.030 
short I wanted to focus solely on the
Alaska<00:00:11.450> 737<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:13.139> project<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.830> my<00:00:13.889> mind

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Alaska 737 this project was on my mind

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
Alaska 737 this project was on my mind
since<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> minute<00:00:14.730> i<00:00:15.030> bought<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> ngx<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
since the minute i bought the ngx and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.519 
since the minute i bought the ngx and
really<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> reason<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.170> have<00:00:19.170> no<00:00:19.320> clue

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
really for a reason that I have no clue

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
really for a reason that I have no clue
I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.460> probably<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I think it's just probably because I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.300 
I think it's just probably because I
haven't<00:00:21.900> integrated<00:00:22.140> into<00:00:22.529> many<00:00:22.710> winter

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
haven't integrated into many winter

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
haven't integrated into many winter
weather<00:00:23.490> settings<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.750> personally<00:00:25.230> enjoy

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
weather settings and I personally enjoy

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.160 
weather settings and I personally enjoy
the<00:00:25.560> snow<00:00:25.619> along<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> environment<00:00:27.000> that

the snow along with the environment that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
the snow along with the environment that

the<00:00:50.280> camera<00:00:50.640> angles<00:00:51.030> every<00:00:51.780> couple<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the camera angles every couple of

the camera angles every couple of
seconds<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> obviously<00:00:53.039> add<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.780> a

seconds to obviously add I don't know a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
seconds to obviously add I don't know a
little<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> edge<00:00:55.440> maybe<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
little bit of edge maybe I don't know if

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
little bit of edge maybe I don't know if
that's<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.059> word<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.570> add<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> little

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that's the right word just add a little

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
that's the right word just add a little
bit<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> change<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.969> i<00:01:00.120> remember<00:01:00.300> right<00:01:00.539> i

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
bit of change but if i remember right i

bit of change but if i remember right i
included<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.170> three<00:01:01.350> landings<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.949> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
included two or three landings in this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
included two or three landings in this
video<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.609> were<00:01:02.789> point-blank<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.629> one

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
video that were point-blank just one

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.070 
video that were point-blank just one
tower<00:01:04.199> view<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.939> shot<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.720> didn't

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
tower view and as I shot that I didn't

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.270 
tower view and as I shot that I didn't
even<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> entire

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
even think I was going to use the entire

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
even think I was going to use the entire
clip<00:01:08.610> justice<00:01:08.880> playing<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.360> clip<00:01:09.659> without

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
clip justice playing that clip without

refreshing but as I was editing that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
refreshing but as I was editing that
kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.659> enjoyed<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> basic<00:01:13.979> follow<00:01:14.220> beaut

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
kind of enjoyed the basic follow beaut

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
kind of enjoyed the basic follow beaut
just<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.060> shot<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:16.409> pretty<00:01:16.590> happy<00:01:16.710> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
just as one shot I was pretty happy with

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.080 
just as one shot I was pretty happy with
the<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.070> turned<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the way it turned out I don't know I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
the way it turned out I don't know I
guess<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.810> point<00:01:18.990> being<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.320> most<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
guess the point being that most of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
guess the point being that most of the
time<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> habitually<00:01:20.580> feel<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> need<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> cut

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
time I habitually feel the need to cut

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
time I habitually feel the need to cut
through<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.170> angle<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
through a different angle and then a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
through a different angle and then a
couple<00:01:23.850> shots<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.659> didn't<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.640> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
couple shots here I didn't do that just

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
couple shots here I didn't do that just
something<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> thought<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.720> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
something that I thought was a little

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
something that I thought was a little
fun<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.470> mine<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.159> I'll<00:01:29.520> shut<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.150> don't
