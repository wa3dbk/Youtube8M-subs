00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 watermelons and melons are very plants 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 productive that generate fruits that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 can reach in the case 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 of the watermelon also the weight of 20 kg and the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.220
 production can exceed 10 kg per 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 square meter are very rich in water 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.680
 and the bearing of sugary substances 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.330
 these plants are creeping and since the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 optimal temperature for their 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.220
 development is around 30 degrees 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.129
 the planting period must be 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.870
 quite advanced in the good season 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.680
 when the minimum temperatures exceed i 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680
 15 degrees 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 to have a good production yes 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.830
 recommends to plant at the beginning of 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.520
 May to bear fruit from the end of July 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.520
 in August 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.560
 to do this use seedlings of 3 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.410
 4 leaves that it is preferable to put on 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.990
 dwell on the upper part of the land with 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.400
 one or two planting densities 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 plants per square meter 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.350
 subsequently abundantly irrigated 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.000
 and do not skimp on fertilizing that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.880
 must take into account the strong 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.260
 removal of potassium and nitrogen and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 strong crop productivity the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.640
 maturation occurs about four months 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
 from germination and it can be 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.650
 noting observing that the and ciro 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.880
 placed on the knot next to the peduncle of the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.880
 fruit dries up 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.829
 when you plant these crops 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.390
 initiated the dispute of not planting them 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.470
 on the same ground of the year 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.569
 previous one 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.569
 since development would be prevented
