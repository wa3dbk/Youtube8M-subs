I'm<00:01:11.369> loving<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.329> colors<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.899> spring

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
I'm loving these colors of spring

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.700 
I'm loving these colors of spring
because<00:01:13.530> they're<00:01:13.679> just<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.070> fresh<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.170> bright

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
because they're just so fresh and bright

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.760 
because they're just so fresh and bright
and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> add<00:01:19.109> more<00:01:19.530> than<00:01:19.590> one

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and you know you can add more than one

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
and you know you can add more than one
color<00:01:20.189> onto<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:21.090> eye<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.359> the<00:01:21.390> same<00:01:21.659> time<00:01:21.929> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
color onto your eye at the same time we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
color onto your eye at the same time we
not<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.380> scared<00:01:22.679> to<00:01:22.950> mix<00:01:23.219> them<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:26.509> think<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
not be scared to mix them I think the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
not be scared to mix them I think the
key<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> getting<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.289> really<00:01:28.649> strong<00:01:28.920> color<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
key to getting a really strong color is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.899 
key to getting a really strong color is
to<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> stiff<00:01:30.390> brush<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> apply<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to use a stiff brush when you apply and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
to use a stiff brush when you apply and
then<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.750> fingers<00:01:33.929> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
then you can just use your fingers to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.910 
then you can just use your fingers to
blend<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.159> edges<00:01:35.609> I<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> be

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
blend in any edges I don't want it to be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.589 
blend in any edges I don't want it to be
too<00:01:37.950> pretty<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.670> we're<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.880> using<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.239> blending

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:39.599 
too pretty so we're not using a blending

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:47.240 
too pretty so we're not using a blending
brush<00:01:39.829> just<00:01:40.829> passing<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.340> into<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> skin<00:01:46.250> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
brush just passing it into the skin the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
brush just passing it into the skin the
