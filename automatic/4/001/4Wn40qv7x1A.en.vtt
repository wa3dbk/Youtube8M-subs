 and added one from this screen 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 launch you note that the phone 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.829
 has three buttons down the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960

 all your applications where it launches yes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.659
 that he clearly distinguishes what is a 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 facebook chat and what is a sms it 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 borrows a little of it to iMessage 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 iphone application launching 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880

 screen of the coup there is not really any 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.640
 traditional home screen there is more 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 that this main screen and of course the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.110

 quickly down and come back to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 the main screen 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.590
 there is a system of notification 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.060

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.100
 slide off the screen for 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 to make them disappear 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.360
 or you can press it for 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.560
 open it and and take a closer look 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 of course it works with the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.710
 notifications that come from other 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 ap 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.920
 if you still want to deepen yourself 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.870

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.180
 from the apps screen or the screen 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 main 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.430
 facebook has integrated a pretty system 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880
 nice to chat 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.040
 he calls cat help so this is a 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.660
 simple icon a photo of a friend who 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.690
 form a little bubble that you can 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.220
 slide anywhere on the screen you 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.330

 slide the bile down to close 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.820
 a cost using the same gesture 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.480
 the bubble responds really well to the touch 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.620
 a bit like a football that is 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.490
 rather fun this phone htc first is a 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.370
