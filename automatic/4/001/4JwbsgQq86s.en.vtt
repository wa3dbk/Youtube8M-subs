the<00:00:10.440> ball<00:00:11.420> but<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.019> lock<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.380> down

you can't let goals go in and that's my

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.849 
you can't let goals go in and that's my
mindset<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.049> should<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.230> every<00:00:16.500> defenders

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
mindset it should be every defenders

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.320 
mindset it should be every defenders
mindset<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> our<00:00:17.580> mindset<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.090> won<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
mindset it is our mindset we won this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.810 
mindset it is our mindset we won this
game<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.720> many<00:00:19.080> different<00:00:19.289> ways<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.460> we

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
game in many different ways and we

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.010 
game in many different ways and we
didn't<00:00:21.029> finish<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.330> many<00:00:21.510> chances<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
didn't finish as many chances as we

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.980 
didn't finish as many chances as we
created<00:00:23.090> speaking<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.420> myself<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.960> course

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
created speaking for myself of course

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.500 
created speaking for myself of course
but<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> thought<00:00:26.789> Megan<00:00:26.970> Rapinoe<00:00:27.180> had

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
but you know I thought Megan Rapinoe had

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.700 
but you know I thought Megan Rapinoe had
one<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> best<00:00:27.990> games<00:00:28.050> i've<00:00:28.349> seen<00:00:28.380> her<00:00:28.590> play

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
one of the best games i've seen her play

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460 
one of the best games i've seen her play
maybe<00:00:29.460> ever<00:00:29.670> she<00:00:30.510> contributed<00:00:31.050> she<00:00:31.260> was<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
maybe ever she contributed she was the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.600 
maybe ever she contributed she was the
person<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.980> wanted<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> bow<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.399> go

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
person that we wanted the bow to go

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
person that we wanted the bow to go
through<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> midfield<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:34.079> every

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
through the midfield I think every

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.660 
through the midfield I think every
single<00:00:34.710> time<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.280> she<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.520> sending

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
single time you know she was sending

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
single time you know she was sending
balls<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.120> left<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.480> both<00:00:37.200> sides<00:00:37.469> she

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
balls in left and right both sides she

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
balls in left and right both sides she
played<00:00:38.520> hard<00:00:38.790> defensively<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.800> she

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
played hard defensively and you know she

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.139 
played hard defensively and you know she
I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.129> she<00:00:41.340> had<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> part<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.790> both<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I think she had a part in both of the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
I think she had a part in both of the
goal<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.640> getting

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
goal so you know I think that getting

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
goal so you know I think that getting
those<00:00:45.390> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> players<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> confidence

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
those kind of players kind of confidence

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
those kind of players kind of confidence
leading<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> London<00:00:47.520> leading<00:00:48.180> into<00:00:48.360> their

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
leading in the London leading into their

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.970 
leading in the London leading into their
first<00:00:48.660> Olympics<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> huge<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.800> feeling

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
first Olympics is huge I'm feeling

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
first Olympics is huge I'm feeling
really<00:00:50.309> fit<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> helps<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> more<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
really fit I think that helps the more I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.080 
really fit I think that helps the more I
can<00:00:51.899> move<00:00:52.020> around<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:53.430> tire<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can move around and not tire out the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
can move around and not tire out the
better<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.140> we're<00:00:55.379> playing<00:00:55.469> well<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:55.890> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a defender and a-rod three thought I'd

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100
