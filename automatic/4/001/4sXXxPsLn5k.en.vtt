00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 in this video i will tell you about how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.220
 remove air conditioner 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.340
 Well, rather how to overtake your freon 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.630
 an outdoor unit that could be disconnected 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.070
 split system remove the indoor unit or 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 completely remove the air conditioner for this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 we will need how to disable the set 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.989
 hexagons 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.989
 and pipe cutter so here's this type 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.040
 more cutters and probably 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:49.700
 big secret Phillips screwdriver 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.700
 there is no there is done very simply 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.210
 unscrew the caps with an adjustable wrench 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.210
 micron 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.150
 here is the hospital point 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.870
 if I'm under the mod because the tap and 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.870
 miss 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.870
 meaning we are shooting right now 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:57.610
 air conditioner that works 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:02:01.090
 cools and ordinary household you pumped 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.720
 cooling collector set 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 minimum temperature 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.180
 for the fact that the air conditioner got freon 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:42.900
 can you processed compresses solutions though 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:46.849
 would take a minute now we take 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.849
 hexagon which 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.210
 where is going 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.140
 and first close the tap which 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.140
 suited thin tube 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 the end 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.030
 until the end of the tatra we mark one minute on 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.030
 for hours 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.389
 I did not go to the second class 2 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.240
 we see a thin tube on the cathedral in this 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.240
 just show us something 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:59.169
 and now you can turn off take the remote and 

00:04:54.549 --> 00:05:00.369
 turn off everything on the clock it is all collected 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.959
 in the outdoor unit 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:06.599
 that is, we can take a pipe cutter to trim 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:12.189
 through the pipe 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:16.809
 cut the wire well open the fasteners and 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:19.839
 remove the block for which countries further 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:24.659
 our goals and indoor unit also 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:24.659
 you can have it cut cut 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.199
 whether to carry somewhere there 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.059
 something else 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.239
 it is necessary to cut off such a 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:38.529
 paresis or similar to chips 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:39.639
 didn't get inside and ends we 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.129
 cut off which will stay on 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.239
 air conditioners with gadget they need 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.279
 be sure to bend 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:48.249
 or twist tape but in general what 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.979
 there was no dirt and dirt 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.159
 more water is not on the indoor unit exactly 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:59.990
 so here too the wires can all 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:03.060
 cut with nippers and all 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.860
 Well, to make sure to the end, that is what 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:11.150
 three we all gathered in the external unit 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:21.410
 on the edge some with a thick tube 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:24.750
 There are 10 of us Gadget from this Gadget 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.100
 there is a spool- type automobile 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:33.270
 if we press it, he should have a little 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:39.650
 air yourself so suck if there will be 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.650
 freon leftover freon then from there we will see
