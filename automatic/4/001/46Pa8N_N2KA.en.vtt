00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.449
 my luck had I had not fallen 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.170
 over as it has happened several times 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.490
 problematic after he has seen some 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 new mystery as I tell you my aesthetic 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.160
 super the new the look of the white that already 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.390
 I changed it a few days that by the way 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 it's a video in which I changed it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 that looks the best I leave it with the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 description in case you want to see it and very 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.910
 guys, as I say today, I bring you a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.769
 new oyster mystery is like you 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 leads to more finish trex because it is not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.590
 a mystery that is itself in the game 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 but it is something that must be discovered like this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 what can we better call it interest and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 good to see that something pretty 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 quite interesting and also comes 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.230
 quite a story since as you already know 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.550
 just a few days ago a government 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.610
 just yesterday or before yesterday not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 I remember well then that came out a new 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.280
 occurrence of new wine which we have 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.420
 to do a kind of mission in the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 campaign mode and then go to mode 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 online etcetera etcetera how to play a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 little the game and then we go to a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480
 exact location that good also os 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 I'll leave that video in the description worth 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 which by the way was quite acceptable 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 more than almost 2,000 likes what has 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 I am happy a lot I give the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.480
 thanks obviously and then well as 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.700
 I say it was a 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.020
 and here comes the ambulance for the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.950
 firefighters to put out the fire so I 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.510
 love to make a video lie that the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.790
 Firefighters pay a lot when they 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.590
 discovered a new UFO which was 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.330
 in online mode and you could go through 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.950
 it was like no texture and you could see 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.210
 how was the UFO inside and so on 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.530
 etcetera not then well then 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.520
 right here in this location it's worth 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 in which I'm going to leave it in 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.810
 screen right here is worth in this 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.580
 sad about my city that is here in the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.470
 this one of the saints here next to the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.510
 poplars and well right here we have 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 to come here in that kind of mini 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.620
 triangulito then we come here is worth and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.570
 so here, at first glance, no 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.980
 we see nothing is worth it if we do not see anything but if 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.780
 We can not do it here, there is something but it looks 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.270
 nothing until then it is until then thank you 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.450
 for putting out the fire come please 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.070
 we are very good afterwards see if we 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 we just set there I do not know if with the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 Capture quality can be 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.080
 appreciate very well but if you have a 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.970
 tele hd and you come here to this location 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.390
 of the map so you are going to see what 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.320
 perfectly look from there 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.510
 look at that light that light is a damn UFO 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.940
 starry or from here you see 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.770
 perfectly you see the perfect silhouette 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.910
 from a damn UFO, maybe you 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.380
 the captured captor would not be 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.050
 noticing them very well but look if you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.970
 you fix when we approach the look 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.050
 disappears and when we leave it comes back 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.820
 appear disappear appear disappear 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.100
 appears then we can achieve is something 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.330
 you do not know very well these lines 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.010
 we aim with a gun because I think that 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.989
 a does not look like I think if that wall 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.430
 and assets of adjustment before pointing with a 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.270
 gun gone now now now 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.430
 you have seen mining is worth seeing 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.290
 now it does not appear and we aim with this and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 disappears as you see is like a kind 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.250
 of hologram we could say and how much 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.780
 more night is the more darkness then 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.690
 It looks much better and as I say 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.280
 honestly I think it's a bus is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.990
 a damn I would say it is another one and more 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.020
 discovered because you have the damn 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.600
 same silhouette as a god does not like 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.580
 be a piece of giant bread is not not 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.710
 another thing 6 is a god I would say is 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.790
 a UFO and as I say is a kind of 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.530
 program since when when what 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.180
 we know the look then disappears as 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.290
 You see, and when we take it away, it goes back to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 appear in the wta is something pretty 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.120
 quite strange and good as this has 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.490
 left very very but very scratched and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.040
 this has been a signal which I know 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.900
 I 'm going to leave a dlc of aliens in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.130
 that is 5 yes or yes or is but yes or yes 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.570
 because there are millions and millions of 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.190
 signs and this they do not have to put 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.230
 for putting this they have to us them floor 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 that you should know how someone is watching 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.350
 of while we're going to be 5 something like that 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.450
 because I do not know is that there are too many 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.980
 too many traces and assumptions 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.810
 towards the aliens we are not going to take a 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.110
 kind of car to go 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.270
 where is the why did not you come 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.440
 with a car with a car it appeared then 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.450
 you will not see that not as soon as we 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.730
 we approach disappears you see it there 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.380
 you do not see it and we approach and it disappears 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.030
 the wta that's pretty weird 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.280
 let's just go to the location 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.080
 which I would love to see you 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.580
 but as you can see I hallucinate 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.470
 very much with this game is that it puts 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.940
 mysteries up to the most mysteries 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.140
 rare of the world like this one or is 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.550
 just up there is worth but you're going to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.170
 see that nothing can not be we can not 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.730
 live with the car let's see here 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.700
 walking but you will see that no less is 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.549
 that no no no no seems nothing is impossible 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.140
 we do not know that that is exactly not 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.030
 we know that I would say it was a UFO 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.720
 confirmed if my character does not fall by 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.829
 the truth that would be pretty cool 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.370
 it's just here it's worth just 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.900
 here we would find what we just 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.300
 see right there from afar but 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.770
 As you can see there is nothing worth then 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.270
 Well, as I say something quite 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.860
 interesting but capel and with a piece 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.110
 of like and nothing, so let's hope that 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.760
 take out someone's dlc because this 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.500
 mystery no no I can not sleep by the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.570
 night with this ministry that there is of 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.710
 some traffic basically that has been 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.880
 everything as I say I hope above all this 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.530
 video you can leave blake who please 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.060
 all and hidden are doing six and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.220
 eighteen monthly that my character has 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.290
 mountain climbing Seville will give 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.290
 It looks like a twisted iguana
