00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.780
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.600
 foto pia today is the question 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.789
 It is true that great music is poisonous 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.220
 and dangerous and not good for 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.120
 you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 No, certainly not coal suisse 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.320
 healthy they do you good 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.180
 but how do you get on this statement 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.039
 this idea that this might not be so 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 and that they could even be poisonous 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:40.290
 Now in some leafy vegetables nests 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.829
 For example, oxalic acid contained in the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 scroll of red beet beets in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.350
 Mangold and in spinach and oxalic acid is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.960
 associated with kidney stones 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 and so has some or so many 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.059
 Common in green smoothies oxalic acid 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.780
 that is, if I smoothie an apartment 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.040
 I drink and get kidney stones 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 Verein does not do it again 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.820
 First of all, even with oxalic acid 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
 his own body produces 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.100
 Vitamin C can make the body oxalic 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.399
 and second , oxalic acid is not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.999
 only contained in blood vegetables but 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.990
 I also only wrote down eggs 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:24.529
 fish meat coffee and tea in soy in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.029
 Peanuts in strawberries and almonds 

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:30.149
 almonds way, are not nuts have 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:34.709
 l learned recently but the seeds 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:39.599
 the almond tree fruit of the change 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:42.630
 bad, too, so it's included 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.520
 in immature harvested tomatoes even if 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.659
 the tomatoes on brunis and shrimp 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 Plucked it has oxalic acid if you can 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.319
 wait until she is beautiful red and ripe 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.840
 and then happiness is the first 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:00.409
 oxalic acid is gone also good to know 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.409
 He also in paprika and eggplant 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.779
 good if you already have it now 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 should have kidney stones or 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:08.880
 may be prone to kidney stones 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 Nevertheless , I do not dedicate myself to a customer 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.780
 Drink smoothie now if I'm just 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.110
 heard that spinach contains auxerre 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.390
 well you can of a green 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 smoothie with spinach 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.630
 I do not think it's possible 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.490
 to get a job and if you can 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 every day is half a kilo 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.340
 spinach leaves will be in his ranks and 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.680
 the right three for four months so 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.080
 operates then a likely 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.730
 At first, somehow , they do not taste good anymore 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.120
 because she is the same to me and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.070
 secondly yes then it may be that one 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.989
 kidney stones developed anyway 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.209
 This can be counteracted very easily 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.790
 namely by simply his 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.500
 leafy vegetables take turns every day 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.190
 Another variety is enough 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.780
 if you're within a week of your only 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.010
 used once, that means you 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 if you need it every day now 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.170
 You need a cool smoothie drink 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.519
 only seven different varieties and the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.040
 thing is done and you need it 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.000
 do not worry about anything else 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.930
 now there is certainly someone who says 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.670
 I know but no 7 space vegetables can 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.650
 I now know only if I just spinach 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.190
 Now I can only spin it in once 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 drink the week and that's it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 Spinach then already mentioned 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.019
 quite dangerous the leaves of red 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.200
 beet I 'm quite used already so 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.140
 one day spinat that other stuff 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.160
 can 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.900
 These are also red and red lettuce leaves 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.670
 I knew that inside now 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.280
 pick and another day 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.560
 use the leaves of red beets on 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.959
 second day on the third day but wants 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.540
 not used on the fourth day coriander 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:06.070
 a bit like with peter 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:10.790
 but soul is coriander on the fifth day 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.170
 celery and then in the 607 day could 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.090
 you can still use it, for example 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.289
 basil or parsley or curly 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.800
 Kohl or I wrote with it 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:27.590
 other lettuce with lemon balm 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.260
 wheatgrass windows 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.400
 and if somehow in the middle of the forest 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.410
 stands and his cool smoothie ingredients 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.440
 you could also use the search 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.760
 leaves from a fourth tree or from 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.919
 an oak clover or even the green of 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.540
 so carrots are not red anymore 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.410
 We also have carrots and live green 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.510
 that can be used 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.430
 that of carrots so that baroque 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.430
 that's me, that's not me 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.090
 so noticed but with carrots you 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.450
 that's nice 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.310
 that tastes the green easily 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.990
 carrots 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.190
 then you can look what fits 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.900
 on other ingredients 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.669
 But there is a second reason 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.340
 why alternate a leafy vegetable there 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.010
 should and if we always only 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.110
 So quietly leafy vegetables is only red 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.090
 turnip leaves then you get 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.950
 all these micronutrients are not those 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.289
 in the many other leafy vegetables 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.310
 separate 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.539
 Also, then sometime tastes 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.780
 boring if you only have that 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.979
 same platform uses some green 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.660
 actually does not taste very much 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.220
 many others stronger again but imagine 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.120
 you the same before every day that is yes 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.419
 boring maybe that's why 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.520
 with this loss for a change 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.410
 equipped with it all of us 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.479
 getting nutrients it would be a whole 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.430
 good plausible explanation 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.470
 I hope I could help you 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.310
 and you're just a tenant cabbage now 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.039
 and smoothies instead of scary when 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.800
 you liked the video and hear more 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:04.389
 want to subscribe to a channel if you 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.880
 recipes need to look over orange 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.120
 www.adobe.com have a nice day and still 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.120
 bye for now
