00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.270 
the things that I asked my scientific
advisors<00:01:56.630> was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
advisors was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.670 
advisors was
what<00:01:57.820> are<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.000> cross-training<00:01:58.720> modalities

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
what are the cross-training modalities

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.820 
what are the cross-training modalities
best<00:02:01.310> for<00:02:01.910> distance<00:02:02.270> training<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:03.350> they<00:02:03.530> told

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
best for distance training and they told

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.610 
best for distance training and they told
me<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.940> one<00:02:05.150> single<00:02:05.810> best<00:02:06.140> cross

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
me that the one single best cross

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.249 
me that the one single best cross
training<00:02:07.070> modality<00:02:08.030> out<00:02:08.540> there<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:09.110> my

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
training modality out there for my

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.410 
training modality out there for my
distance<00:02:09.860> runners<00:02:10.220> was<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.910> hide<00:02:11.090> your<00:02:11.270> works

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
distance runners was to hide your works

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.540 
distance runners was to hide your works
underwater<00:02:11.750> treadmill<00:02:12.370> tests<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.430> have

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
underwater treadmill tests that have

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.370 
underwater treadmill tests that have
been<00:02:13.580> done<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:14.150> muscular<00:02:14.540> functioning<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
been done on muscular functioning on the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.890 
been done on muscular functioning on the
hydraulics<00:02:15.890> underwater<00:02:16.280> treadmill<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.570> that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
hydraulics underwater treadmill so that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.340 
hydraulics underwater treadmill so that
it<00:02:17.990> minutes<00:02:18.590> very<00:02:19.490> closely<00:02:20.350> muscular

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
it minutes very closely muscular

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.830 
it minutes very closely muscular
function<00:02:21.830> involved<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.940> running<00:02:23.240> outside<00:02:23.390> on

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
function involved in running outside on

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
function involved in running outside on
dry<00:02:24.020> land<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.070> for<00:02:25.250> me<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.430> made<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
dry land so for me that made it a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.240 
dry land so for me that made it a
no-brainer<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.930> we're<00:02:27.530> gonna<00:02:27.650> cross<00:02:27.890> train

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
no-brainer that we're gonna cross train

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.820 
no-brainer that we're gonna cross train
this<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.820> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.150> be<00:02:29.270> our<00:02:29.420> primary

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
this is going to be our primary

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:45.320 
this is going to be our primary
cross-training<00:02:30.940> vehicle<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.090> were<00:02:32.210> using

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:03:00.290

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.830 

we<00:03:01.300> don't<00:03:01.510> consider<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.020> as<00:03:03.000> an<00:03:04.000> alternative

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
we don't consider it as an alternative

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.570 
we don't consider it as an alternative
to<00:03:04.900> running<00:03:05.260> outside<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.860> consider<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.460> as

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
to running outside we consider it as

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.820 
to running outside we consider it as
important<00:03:07.300> as<00:03:07.420> running<00:03:07.600> outside<00:03:08.110> because

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
important as running outside because

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.280 
important as running outside because
it's<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.640> help<00:03:09.910> us<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.630> become<00:03:10.780> stronger

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
it's going to help us to become stronger

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's going to help us to become stronger
by<00:03:11.560> running<00:03:11.770> against<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> resistance<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.790> the

by running against the resistance of the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.030 
by running against the resistance of the
water<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:14.230> going<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.470> help<00:03:14.590> us<00:03:14.740> recover

water and it's going to help us recover
