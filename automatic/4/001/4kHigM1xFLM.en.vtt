 files that came in the description and 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.630

 and to do it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 but we leave each hour yes 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.300
 then this window will come out 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.300
 Y 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.340
 we look for the plan of the p and here 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.489

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.060
 a desk 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.850

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.910
 decompress do not decompress 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.400

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.420
 ready we open it and now our cell 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.380
 and we turn it off 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.820
 we turn off we hope we hope that the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.290
 cellular is completely off 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.050
 totally good for 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.780
 leave it to pick up and open it in mode 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.980
 administrator 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 d 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 ready when they are trained 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.480
 has really saved what we are going to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.860
 do and give him the home button 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.740
 the button down 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.740
 the volume down and the power button 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 but when we go to see that screen 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 we give volume up 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.350
 the story box about this we connect 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.870
 our securing the computer to them 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.270
 I remember that by doing this process of 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.270
 help you will lose the guarantee of your 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.539
 mobile 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.440
 good and have our cell phone connected 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.890
 to the computer then you will see that it will come out 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.410
 here it looks or se or mms taxes depends 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.480
 of dependency can leave 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.980
 any other any good then 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 we give in to be 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.000
 then it will restart 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.330
 thereafter 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.050
 on our cell phone 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.770
 let's see 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.980
 ready when he's already subscribed then what 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.760
 that we have here from a button with the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.390
 volume key up and the button 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.390
 over 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.040
 when you read 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.459
 to leave 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.459
 pick up the story you can see 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.620
 then we give it where it says install 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.620
 and we look 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.780
 we look where we say we seek to be 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.730
 actions or per user that the same in 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 the description here is 1.93 593 you 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.830
 we give 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.710
 read this to the other do 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.470
 we give it to that way and that's it 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.880
 starting to load our ready already 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.930
 integrated but exist and will restart 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.810
 our cell phone 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.760
 remember that the guarantee will be taken away 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.939
 when doing this procedure 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.329
 Well there can see that everything goes 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.329
 normal 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.040
 and all the normal 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.750
 so now let's check that 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.900
 our cell phone if it is blocked 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.500
 let's go to the application that I have of 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.970
 Manchester 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.970
 like a check 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.569
 with the 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.440
 the superuser icon you can see 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.440
 but it still will not come out 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.520
 licona superuser 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.219
 well then we take a rocker 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.219
 good here tonight 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.180
 Czech 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.180
 the appetizer 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 the effect of weakening 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.440
 as you can see there 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.210
 the video hits like that because that will help me 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.410
 to keep making more videos subscribe 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.360

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.230
 new tutorials that I'm going to do a lot
