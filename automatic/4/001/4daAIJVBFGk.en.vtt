 another episode 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.810

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.430
 chronicles on playstation 3 i'm going 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.560
 tell you about a bug that will help you 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.200
 do not make a dungeon 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.330
 the occurrence the most expensive dungeon the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.250
 game the forest says mir then I you 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.540

 the old one as you can see 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.920
 so normally we are not even supposed 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.510
 to be aware of the existence of the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.910
 throat of t on but still it's going 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.200
 walk you will understand why 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.820
 it's a bug that's been done by 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.880
 normal costume I do not know if we are 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.900
 obliged to do it but I prefer then 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.610
 you will notice that every time 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.750
 you talk to the half elf actually there is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.060
 a black screen and you end up 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.440
 teleport a few steps before then into 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.240
 do what you're going to do here you 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.100
 wait a little half turn 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.660
 here you go to the left against the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 wall and you wait for an enemy 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.600
 appear as soon as the enemy goes 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.700
 appear you're going to make sure 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.220
 darken on the right wall and as soon as 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.310
 the enemy will have begun to pierce the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.539
 half elf you will start moving forward 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.580
 for the dmi she will make you 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.330
 teleport look up 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.250
 now you start again you are 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.479
 teleported continue to advance teleported 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.800
 once again quickly started the fight 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.020
 attention 3-2-1 bim 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.070
 this is good then we run that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.300
 fight I showed you besides a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 attack in unison of the version 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 playstation 3 during this power the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.400
 winning technique here are zelos and limit 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.930
 fell in love with this gastropod 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.190
 since he saved her outright from 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.600
 beams that wavy eruptions 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.530
 attention attack coming who's really 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.040
 beautiful on the version 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.140
 playstation 3 that's 4342 damage here 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.150
 you started to flee and so you go 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.800
 have to go to the top right especially 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.940
 do not press surprise because if you 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.440
 press three the text will pass 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.690
 you will be teleported to the entrance so 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.090
 it's gone at the top right diagonal 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.220
 here we go to the end do not open 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.150
 the trunk pressed increases to pass the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.709
 text is normally you're going 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.040
 teleport right behind that's it 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.010
 good here's that's it so you're at the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.409
 throat of the one without having done 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.879
 the dungeon the dungeon of the evening of yesterday 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.930
 which is one of the most boring so here we go 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.459
 I'm actually showing you what's going on 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.230
 when you have the damn flask actually 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.150
 and the monsters are no longer 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.860
 regulated at a speed or 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.480
 precise trajectory and in fact they 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.890
 can get excited and just come 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.079
 in front of you while you're not even 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.310
 not supposed to know the dungeon the 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.450
 function of the sorcerer's note has changed 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.980
 you can open the chests 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.890
 we already see some changes so 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.730
 the flowers are orangey yellow are not 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.690
 more orange and red 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
 the shield is blue and no longer green 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.670
 so here are some little things like that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.310
 so why am I doing this 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.629
 simply to show that we 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.560
 can skip and dungeon of which there is still 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.450
 bugs but also because here I am 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.840
 did not want to do it I already had 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.239
 seen the video so that's it so yes so 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.639
 you will beat the plant x and well and 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.349
 as you return to the forest of ymir 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.329
 you can go directly to hem dole 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.480
 without going through the dungeon because there 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.549
 will have the option to take a shortcut then 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.639
 is what you will get the stick 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.599
 the old I do not know but especially I 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.099
 do this video I do not do that for 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.299
 we skip the dungeon is done on all that 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.739
 for those who want to arrive at the end 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.819
 to grab all the costumes by 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.290
 example what everyone knows that 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.910
 on tales of symphonia you have to make 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.709
 least three to four parts to have 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.910
 everyone's costumes so that's 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.980
 especially for that I do that so 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.269
 that's why especially I do not 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.010
 does not show you what's going on in the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.599
 scenario after that like that you 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.810
 encourage to do the dungeon by you 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.810
 even to do the quest and after well 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.480
 sure in a new part what pays 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.040
 the dungeon of the forest says mir so that's it 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.180
 it's cool yes obviously the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.820
 behavior will not be complete you 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.430
 will not get the tithing fruit so 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.810
 for the title compendium 100% it's grated 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.470
 also even if you have to do several 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.780
 left with 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.790
 so here I present you too and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.380
 some costumes of such offers 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.560
 sinfonia chronicle no bonus so we 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.440
 see rain which is in pascal of tales of 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.260
 specified heifers that is in him ivan 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.370
 fabre of call the abyss china because I do not 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.270
 do not know what to look at a little bit 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.590
 the bottom slide as she is beautiful 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.460
 still the boom of level iii are 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.640
 really more beauty 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.530
 we see that the smoothing hd has been done good 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.180
 we do not really see it because finally we 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.680
 just see it a little bit because I 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.630
 I remember I do not save / hdmi 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.100
 unfortunately but here we see that he 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.420
 there was a little hd message that was made 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.780
 is that spells are really of any 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.080
 beauty 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.580
 it's good tales of sinfonia what 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.190
 so we will try to leave just 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.050
 to show you once again how 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
 been made of play that is to say that the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.570
 half talk she will be different 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.120
 in fact according to which side from where from where 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.440
 you talk to him you will see you him 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.550
 talk from behind he will tell you 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.080
 have the stick of the old you go 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.700
 understand look up at you have the 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.020
 old smart stick you want to go 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.790
 so wanted to talk about behind that's it 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.050
 but if against you him you have the 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.180
 woe to him back in front and well 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.800
 the bug will be canceled and in the end the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.210
 barrier will be crossed and we will 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.190
 to say bah out you do not have 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.910
 the authorization to pass does not prevent 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.230
 is we are 8 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.110
 we can fart him easily 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.970
 but no, this is the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.290
 the synopsis was not affected if you 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.870
 go see the old is what it will be 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.670
 affected I leave you I leave you the 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.870
 do that I have a little bit of suspense 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.950
 anyway so you're well here 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.870
 look at you go stick of old you 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.910
 can go on again you go 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.410
 old buildings that's attention up 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.360
 you need permission to enter and 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.650
 it's over then I'm going to show you 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.020
 anyway I'm not going through 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.370
 the forest ten thousand stories of that I 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.970
 not manipulate the images so that's 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.950
 party heading the forest tithe which 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.210
 is not long at will not have an when 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.320
 we were on mac we could go into 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.460
 a city now we can do more 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.380
 we have to go down nine 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.400
 otherwise we come up against an invisible wall 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.600
 it's a shame it's really very 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.670
 pity yet this compile to hd 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.100
 really played very well drill began there 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.570
 so be welcome 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.280
 undoubtedly haendel is there 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.360
 before we must we we are born 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.740
 so here we did not do the dungeon 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.230
 you see well the flowers are not 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.680
 asked I have a cinematic that is 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.320
 sets off 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.880
 so that proves that I did not 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.110
 damn about you and if you come back here 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.910
 after beating plants x one you 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.710
 will propose to take the 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.000
 shortcut directly so I'm going to you 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.410
 just show up again in two three 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.110
 little tips for version version 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.370
 hd in fact here is so look a little a 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.510
 little to direction and the median and 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.920
 look especially even if you 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.020
 stop the sound of planted potting soil 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.720
 behind it's a pity it's a small 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.000
 detail but hey that's a lot of 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.350
 people had pointed out on the on the 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.670
 forums a lot of people had told me 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.070
 and especially watch the last one 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.300
 thing at the level of the unit tree on 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.060
 actually sees that the art of leaving us 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.230
 the outline has been redone in hd and we see 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.090
 in fact that the new texture has been 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.560
 ensured to superimpose the first and that 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.790
 does a big square all ugly in fact one 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.590
 see the limits of the new texture 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.350
 the boundaries of the old so that makes 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.100
 a black square pretty ugly but that's it 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.960
 it's a small detail 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.040
 again and that's they did that 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.390
 for all places but that's it 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.950
 does not prevent this game is really very 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.570
 well and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.000
 for the rest of play at tales of 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.320
 symphonia chronicles for a video I 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.550
 do not know what but I know there 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.230
 will be there will always be videos there 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.620
 on it go hi everyone 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.620
 and see you soon
