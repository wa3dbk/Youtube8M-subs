00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
Square just totally paved out there and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.610 
Square just totally paved out there and
the<00:01:20.450> fact<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.720> there's<00:01:20.960> different<00:01:21.380> lanes

racing around there's different ways

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.600 
racing around there's different ways
that<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.479> race<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.870> race<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:25.159> can<00:01:25.190> start

them there and when the race gets going
we<00:01:31.520> are<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.030> race<00:01:32.270> around<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.320> through

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
we are going to race around here through

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.180 
we are going to race around here through
here<00:01:34.190> up<00:01:34.640> here<00:01:35.000> around<00:01:35.360> here<00:01:35.900> over<00:01:36.290> here<00:01:36.680> like

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
here up here around here over here like

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.760 
here up here around here over here like
this<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.110> around<00:01:39.110> back<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.530> finish<00:01:39.740> line

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
this and around back to the finish line

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
this and around back to the finish line
it's<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.070> three-lap<00:01:40.430> race<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:40.940> kind<00:01:41.180> of

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's a three-lap race it's kind of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.300 
it's a three-lap race it's kind of
difficult<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.810> one<00:01:42.049> lap<00:01:42.290> races<00:01:42.799> with<00:01:43.100> this

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
difficult to do one lap races with this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.399 
difficult to do one lap races with this
board<00:01:43.580> although<00:01:44.330> it's<00:01:44.510> quite<00:01:44.630> feasible<00:01:45.020> if

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
board although it's quite feasible if

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.950 
board although it's quite feasible if
you<00:01:45.500> want<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.060> also<00:01:47.240> start<00:01:47.690> everybody

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
you want to you can also start everybody

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.680 
you want to you can also start everybody
so<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:48.979> they<00:01:49.190> are<00:01:49.369> lined<00:01:50.180> up<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.570> these

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so that they are lined up on these

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.219 
so that they are lined up on these
alternate<00:01:51.290> routes<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.540> we<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:54.049> them

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
alternate routes so that we have them

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.609 
alternate routes so that we have them
all<00:01:54.409> here<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:57.430> once<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.610> say<00:01:58.850> go<00:01:59.150> they<00:02:00.110> all<00:02:00.290> go

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
all here and once we say go they all go

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.440 
all here and once we say go they all go
and<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.070> could<00:02:01.250> basically<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.150> go<00:02:02.299> on

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
and you could basically have to go on

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.469 
and you could basically have to go on
all<00:02:02.720> three<00:02:03.320> routes<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:04.970> up<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.270> you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
all three routes and it's up to you

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.750 
all three routes and it's up to you
which<00:02:06.170> route<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.500> take<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:06.950> which<00:02:07.100> order<00:02:07.460> now

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
which route you take in which order now

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.249 
which route you take in which order now
if<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:07.909> notice<00:02:08.239> there's<00:02:08.420> only<00:02:08.569> one<00:02:08.810> pit<00:02:09.050> stop

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
if you notice there's only one pit stop

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.050 
if you notice there's only one pit stop
area<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:09.770> on<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.009> route<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.880> might<00:02:11.000> not

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
area it's on that route so it might not

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.840 
area it's on that route so it might not
be<00:02:11.330> able<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.599> take

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
be able to take

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.810 
be able to take
for<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.840> straight<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:13.800> or<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.700> go

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
for you to go straight here or to go

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.220 
for you to go straight here or to go
down<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.090> Center<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> center

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
down to Center one because the center

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.020 
down to Center one because the center
one<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.710> come<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.280> unless<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
one is going to come out there unless of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.190 
one is going to come out there unless of
course<00:02:18.060> you're<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> push<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> Center

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
course you're going to push that Center

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.230 
course you're going to push that Center
one<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> love<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.100> because<00:02:20.340> there's<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
one and I love this because there's a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.850 
one and I love this because there's a
couple<00:02:21.420> reasons<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.350> because

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
couple reasons I like it one because

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.970 
couple reasons I like it one because
it's<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.640> easy<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.180> tell<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.990> Formula<00:02:25.710> D<00:02:25.830> if

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it's not so easy to tell in Formula D if

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's not so easy to tell in Formula D if
you<00:02:26.100> fall<00:02:26.340> far<00:02:26.610> behind<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.390> could<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> bit

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
you fall far behind it could be a bit

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.630 
you fall far behind it could be a bit
frustrating<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.460> have<00:02:29.550> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
frustrating because you really have to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
frustrating because you really have to
push<00:02:29.820> yourself<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> catch<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.140> know

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
push yourself to catch up and you know

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.770 
push yourself to catch up and you know
just<00:02:31.740> can't<00:02:32.460> be<00:02:32.580> discouraging<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.540> here

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
just can't be discouraging but here

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.940 
just can't be discouraging but here
you're<00:02:33.930> never<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.320> sure<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.800> you're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you're never really sure if you're

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
you're never really sure if you're
behind<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:35.520> you're<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> different<00:02:35.970> lap

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
behind because you're on a different lap

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.760 
behind because you're on a different lap
than<00:02:36.600> everybody<00:02:36.780> else<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.230> might<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.410> behind

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
than everybody else you might be behind

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.650 
than everybody else you might be behind
the<00:02:37.980> guy<00:02:38.070> racing<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.270> still<00:02:39.510> might

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the guy racing you but you still might

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.170 
the guy racing you but you still might
be<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.900> second<00:02:40.260> place<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.770> whole<00:02:41.070> thing<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
be in second place on the whole thing so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.810 
be in second place on the whole thing so
this<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> whole<00:02:42.690> way<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.890> track<00:02:44.610> is

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
this is the whole way that this track is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.160 
this is the whole way that this track is
there's<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> few<00:02:45.300> special<00:02:45.510> things<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
there's a few special things if you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470 
there's a few special things if you
notice<00:02:46.470> over<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.610> an<00:02:47.940> oil<00:02:48.180> slick

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
notice over here there is an oil slick

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
notice over here there is an oil slick
so<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.290> got<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.530> careful<00:02:49.710> not<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> land<00:02:50.220> in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so you got to be careful not to land in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.700 
so you got to be careful not to land in
that<00:02:50.520> one<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.900> there's<00:02:52.380> some

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
that one over here there's some

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.650 
that one over here there's some
containers<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.640> when<00:02:54.210> you're<00:02:54.330> coming<00:02:54.540> down

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
containers and when you're coming down

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.180 
containers and when you're coming down
here<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.230> better<00:02:55.380> make<00:02:55.590> sure<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.890> don't<00:02:56.070> hit

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.890 
here you better make sure you don't hit
those<00:02:56.460> because<00:02:56.850> that's<00:02:57.030> obstacles<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
those because that's obstacles in the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
those because that's obstacles in the
middle<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> course<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.740> as<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.880> see

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.040 
middle of the course and as you can see
in<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.150> middle<00:03:00.240> section<00:03:00.540> there's<00:03:00.900> two

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
in the middle section there's two

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.680 
in the middle section there's two
different<00:03:01.200> air<00:03:01.550> places<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.970> go<00:03:03.120> all

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
one that I really especially like for

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
one that I really especially like for
beginners<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.700> other<00:03:08.820> track<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.480> is

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
beginners the other track here is

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.140 
beginners the other track here is
Singapore<00:03:10.380> which<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> very<00:03:11.610> dark

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
Singapore which is a very dark

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.820 
Singapore which is a very dark
background<00:03:12.540> at<00:03:13.200> night

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
background at night

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.610 
background at night
very<00:03:14.340> pretty<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.090> very<00:03:15.690> much<00:03:15.750> like<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.440> this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
very pretty I very much like how this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
very pretty I very much like how this
track<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.220> set<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.790> has<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.300> pile<00:03:19.080> of

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
track is set up and it has a pile of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.450 
track is set up and it has a pile of
curves<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.890> fact<00:03:20.040> there's<00:03:20.220> very<00:03:20.250> few

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
curves in fact there's very few

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.790 
curves in fact there's very few
straightaways<00:03:21.240> on<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.600> track<00:03:21.960> so<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.650> hard

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
straightaways on this track so it's hard

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.590 
straightaways on this track so it's hard
to<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.100> get<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.120> nothing<00:03:24.450> is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
to really get going but it's nothing is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.230 
to really get going but it's nothing is
too<00:03:24.950> terribly<00:03:25.950> difficult<00:03:26.160> except<00:03:26.820> maybe<00:03:26.970> this

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
too terribly difficult except maybe this

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.310 
too terribly difficult except maybe this
is<00:03:27.750> dreadful<00:03:28.460> three<00:03:29.460> stop<00:03:30.330> turn<00:03:30.810> here<00:03:31.170> so

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
is dreadful three stop turn here so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.110 
is dreadful three stop turn here so
you'll<00:03:31.860> find<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.430> don't<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.000> you'll

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you'll find it I don't know that you'll

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.450 
you'll find it I don't know that you'll
ever<00:03:33.330> use<00:03:33.690> six<00:03:34.290> steer<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.710> this<00:03:34.860> race<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.370> you

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
ever use six steer in this race and you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.550 
ever use six steer in this race and you
won't<00:03:35.670> be<00:03:35.760> using<00:03:35.900> fifty<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:36.960> even<00:03:36.990> that<00:03:37.320> much

so well and the Singapore track you know
is<00:04:00.210> good<00:04:00.510> enough<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.380> track<00:04:01.680> has

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
is good enough that this track has

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.100 
is good enough that this track has
actually<00:04:02.280> replaced<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.510> track<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.960> you

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
actually replaced the track that you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.540 
actually replaced the track that you
know<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.410> only<00:04:04.470> keep<00:04:04.710> one<00:04:04.770> track<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.460> the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
know you can only keep one track in the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.070 
know you can only keep one track in the
box<00:04:05.760> which<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.090> unfortunate<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.840> wish<00:04:06.960> you

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
box which is unfortunate I wish you

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.950 
box which is unfortunate I wish you
could<00:04:07.200> keep<00:04:07.320> more<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.570> can<00:04:09.690> only<00:04:09.810> keep

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
could keep more but you can only keep

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.930 
could keep more but you can only keep
one<00:04:10.020> track<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> box<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.820> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
one track in the box and so this is the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.520 
one track in the box and so this is the
track<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.420> keep<00:04:12.600> in<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.780> box<00:04:12.990> just<00:04:13.260> because

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.810

convoluted<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.840> complexity<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:17.040> not<00:04:17.480> it

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
convoluted and complexity it's not it

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.450 
convoluted and complexity it's not it
