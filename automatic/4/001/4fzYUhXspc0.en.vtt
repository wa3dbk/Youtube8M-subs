00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
 ... less bumping. 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.800
 Nowadays, that is no longer the case. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.500
 There are still players at IFK who are really wrinkling. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.200
 What do you think about that change (less fights / bangs)? 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.600
 -I don't like it terribly. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.600
 The game was more interesting when IFK was properly banned - 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.900
 and with that style also won a lot of games. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.700
 If you were in a loss, you started to tear, - 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
 the situation improved and the match was won. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 Throughout the ages, IFK has been a rather unruly team. 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.800
 The games have seen countless IFK's stupid heroes. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.600
 It is irresponsible to take off the ice in the attack zone, 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.410
 only a few IFK players have understood it. 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 A sure sign of the beginning of the season is - 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.610
 when Harry Palin will renew his season card. 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 He comes to the back room, even in the middle of a meeting - 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 and tells their views on team composition or gambling. 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 And finally, he sends coaches tips on the power game. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.910
 Don't consider two players on different edges - 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.010
 but two players in the middle and another still in the back. 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 When playing against five of three, two men must always be a wall / mask. 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.110
 It's a day of game again, - 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.720
 and this Tuesday night is facing SaiPa. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 44 years old - 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.020
 is an 84-year-old war veteran, Harry Palin, of IFK's seasonal card. 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.420
 Station A5, line 10, location 172. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.220
 Jan GrÃ¶nroos, his long-standing HIFK supporter, 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.120
 sits tonight at stand C4, line 13, spot 178. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 Does IFK's game match the club's brand today? 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 Let's say 100% ... maybe 80%. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.420
 In 1998, when we last won (championship), it was right. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.420
 Before that, we had a fifteen-year break from 1983. 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 There was quite a roller coaster ride in between. 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.130
 When you enter the IFK's locker room, 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.230
 as you have done countless times - 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.230
 but is it like going to the Vatican? 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930
 I can say that - 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.130
 That every time I open the locker room door it feels good. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 It feels right to me. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.330
 If we are lost, 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.130
 It is a place where you can do something better. 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.830
 And if we are winning the door is usually finished open. 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.540
 Well mites SÃ¶derholm, is she anything? - Yes, he's good. 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.840
 I wouldn't say that just as big a fighter - 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.340
 like Hexi (Riihiranta), Pepe (Lehtonen) and (Juha) Rantasila, 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.240
 but he is a good defender.
