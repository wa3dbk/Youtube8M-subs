00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
wrong with Max's are they mother his
stick<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.990> Klingons<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:40.680> their

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
stick or just like Klingons that's their

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.010 
stick or just like Klingons that's their
idea<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.430> fun<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:42.150> whatever<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
idea of fun time whatever is the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
idea of fun time whatever is the
explanation<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.579> want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> know

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
explanation I don't really want to know

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
explanation I don't really want to know
another<00:01:45.720> interesting<00:01:45.960> conclusion<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.770> came<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
another interesting conclusion I came to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
another interesting conclusion I came to
when<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.549> fighting<00:01:47.790> TR<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.869> first

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
when I was fighting TR you will first

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
when I was fighting TR you will first
thing<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.530> since<00:01:49.740> vs<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.670> colors

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thing that since vs and then see colors

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
thing that since vs and then see colors
are<00:01:51.210> more<00:01:51.390> closely<00:01:51.600> related<00:01:51.869> therefore<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
are more closely related therefore it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
are more closely related therefore it
would<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.070> harder<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> tell<00:01:53.850> them<00:01:54.030> apart<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
would be harder to tell them apart in a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
would be harder to tell them apart in a
huge<00:01:54.840> crowd<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> turn<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:56.399> allow<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
huge crowd which in turn would allow you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
huge crowd which in turn would allow you
to<00:01:56.969> kill<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.420> people<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.990> notice<00:01:58.439> but

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to kill more people and notice but

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
to kill more people and notice but
apparently<00:01:59.159> vs<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> sixth<00:02:00.329> sense<00:02:00.570> which

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
apparently vs have the sixth sense which

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
apparently vs have the sixth sense which
allows<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.290> immediately<00:02:01.710> find<00:02:02.460> me<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
allows them to immediately find me and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
allows them to immediately find me and
make<00:02:03.060> stuff<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:03.689> charriol<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.500> ass<00:02:04.710> or

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
make stuff down charriol to my ass or

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
make stuff down charriol to my ass or
maybe<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.030> dr<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.630> complete

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
