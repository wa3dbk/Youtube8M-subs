patching itself up here or there you
know<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.460> like<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.850> just<00:04:36.090> got<00:04:36.300> shot<00:04:37.070> you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
just got shot six times and you're in

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.140 
just got shot six times and you're in
your<00:04:40.830> trunk<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.220> you<00:04:41.280> got<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.670> gotta<00:04:41.850> but

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
your trunk and you got but you gotta but

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.730 
your trunk and you got but you gotta but
it's<00:04:42.210> okay<00:04:42.540> because<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> case<00:04:43.530> of

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
it's okay because you have a case of

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.550 
it's okay because you have a case of
band-aids<00:04:44.540> well<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.900> keep<00:04:46.080> sticking<00:04:46.320> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
band-aids well and you keep sticking the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.830 
band-aids well and you keep sticking the
band-aids<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.370> running<00:04:47.730> but<00:04:48.630> eventually

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
band-aids on and running but eventually

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.830 
band-aids on and running but eventually
you're<00:04:49.200> gonna<00:04:49.290> bleed<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.650> death<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.190> die<00:04:50.370> and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
you're gonna bleed to death and die and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.190 
you're gonna bleed to death and die and
that's<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.200> think<00:04:52.230> what<00:04:53.010> maybe<00:04:53.880> even<00:04:54.200> Blizzard

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
that's I think what maybe even Blizzard

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.800 
that's I think what maybe even Blizzard
feels<00:04:56.040> like<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.400> going<00:04:56.730> on<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.600> think

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
feels like is going on and so I think

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.050 
feels like is going on and so I think
with<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.530> with<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.860> removal<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.550> Jay<00:04:59.790> Wilson

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
with the with the removal of Jay Wilson

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.000 
with the with the removal of Jay Wilson
implementing<00:05:00.930> some<00:05:01.140> new<00:05:01.260> characters<00:05:01.500> and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
implementing some new characters and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.290 
implementing some new characters and
getting<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.340> thing<00:05:02.400> into<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:02.790> straight<00:05:03.060> path

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
getting this thing into a straight path

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.600 
getting this thing into a straight path
and<00:05:03.600> then<00:05:03.990> simultaneously<00:05:04.500> at<00:05:05.160> one<00:05:05.340> point

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
and then simultaneously at one point

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.460 
and then simultaneously at one point
when<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.150> next<00:05:06.450> eight<00:05:06.600> months<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.380> year

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
when in the next eight months to a year

when in the next eight months to a year
six<00:05:08.220> months<00:05:08.610> whatever<00:05:09.470> dropping<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.940> expansion

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
six months whatever dropping a expansion

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.020 
six months whatever dropping a expansion
and<00:05:12.120> completely<00:05:13.080> flipping<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.860> game<00:05:14.070> upside

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
and completely flipping the game upside
