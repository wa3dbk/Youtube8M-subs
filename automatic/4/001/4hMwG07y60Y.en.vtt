00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.779
 in the front you can get two now 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.030
 Fans from worldwide already 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.169
 preinstalled these aerial photos normally 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.280
 pull the air from the front 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.669
 even if you shut up with the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.800
 Dammmaterial in it means the front can 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.439
 also no sound waves to the user 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.070
 get in and out like this 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.929
 pages 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.929
 you can see that in the video otherwise 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.699
 what are their fed but 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.640
 not behind it but coming in front 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.010
 so that you can protect it from this 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.630
 So in the dust filter in the pipe 17th 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.310
 will not stop the housing barely 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.350
 possible to live out some notes was that 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.850
 I think everything is important but important 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.050
 show that the disc is not outward 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 can come and that whole is insulated 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.920
 ahead 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 On the back are the air intakes 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.820
 be pulled into the housing with air 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.320
 can by the lust ali on the ground 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.550
 can be mounted or alone 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 through the power supply which is mounted on the ground 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.380
 This will also make the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.640
 not directly to the user in the 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.820
 front but we get to the back 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.320
 of course, we have also radiated on 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.970
 Pictures above so that the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 housing berliner pure gold again 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.950
 be protected 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 Incidentally, there are more in the housing cover 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 Fans are mounted that are not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.270
 So fans deserve a short lead 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.890
 are the fan friend and rear on 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.509
 The back is one from above 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.850
 still be staged or a right 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.979
 240 radiator for water cooling 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.539
 the air intakes above are not now 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.460
 just just punched under 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.229
 but are actually sometimes angled 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.340
 if you see alone you hate him so 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.600
 again diagonally to the side so that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.039
 slices are broken there as well 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.840
 can not go straight out again 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.700
 that means we see a lot again 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.430
 made so in the direction of kers must be cooled 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.569
 his must be but at the same time 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.270
 always be taken care of that 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:44.679
 this volume development with the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.119
 of course, the game purely on am 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.690
 housing as the decoupling of the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.190
 festplatten 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.350
 where we recommend very clearly for us 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.890
 sharing system should be installed ssds 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.810
 become 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.159
 there can be two installed here 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.360
 once in the ports one in the second 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.149
 Heat actually at this point 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.500
 would be or on the back where two ssds 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.330
 can always be mounted 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.250
 By the way, you can see on the back 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.750
 the cable management is nice 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.409
 have a lot of cable glands on 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.509
 casing 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.280
 so as much as possible of the cables 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.019
 otherwise you have in the housing around Baumann after 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.079
 can lead behind and for us very much 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.180
 Good airflow and housing ensures 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.790
 Police can put two ssds on bern 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.350
 the front can also be installed two 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.859
 once shown as the hard drive cage 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.109
 Come and meet me for a moment 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.880
 that's what it looks like, of course, from the inside 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.340
 completely insulated hall a small one 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.489
 bauble still installed and although this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.560
 Module can be mounted in two stages 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.910
 either completely solid so on 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.350
 so that no air is drawn in 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.200
 at the height of the graphics card or 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.280
 back at the height of ssds or man 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.810
 it can be up to you 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.230
 You can see that here you are fine 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.569
 you can hide different 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.830
 So I can adjust it myself 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.959
 can's even a stage further off 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.849
 and could optionally also here 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.440
 fan mount again one 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.840
 dust filters are of course already on site 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.459
 that is who two graphic designers answer to 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.450
 example or the ssds were going to be something 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.110
 Anyway i can definitely go for it 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.879
 more air in this great care from the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.170
 I have addressed articles 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.519
 just for the pc games hardware 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.709
 important topic what can not obstruct 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.120
 we can do the cage out just like it 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.590
 now was made under 5 400 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.690
 Millimeter long graphics cards installed 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 become the same theme for a cooler 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.010
 important we build of be quite yes 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.410
 Generally on the flagship series very much 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.569
 big heat sink which is a big one 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.489
 Motive also do not need a cooler here 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.440
 up to a motive of 17 centimeters 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.379
 you are guaranteed to be installed there 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.579
 fits everything 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.379
 Incidentally, we only have if the customer 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.150
 do not want to install a day before pro 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.920
 another one- liners is also a coupling 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.890
 here and the preparatory housing of the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 Power supply also comes complete otherwise 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.430
 we still have guides here 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.800
 if he has external what has been used 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.240
 should 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.280
 a classic frontpanel up here 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.940
 or topp panel what can be served 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.360
 if it is under the table too 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.400
 on housing in three colors from october 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.740
 that means it will be in orange on the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.600
 Market in the beginning in silver migrations 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.590
 run over applications or completely 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.220
 kept in black 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.800
 price is 119 90 and we work 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.750
 whether already on eg side panel with 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.490
 bring windows or that one 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.040
 Travel this colored accent afford 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.040
 quasi reorders thank you
