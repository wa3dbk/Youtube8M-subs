 anacona champions are appearing I think that from the above a large lagoon 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.620
 a product 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.470
 do not like it or not this career made a great career or the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.980

 yes that trajectory with everything 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.290
 mantega bath of the expensive plant 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.690
 it was possibly 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.540
 it ends up doing it until 2 3 seconds of the head that it would be with very nice 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.909

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.909
 they are quite fast in the curve and good step 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.449

 it's very fast they do not stop speeding it up, lack of love and the bike and 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.979
 well the truth 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.299

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.339

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.070
