00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.259 
with groups that's kind of all different
abilities<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.010> they're<00:02:22.610> kind<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
abilities and they're kind of

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.090 
abilities and they're kind of
heterogenous<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.900> group<00:02:24.079> but<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:24.829> in<00:02:24.950> that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
heterogenous the group but then in that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.030 
heterogenous the group but then in that
guided<00:02:25.459> reading<00:02:25.900> center<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.200> me<00:02:27.380> they're

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
guided reading center with me they're

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.770 
guided reading center with me they're
kind<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.340> reading<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.820> same<00:02:29.030> level<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
kind of reading on the same level of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.920 
kind of reading on the same level of
book<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.440> it's<00:02:31.000> equally<00:02:32.000> challenging<00:02:32.630> yet

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
book and so it's equally challenging yet

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.080 
book and so it's equally challenging yet
easy<00:02:33.230> enough<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:33.590> them<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.130> feel<00:02:34.400> confident

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
easy enough for them to feel confident

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.380 
easy enough for them to feel confident
in<00:02:35.299> its<00:02:35.480> success<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.790> those<00:02:37.940> two<00:02:38.000> groups

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
in its success so with those two groups

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750 
in its success so with those two groups
one<00:02:38.810> group<00:02:38.840> was<00:02:39.230> my<00:02:39.739> beginning<00:02:39.920> readers<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
one group was my beginning readers and

they were doing a great job getting one

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.310 
they were doing a great job getting one
to<00:02:43.970> one<00:02:44.090> correspondence<00:02:44.690> reading<00:02:44.959> each<00:02:45.079> word

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
to one correspondence reading each word

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.350 
to one correspondence reading each word
and<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:45.829> just<00:02:46.130> looking<00:02:46.489> at<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.790> picture<00:02:47.090> and
