00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.680
 Greetings from the enjoyment zone we 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.330
 make small breakfast look today 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.010
 that you follow me 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.980
 we have bacon cheese eggs salt 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.580
 pepper and a pinch of sugar flour and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.080
 a little butter for the mini cakes 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.850
 we take a power in the form 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.530
 That is why we have individual ones 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 small and the butter but first off 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 if everything is booted out well take 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 We are a bacon and located 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 here was once sustained outside long 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.580
 so if the shape is designed with bacon 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.290
 has come first to the side 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.290
 then we need two bowls and 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.800
 our eggs for now we start with 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.190
 we will all be part of it 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.190
 separated 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.869
 protein in a larger bowl and that 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.869
 egg yellow in another 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.799
 and then beat the eggs separately 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.799
 the egg white is frothy 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.520
 the mature look but always on 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.520
 instead of 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.530
 so and watch me enough is it if you 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.870
 can almost hold the bowl upside down 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.870
 without what finished 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.080
 so now is the egg yolk turn 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.080
 We also beat it once foamy 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.520
 if that is nice then foamy 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.640
 you can see that the egg yolk is beautiful 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.620
 it gets a bit lighter then 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.310
 Let's go and hear spices now 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 that others with 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.910
 we are that we already have 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.700
 but can not do it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.260
 The idea is to cut it into fine ones 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.610
 cube 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.480
 I have now as cheese I have one 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.030
 melt preparation no real cheese 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 but you can of course in other 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.040
 Take cheese by likes 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.760
 that's why i like the recipe 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.320
 Well, first of all it is a breakfast 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.810
 two aspect and third cheese then 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.810
 the day is actually already saved 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.500
 and in the early morning 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.500
 and now possible 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.540
 so now back to our home there 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:27.640
 we have the egg here we give 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:29.910
 now on it so our flour and the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.910
 cheese 

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:39.249
 now that will be positive with the spatula 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:42.269
 everything under no circumstances underlined the 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.069
 take mixer because then the whole would 

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:47.619
 which we smashed into the protein 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:51.599
 have to go out again and we would have 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:05:00.009
 a liquid mass and rheumatism not 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:05:02.199
 so for a short time the whole agree 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.779
 mixed together that you still there 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.729
 a bit of white yellow has the main thing 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.909
 the air stays in there because of the 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.959
 spices escapes namely the air 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.239
 fast so now we'll see each other ours 

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:19.149
 make shape again 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:25.029
 and now we're going everywhere 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:30.059
 spoon in the form and show the stop 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:30.059
 so that they have something in them everywhere 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:40.990
 and now as I said at 175 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:46.029
 degree top and bottom heat is that in 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.899
 baku about 15 to 20 minutes but that 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.899
 I say the same to you 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:59.199
 so and after exactly 16 minutes well with the 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.520
 chopsticks and that is already done and 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.689
 if only something dry then 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.000
 then it's ready now 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.490
 we just have to cool it down for a moment 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.900
 leave what's left except form and then 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.900
 It also means good appetite
