00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.800
 On June 7, 1692, the port city of Port Royal, a famous pirate haven, sank in its harbor. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.600
 The cause of this disaster (or grace, according to whom the question was asked) was the dilution of the Earth caused by a major earthquake 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.440
 We know that this happened at exactly 11:43 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.130
 This is thanks to a pocket watch that has fallen down to two thirds of the city and more than 2,000 people. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.760
 When water fills the soft soil (which we call "sand"), it becomes transformed into temporary shifting sand. 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.600
 If you look carefully at the sand you will realize that it actually consists of tons of small rocks 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.340
 Their rotation along with their semi-standard size means that there is space between them that can be filled with water. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.059
 As they stepped over the sands on the edge of the water 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.359
 They are perfectly stationary because the particles drive each other and are based on each other 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.999
 While any excess water leaks away where there is less pressure. 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.589
 We can (and did) build buildings over wet sand soil 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.029
 Since the weight of the granules and the amount of friction between them makes the soil look solid most of the time. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.310
 But in case of earthquakes, soil particles move back and forth repeatedly 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.850
 Preventing water from flowing away 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 Free dry soil tends to stack under pressure 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.470
 But with non-compressed water in the spaces between the particles (where they can not leak through) 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.170
 The soil can not stack and the load is placed on the water 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.910
 Unfortunately, water does not have to be a structural fluid 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000
 If saturated soil is forced to stack significantly and very quickly 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 They will act like liquid and will sink dense objects that are now based on sedimentary soil. 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 You can also try to indulge yourself in the sunken sand in the water along the beach 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.299
 You will feel very solid if you stand in your place, but if you shake your fingers a bit the movement 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.990
 It will cause the bottom of you to melt away, burying your feet. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.649
 On a wider scale, lattice-induced earthquakes can swallow cars, roads and even compounds 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.270
 Huge housing. 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.850
 In other words earthquakes can create moving sands 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.730
 Only when the vibration stops does the soil particles become suspended 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.070
 To harden the earth again and suspend all that sank 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.600
 Like the wagon. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
