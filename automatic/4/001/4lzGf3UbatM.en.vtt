00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
like we every year People Mover retired

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.430 
like we every year People Mover retired
and<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.400> know<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.360> team<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.780> always<00:01:59.960> strong

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
and you know the team is always strong

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.950 
and you know the team is always strong
because<00:02:00.770> they're<00:02:01.520> training<00:02:02.120> so<00:02:02.480> good<00:02:02.720> they

work<00:02:06.920> ethic<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.509> think<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.020> goes<00:02:09.440> a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
work ethic and I think that that goes a

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
work ethic and I think that that goes a
long<00:02:09.770> way<00:02:09.979> like<00:02:10.220> that's<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:10.790> know<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.090> reason

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
long way like that's you know a reason

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.270 
long way like that's you know a reason
why<00:02:11.630> they're<00:02:11.870> always<00:02:12.140> being<00:02:12.830> they've<00:02:13.100> always

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
why they're always being they've always

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220 
why they're always being they've always
been<00:02:13.430> good<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> beginning<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
been good in the beginning you know and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.250 
been good in the beginning you know and
it's<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.760> great<00:02:16.850> lead<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.690> they<00:02:17.870> have<00:02:18.020> it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

way<00:02:23.030> down<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.450> our<00:02:23.750> home<00:02:23.900> teams<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.410> we

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
way down to like our home teams like we

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
have a hundred girls try out we take

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.320 
have a hundred girls try out we take
seven<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:27.440> take<00:02:27.680> really<00:02:28.160> good<00:02:28.580> seven<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
seven and we take really good seven and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.300 
seven and we take really good seven and
they're<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.600> ones<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.140> go<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.950> every

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
they're the ones that like go to every

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.490 
they're the ones that like go to every
single<00:02:31.610> practice<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.080> makes<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.350> big

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
single practice like and it makes a big

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140 
single practice like and it makes a big
difference<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:34.100> know<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> cohesiveness
