00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:18.680
 today a new recipe is proposed here to put in the tooth the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 dried meat tartare with candied fruit and mustard to talk about 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.530

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.769
 I blame the reproductive system but we always get in love 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.390
 5 then to the dried meat that has no date announced to the malady 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.950
 I took a picture 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.290
 among the defendants the geographical indication 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.040
 no luck to start a process followed 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.179
 quality standards 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.179
 it's a very complicated process with Afghan women 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.410
 Too much harm to his personal recipe 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.130
 on the other hand for colin firth best man on the comic juppÃ© the material 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.430
 first can not be fully his Swiss consent and I thought 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.830
 maybe not because prices of dried meat still 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.120
 relatively high at the same time the process of preparing the campaign 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.070
 a whole part of the raw material is exactly that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 first of all in relation to the price of the raw material that's good 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 the electors 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.470
 the manufacturing process the best performance in place 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.940
 the agreement of sale from 20 kilos of meat I only carcass in 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.360

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.800
 jay carney 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.590
 we embarked this proud platelet that I take 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.890
 to 2 5 million for me and for my daughter to date to you then it's 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 party launches on leaving the society the pass to ten years no I was 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 surprise 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.759
 with some of the 2 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.670
 the probo koala raw hams and old parmesan it's a program 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.229
 first I'll start with the dried meat tartare and so I 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.139
 prepared my setting up or abroad if very finely assanges 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.789
 cut it's fine that I cut into small squares a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.100
 disaster going on with the knife on a board 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.909
 p she candied fruits with mustard here are the shallots white wine 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.500
 and oil 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100
 and as decoration I grilled tales seeds 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.880
 ok participation of the tartar 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.760
 so I'll start with the tartar 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.330
 so you mix all that in a bowl if you want a little more 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.139
 crocodile in the tartar to the point of putting the biker 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.189
 to figure 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.259
 to find seriously it was worth it I took here 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.299
 then it's the Parisian striker to mix in a nintendo salad bowl 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.009
 put fruit but I think we can also do with vegetables 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.749
 when we arrive in the fall yes then there is an example that is very holy with 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.079
 squash 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.499
 so we make a small mass of diaper hockey with the time he decides 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:38.739
 of vinegar for 300 grams of race to decide 50 grams of sugar 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.900
 a try to pay them at the close of agreement 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.880
 preparing a day for sale against sludge are well accentuate 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.290
 m meanwhile rest while competitors at the stop the state has to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.329
 go back one goal obviously each 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.729
 like 6 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.150
 I take squash seeds 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.760
 songs but three years for decoration 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.950
 it gave a little this side the crunchy I'm slower I'm going over 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.859
 more 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.950
 then 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.529
 I've prepared 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.749
 the color wheel that I'm really pissed off I lie down with an oil 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.749
 olives and white balsamic vinegar clean ones 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 I take pleasure 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.429
 and then after to fresh money and raw ham 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.969
 so so I took a slice 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.619
 major works 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.729
 I cut in four 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.889
 it comes like this 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.749
 and play a role 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.749
 and good for judokas lays in the middle of clothes 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.649
 the old parmesan if chips one point had for example I cut 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:41.599
 with 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.669
 a peeler 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.099
 and Thursday breaks like these sites 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.190
 it's a bit of a balancing act 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.900
 recreativo in a way by when I prepared my 7 already 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.639
 story that we can see the final result 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.079
 he would be quite charming in this match and we could say that to 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.549
 the aperitif for an aperitif has for example smaller arvine a good I do not 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.989

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.939

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.939
 deposited either one believes like these the udc 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.630
 acunetix decoration of the place one goes out one can deposit 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.099
 pressed by rainbow time 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.069
 the Swiss school 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.449
 Whenever this type of time one can imagine the stranger in wider 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.670
 he is more delicate 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.720
 unassisted and 30% 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.970
 it's just the white baguette but you can also take it 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.210
 soul the chopsticks a little more complete 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.580
 take with debates to be a little finer m he cut very fine 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.419
 maximum centimeters 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.930
 like that that's all that's good 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.020
 sometimes 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.129
 if ever what I miss a little to all the questions ever compared 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.949
 to the euro we associate too dry 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.850
 you can baste that the piece toast with a tray a paintbrush and 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.509
 with olives okay that will prevent you from being too dry and well 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.830
 it's always a good learn as a little advice to thank you philippe 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.470

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.300
 that any other question is you can find them also on the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.580
 surface right 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.439
