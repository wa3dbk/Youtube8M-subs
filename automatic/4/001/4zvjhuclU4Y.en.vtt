 good friends excuse the light because it is 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.549
 at night I'm doing the lamb for 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.549
 Christmas Eve dinner 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.330
 and so is I want you to see the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.279
 oven temperature 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.279
 because you are more or less now mark the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.290
 250 one thing yes because it has call 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.750
 live flame 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.560
 and I want you to appreciate, I'm going to try 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.560
 bring the light 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 what do you see 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.880
 you see there is the flame 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.140
 and as I said that with the loaves there 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.019
 I leave flame for the roast yes and here in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.219
 this big fountain I have a rack of 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.460
 ternasco is a Navarran denomination and that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.649
 day is also a shoulder 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.180
 and this is the meat that we are going to eat 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.180
 on this poinsettia 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.310
 as I told you in the recipe 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.100
 and I'll put you on the blog I've just 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 added that in the background of the in the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 bottom of two- pot casserole 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.630
 Water 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.530
 some laurel leaves some rosemary and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.360
 thyme a little salt to the meat and 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:35.310
 nothing more and we will wait as you always see 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.310
 the part of the ribs facing up 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.630
 the first heat stroke agrees that 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.090
 be in that part 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.430
 and then spend an hour and a half one thing 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.409
 so I would turn it around and take it 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.140
 color the other part let's say the part 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.940
 pretty the part of the skin already direct is 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 to the table 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.220
 I'm here at night 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.760
 the night of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.430
 Christmas Eve 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.690
 and this is the lamb roast of Navarre 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.400
 that we will enjoy families 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.269
 then I still do some photos 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.099
 as you will see because as you will understand 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.680
 some days a little delicate for 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.330
 move forward but I will try to leave you some 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.700
 photo or something else 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.620
 in case we do not see each other then wish you a 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.530
 Merry Christmas 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 and the best for next year 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.940
 this year has been a bit regular to see 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.209
 if next it is a little better for 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.209
 everyone 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.730
 good to watch takes like thing of time and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.190
 half a thing without looking since it paints the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.660
 colour 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.200
 already so fabulous 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.209
 of skin 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.700
 I have put him as you see a little paper 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.430
 of aluminum at the end of the leg 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 because as it leaves the source always 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.610
 tends to burn 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.330
 look to put the light well 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.330
 so you can see 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.260
 you see that a smell this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.180
 now I'm going to turn it around and it came to 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.030
 ass that in half an hour more than we were 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.030
 do on the other hand we will not like 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.370
 good friends and you see after half 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.459
 a little more time on this side already 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.959
 we have the roast ready to look what it paints 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.959
 so fabulous that has 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.730
 now I will take a picture of the other source 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.990
 also for you to see 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.160
 you see a plate 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.520
