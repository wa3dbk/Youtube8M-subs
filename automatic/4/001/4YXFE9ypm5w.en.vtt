00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.759 

okay<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:13.459> I've<00:00:13.670> been<00:00:13.790> at<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.030> all<00:00:14.209> day<00:00:14.269> now

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
okay so I've been at this all day now

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.589 
okay so I've been at this all day now
mr.<00:00:15.769> Anderson<00:00:16.160> was<00:00:16.309> here<00:00:16.490> you<00:00:16.610> handed<00:00:17.240> earlier

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
mr. Anderson was here you handed earlier

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.490 
mr. Anderson was here you handed earlier
but<00:00:17.980> he's<00:00:18.980> gone<00:00:19.189> home<00:00:19.400> to<00:00:19.580> have<00:00:19.730> some<00:00:19.939> lunch

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
but he's gone home to have some lunch

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.339 
but he's gone home to have some lunch
we've<00:00:21.640> measured<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.939> deck<00:00:23.150> height<00:00:23.419> of<00:00:23.779> the

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
we've measured the deck height of the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.970 
we've measured the deck height of the
pistons<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.099> the<00:00:25.700> length<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.270> rods<00:00:26.980> and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
pistons and the length of the rods and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.040 
pistons and the length of the rods and
were<00:00:28.130> able<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.430> match<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:29.119> inconsistencies

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
were able to match the inconsistencies

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.920 
were able to match the inconsistencies
and<00:00:30.590> those<00:00:30.770> lengths<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:32.630> create<00:00:32.780> a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
and those lengths to create a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.860 
and those lengths to create a
combination<00:00:33.200> that<00:00:33.800> gave<00:00:34.010> us<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:37.000> 5/100<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.690> a

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
combination that gave us a 5/100 of a

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.209 
combination that gave us a 5/100 of a
mill<00:00:39.140> difference<00:00:39.950> in<00:00:40.270> total<00:00:41.270> deck<00:00:41.570> height

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
mill difference in total deck height

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.819 
mill difference in total deck height
next<00:00:43.219> step<00:00:43.399> then<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.469> weigh<00:00:45.469> everything

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
next step then was to weigh everything

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.279 
next step then was to weigh everything
and<00:00:48.129> try<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.309> match<00:00:49.510> match<00:00:50.510> everything<00:00:50.839> up<00:00:51.079> as

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
and try and match match everything up as

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.829 
and try and match match everything up as
close<00:00:51.589> as<00:00:51.800> possible<00:00:52.269> course<00:00:53.269> being<00:00:53.510> careful

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
close as possible course being careful

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.939 
close as possible course being careful
where<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:53.989> took<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.800> way<00:00:54.920> from<00:00:55.749> obviously<00:00:56.749> the

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
where we took the way from obviously the

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.860 
where we took the way from obviously the
no<00:00:57.949> point<00:00:58.219> taking<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.789> excess<00:00:59.480> weight<00:00:59.659> off<00:00:59.839> of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
no point taking the excess weight off of

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.479 
no point taking the excess weight off of
the<00:01:00.079> bottom<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.499> rod<00:01:00.710> because<00:01:01.129> we're<00:01:01.429> not

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the bottom of the rod because we're not

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.860 
the bottom of the rod because we're not
going<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.760> achieve<00:01:01.909> anything<00:01:02.239> by<00:01:02.329> doing<00:01:02.749> that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
going to achieve anything by doing that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.250 
going to achieve anything by doing that
and<00:01:02.929> probably<00:01:03.229> only<00:01:03.620> weaken<00:01:03.979> it<00:01:05.140> there<00:01:06.140> was

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
and probably only weaken it there was

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.190 
and probably only weaken it there was
about<00:01:07.180> 8<00:01:08.180> grams<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:10.030> difference<00:01:11.030> between<00:01:11.240> the

about 8 grams of difference between the

piston<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:17.479> can<00:01:17.600> see<00:01:17.810> there<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.170> had<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.409> take

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
piston you can see there we had to take

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.700 
piston you can see there we had to take
a<00:01:18.619> considerable<00:01:19.610> amount<00:01:19.899> out<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:20.960> number<00:01:21.350> 2<00:01:21.530> to

a considerable amount out of number 2 to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.149 
a considerable amount out of number 2 to
get<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.840> match<00:01:23.840> up<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.439> other<00:01:24.530> two<00:01:24.829> ear

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
get it to match up at the other two ear

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.969 
get it to match up at the other two ear
I<00:01:25.780> did<00:01:26.780> Lynch<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.170> top<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.530> piston

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
I did Lynch the top of this piston

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.600 
I did Lynch the top of this piston
slightly<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:30.020> bring<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.039> deck<00:01:31.219> here

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
slightly to bring it to deck here
