00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.250
 hi ladder is the right item in the house and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 in the country 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 but usually the stairs take a lot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 places that are completely unacceptable let's say 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.379
 in a one-room apartment 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 there is an alternative 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.330
 compact telescopic articulated 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 werk brand stairs in model 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 There are three models in the werk brand 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.390
 2.9 3.2 high 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 and 3.8 meters number of steps 9 10 and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.190
 12 weight 7 8 and 11 kilograms respectively 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 Folded height 7780 189 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 centimeters it's pretty compact so 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 how all the stairs fit without problems 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 in the trunk of the car this type of stairs 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.950
 can be pushed to a certain 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 number of steps 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 or vice versa as much as possible with smoke for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 easy transportation or storage 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 all models are equipped with reliable 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 metal locks locking 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.109
 devices for fixing the stage also 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 protection against pinching 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.280
 fingers while folding stairs 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 there is a myth that these constructions 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 unreliable we in turn decided 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.040
 disprove this myth and show them 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 obvious advantage 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.159
 I decided to test the reliability of this 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.159
 ladder on his weight 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.870
 as you can see 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.660
 the ladder is secure enough by the way 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.580
 maximum load 150 kilogram a 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.650
 Now consider another construction 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.410
 stairs from the brand werk 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.170
 these are hinged transformer stairs for 3 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.270
 and 4 steps 1 has a maximum height 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.220
 two hundred eighty seven centimeters as 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.810
 step-ladders one hundred forty two centimeters in 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.400
 folded one hundred and five centimeters 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.740
 weight-eight point four 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 kilogram model on 4 steps has 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.160
 maximum height of three hundred and ninety 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.040
 nine centimeters and in the form of a ladder 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.410
 reaches 195 centimeters and folded 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.470
 able 130 cm weight 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.300
 10.4 kilograms both ladders consist of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.040
 Four sections of these stairs can 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 use as added in the form 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.440
 ladders 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.490
 or in the form of a platform thanks 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.810
 well thought out design 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.610
 advanced hinge 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.620
 the connection of the ladder can be set 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.050
 in different positions depending on 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.420
 tasks you can get to the most on 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.490
 first sight hard to reach places like 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.450
 see these designs have a number 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.930
 advantages 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.100
 light weight compactness 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.440
 multifunctionality but reliability i 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.640
 experienced myself so don't believe the myths 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.640
 and successful repair to you
