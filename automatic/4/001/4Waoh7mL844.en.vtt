 a great moment at Oranje nicolas aubin signed this winter at fourth 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.599
 the former kawa driver is now with the french team ktm hdi 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.390
 owner of robin kappel 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 he decided to stay 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.739
 a season of more than 100 mx 2 his last he will be caught from the year 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.509
 next by the age limit 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.560
 a last chance so to win the championship 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.869
 but for now the street 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.970
 this winter the site is full of pitfalls and abandonment on mechanical problem 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.770
 to sommiÃ¨res ask him if he was in training 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
 here it is forced to roll with an intercostal tear even not bad 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500
 I'm careful however the page tight in both runs and the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.960
 phillies at stake in the points I want to be 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 page not to his injuries squeeze it's a little late but here's me I'm a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 pause in the end it does not pose a problem nuance handicap Sunday 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.060
 at the first grand prize and 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.700
 here we are not enough the paf summer at all it goes it gives me even more 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.070
 want to make up for lost time and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.990
 and percent 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 here they are I have nothing 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.370
 in europe it's mentally this 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.030
 because in forced I mean that's what asserted 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 here I want to play want to do battle want to be at the head 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.010
 in front of 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.190
 the now very well surrounded by his side since this winter a certain 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.610
 mickaÃ«l pichon 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.620
 the Sarthe shares his experience of double world champion 250 m2 sixfold 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.550
 champion of France 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.890
 the technical acts of course but also in thales the latter 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 years that was the achilles heel of nicolas aubin 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.620
 well I think he especially needs to regain his level that he had reached 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.470
 4 years old when he made third show of the world 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 % and speed regain its speed which is a little bit lost% and the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.180
 town like wheat on a lot of falls he did a little 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910
 pub at the elbow 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.690
 the place of the season a lot of races he had to give up and so I think 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.600
 that he can already find these tests to find this level and then there 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.050
 lacombe a beautiful fighting spirit that had lost a little bit precisely because 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.450
 of a mind that had taken a little pot 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.729
 I think he has recovered well and that's the side of the physical technique 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.450
 it's not too bad and regaining speed is a mental force that can 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.230
 bring him levasseur on lepi high walk podium with mike quite simple to 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 ps3 and then since early November 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.349
 the report of boko haram 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.849
 it will be felt already this year I think it feels even more 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.209
 on the ground in term 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.500
 the about 800 about 8% have ants in the wrist the winner of 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.099
 enduropal 2010 is currently injured but he has not abandoned the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.569
 motorcycle so far 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.550
 now my career but rather to me even though I always want to 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.429
 when I see the conditions today the pilots for women 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.089
 it annoys me a little bit sprouted on the track but unfortunately it takes 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.469
 turn a little bit there in order to spin the wheel it's like that but percent 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.649
 I did not say my last word I think we can not order between 6% and 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:50.489
 7% a year ago
