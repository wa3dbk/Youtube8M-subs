00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.540
 We're good, I'm fine with you today. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 here with another video and an encore of today 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 will be especially for hairstyles to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.699
 those days that we wake up late and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.890
 we want something very fast in the hair 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.170
 that I did not receive after running all the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.449
 hairstyles if you liked and tell me 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 What was your favorite hairstyle? 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.059
 It's okay, so follow it now. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 step by step of all this hairstyle 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 Good people, you're going to need a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.070
 clamp and an elastic for that first 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 hairstyle 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.289
 we make a tuft just like I showed 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.390
 I understand with white hair now, just to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.199
 Finally I make a ponytail 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 normal very high and leaves the paris 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 in front and with this tuft is a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.540
 ponytail slightly different from the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:11.570
 normal and now it's just learning and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 ready made the first hairstyle 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 now let's go to the second point is the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 second agent with hair all for the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 side and we're literally twisting the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.369
 hair as I'm showing the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 People will twist around the whole way. 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 on the head until you reach the other side 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.890
 So you'll cheer by picking up all the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.070
 wires to move sideways 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.960
 good if not on the side we will join a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.479
 hair on that side with the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.710
 hair that has this side and let's separate 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.630
 a wick to tie this tail 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.290
 horse and you know right? 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.119
 and let's go around because instead of 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.940
 the classic we will make the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.890
 mooring with our own hair and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.440
 now just put the white and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.020
 ready the second one is ready 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.930
 super different hairstyle on the table 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.550
 besides, very quickly to do good. 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.980
 now third 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.330
 despite the elastic and I wear a tie 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.200
 to give a zero differential in the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.269
 hairstyle 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.220
 I'll do the same, I'll get the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.430
 front only a little hair 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.480
 here and I'm going to cheer until the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.820
 half of my head in the end and then 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.100
 in the first moment we arrest with a 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.209
 clip only to ensure 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.120
 While 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.310
 good now on the other side the same thing 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 We put it behind this move. Let's go. 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.590
 twisting halfway and pen let's now 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.260
 with my tie I have here I go 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.860
 take this clamp now you do not need 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.200
 more and more now it just ends 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.959
 learning with a goal or you will catch 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.989
 with elastic and is made that third 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.160
 super gorgeous and super romantic hairstyle 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.030
 cute 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.209
 now we go to the bedroom the bedroom is 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.190
 super simple that the famous braid and that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.560
 I love to do when my hair stops 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.920
 rebel when I'm in a hurry 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.739
 So folks are that famous braid. 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.100
 divided into three parts is hair 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:37.390
 put to the side and in the end is only 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.150
 tie and give the appearance of more 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.280
 stripped us open the braid 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.920
 get a little more loose and ready 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.950
 finalized and now we are going to the fifth 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.810
 we will need three hairstyles 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.680
 it's good because we 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.450
 Let's tie the hair in three parts. 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.239
 starting at the top of the season 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.400
 think as the video shows us 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.060
 Let's hold the top, either. 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.519
 first part and make Nabinho with 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:13.660
 elastic without worry can do 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:15.220
 very quickly and even there, too. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.350
 because the time to do according to 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.060
 I do not want to get the first 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.060
 and then we make the second 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.990
 brand needs to learn to learn a lot 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.810
 sure holds very simple and now the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:37.120
 third rabin do the same thing 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.010
 good now go to the main part of the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.229
 fundamental part of pixar we will not 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.780
 open the first rabin we made 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.669
 split in the middle as well as dead watching 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.669
 I'm going to open it and go down until I get to 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.620
 elastic to have this central space and 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.840
 when I had central space I get in the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.690
 tail and put in the middle 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.870
 In this space and step inside to have 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.889
 this effect also of twisted girls 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.520
 and in the second robot I do the same thing 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:09.400
 open to give a central space and in this 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.550
 space puts the front 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.210
 box here in that space for later 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.180
 to fit the second you were going to see 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.880
 everything is embedded and now it is now that I 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.490
 Second, I'm seeing girls without 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.970
 secrets and now in the end the same thing 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.850
 opens up central space and I put all the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.720
 hair from above that was left inside that 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.260
 space 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.560
 and end up twisting the third rabbit 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.560
 Rabbit, do not go into this space. 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.550
 ready finished people super hairstyle 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.530
 different in the even though you give 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.570
 final set according to the taste of 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.880
 Are you finished with a hairstyle? 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.830
 different and super easy 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.830
 I hope you have enjoyed kisses.
