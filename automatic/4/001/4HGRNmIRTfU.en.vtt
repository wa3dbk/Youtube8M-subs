been training to be here I would say

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.949 
been training to be here I would say
that<00:02:30.900> um<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:33.000> personality<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.900> my

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
that um my personality and my

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.740 
that um my personality and my
performance<00:02:34.620> quality<00:02:34.859> will<00:02:35.760> separate<00:02:36.600> me

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
performance quality will separate me

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.870 
performance quality will separate me
from<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.079> other<00:02:37.140> contestants<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:38.549> all<00:02:38.700> have

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
from the other contestants we all have

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
from the other contestants we all have
something<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.480> unique<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.049> offer<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.920> think

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
something so unique to offer but I think

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.610 
something so unique to offer but I think
that<00:02:41.670> mine<00:02:42.359> is<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.139> performance

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
that mine is really the performance

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680 
that mine is really the performance
aspect<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.549> really<00:02:44.880> love<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.239> be<00:02:45.359> real<00:02:45.660> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
aspect and I really love to be real and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.620 
aspect and I really love to be real and
honest<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.739> dancing<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
honest with my dancing and I think that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.090 
honest with my dancing and I think that
connects<00:02:48.989> best<00:02:49.319> with<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.889> audience<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.609> home

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
connects best with an audience at home

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.330 
connects best with an audience at home

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
at the top of the board and when she

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
like a little cupcake business that we

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.080 
like a little cupcake business that we
were<00:03:38.630> inspired<00:03:38.960> by<00:03:39.050> by<00:03:39.290> Food<00:03:39.500> Network<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.130> we

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
so that's probably something they don't

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.950 
so that's probably something they don't
know
