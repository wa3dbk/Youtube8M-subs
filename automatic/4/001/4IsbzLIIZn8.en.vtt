00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.790
 the prosecution before a media call of 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.119
 possible crimes that allegedly 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.490
 I committed last Saturday in the suburbs 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.710
 of the state congress and if I have committed 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.329
 a crime will surely be to be 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.160
 congruent with my ideas and the one of always 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.540
 to manifest myself in total attachment to 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.660

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.260

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.160
 Mr. Arturo Zamora with a kind 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.719
 of the black durazo of jalisco using a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 the police to politically hit the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.320
 Today begins the persecution 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 policy towards 2015 today we come 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.960
 fiscal to appear as a citizen 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.000
 Today I also come to present before 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 you the license that I asked for as 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.019
 councilor of the san pedro town hall 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.479
 tlaquepaque what I intend is not 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.760
 cover me with the jurisdiction as they do 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.739
 many this is a political movement 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 peaceful and that we come with all the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.420
 quiet to tell you that we are at your 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 orders and that if the Lord receives from 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 your perspective as you declared it today 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 before the media commits a crime 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.940
 that the deputies of the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.970
 citizen movement we said that you 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.550
 We gave the confidence so that I could 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.470
 fulfill the paper assigned to him 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.240
 the prosecution was precisely to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 protect the sexes or the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.800
 deputies or citizen movement has 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.050
 been an obstacle for the prosecution 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.050
 do your work and we think 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.200
 that the best way for the prosecution 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.990
 is given to respect by the jalicienses is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.659
 doing your job well not using 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.140
 the prosecutor's office as a knocking element 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.759
 political because in this case I do not know 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.570
 applied the law in the secrecy of the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.340
 investigation 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.100
 and the next day, rules of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.590
 communication a newsletter allegedly 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.539
 prepared by the prosecution with all the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.179
 information to make a tapping 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.130
 political can not be you the environment 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.659
 public the political pounding and because 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.860
 today we realized that from the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.360
 prosecutor's office is starting a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.619
 political persecution of cutting the rudders 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.330
 since this is not a movement of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.280
 delinquents although you want it 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.050
 convert in this I can understand to that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.430
 they send you they sent it of course to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.780
 distract public opinion from the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.100
 Cubans on Friday with the increase of 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.200
 transportation sizes we are 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.060
 totally committed to the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.190
 legality with the application of the law not 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720
 selective justice beyond 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.370
 look for legal instruments for how 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
 protect us first never committed a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.500
 crime and I did it this Saturday there 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.180
 evidence there are photos and videos 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.980
 where you appear and the only crime 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 what I did was to approach through the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 blows that a lady received on the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.590
 of the elements of the police because 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.480
 there were many families there were children in 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.210
 that space that ran at risk the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.160
 police never defended citizens 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.020
 that were on the street if there were people 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.880
 infiltrated and if they were generating 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.890
 violence did not treat everyone as vile 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.520
 delinquents I think that that is a serious 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.770
 error of whoever intends to apply the law 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.600
 the gentlemen went and said that they 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.890
 infiltrated people from the prosecution I 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.450
 I'm defending a good number of my 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.460
 prosecutor's office and I also have the right to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.280
 defend the name my prosecutor's office I do not know why 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.470
 what you and I do not here have a video 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.410
 of the guests the magazines that are 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.950
 doing kidnapping young people to a 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.720
 red truck researcher why 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.690
 they released us where they are detained 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.370
 in this state there are policemen dressed in 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.170
 civil who then say they are not 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.480
 infiltrators or videos investigate lines 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.130
 where it is said that they can not walk 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.310
 police investigators has been uniform 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.990
 they are entitled to a person's grace 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.970
 grace the question I would ask is where 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.470
 are those young detainees are they 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 released after he has collected that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.310
 fragrance did not commit a crime was a 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.170
 crime that was lost because it was already part 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.720
 and because they are not understood they were liberated 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.030
 because I did not already want local and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.280
 sciences wonder if they turn 10 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.190
 arrest warrants through a window 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.530
 you think it's a way to 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.760
 explain and justify their work and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.810
 all the other criminals in this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.440
 been when they are going to have orders from 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.640
 apprehension 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.830
 I'm not turning 10 orders of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:15.270
 prediction will be rotated will take turns 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.270
 and the judge determines 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:33.420
 they asked the town hall for time
