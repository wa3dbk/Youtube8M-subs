well today we're going to make a very
beautiful<00:00:06.779> paper<00:00:07.379> glider<00:00:07.680> all<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.760> need<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
beautiful paper glider all you need to

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.930 
beautiful paper glider all you need to
make<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> slider<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.110> a4<00:00:10.679> size<00:00:10.950> paper<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
make the slider is a a4 size paper and a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900 
make the slider is a a4 size paper and a
scissors<00:00:12.389> first<00:00:13.139> we'll<00:00:13.530> see<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.460> whole

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
scissors first we'll see the whole

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.330 
scissors first we'll see the whole
making<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.509> decluttering<00:00:16.139> fast<00:00:16.529> motion<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
making of decluttering fast motion and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.179 
making of decluttering fast motion and
then<00:00:17.730> slow<00:00:18.060> motion<00:00:18.539> first<00:00:19.109> fold<00:00:19.590> paper<00:00:19.770> into

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
then slow motion first fold paper into

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
then slow motion first fold paper into
half<00:00:20.220> then<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:21.480> work<00:00:21.630> quarter

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
half then into work quarter

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.519 
half then into work quarter
open<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> then<00:00:24.090> fold<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> 1/8<00:00:25.140> crease

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
open this and then fold the 1/8 crease

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.849 
open this and then fold the 1/8 crease
and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.510> keep<00:00:27.779> folding<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.500> 1/8

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and then just keep folding this 1/8

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.630 
and then just keep folding this 1/8
crease<00:00:29.279> once<00:00:30.060> twice<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.019> three<00:00:31.830> times<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
crease once twice and three times and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.830 
crease once twice and three times and
then<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.770> model<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.670> half<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
then for the model into half with the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
then for the model into half with the
strip<00:00:37.739> inside<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.960> now<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.489> need

strip inside and now this is as you need

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.959 
strip inside and now this is as you need
to<00:00:41.910> cut<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> small<00:00:42.660> strip<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.760> discard<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to cut a small strip and discard this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
to cut a small strip and discard this
strip<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.550> then<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.430> tail<00:00:50.700> wings<00:00:52.430> these

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
strip and then for the tail wings these

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.119 
strip and then for the tail wings these
are<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:53.879> tail<00:00:54.180> wings<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.890> these<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.039> the

are the two tail wings and these are the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.569 
are the two tail wings and these are the
main<00:00:56.340> wings<00:00:57.050> slightly<00:00:58.050> fold<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.890> inwards

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
main wings slightly fold them inwards

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.490 
main wings slightly fold them inwards
the<00:01:00.270> main<00:01:00.480> wings<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> how<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> hold

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the main wings and this is how you hold

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
the main wings and this is how you hold
the<00:01:07.650> glider<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:08.909> gently<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.350> index
