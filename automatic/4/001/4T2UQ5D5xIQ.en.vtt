to<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.600> couple<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.049> brands<00:02:43.410> out

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to it there are a couple of brands out

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
to it there are a couple of brands out
there<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:44.100> using<00:02:44.340> real<00:02:44.610> pomegranate

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
there that are using real pomegranate

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.970 
there that are using real pomegranate
juice<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.989> them<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.320> I'd<00:02:46.440> take<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> look<00:02:46.799> for

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
juice in them so I'd take a look for

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.199 
juice in them so I'd take a look for
those<00:02:47.130> first<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.820> want<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
those first if you want to make it

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.880 
those first if you want to make it
yourself<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> if<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> want<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> make<00:02:49.769> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
yourself but if you want to make it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
yourself but if you want to make it
yourself<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.430> extremely<00:02:51.090> easy<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.780> think

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
yourself it's extremely easy and I think

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.229 
yourself it's extremely easy and I think
taste<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.320> awful<00:02:52.560> lot<00:02:52.680> better<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
taste an awful lot better what I do is I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.300 
taste an awful lot better what I do is I
take<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.720> pomegranate<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.769> seed<00:02:56.130> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
pomegranate underneath it and then just

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.060 
pomegranate underneath it and then just
start<00:03:12.870> working<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.320> out<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:13.769> fingers

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
juice and added a simple syrup is that

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.990 
juice and added a simple syrup is that
that<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> seeds<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.290> seed<00:04:01.500> part<00:04:01.830> not<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that the seeds the seed part not the the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.850 
that the seeds the seed part not the the
red<00:04:03.209> pulp<00:04:03.600> around<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.080> seeds<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> seeds

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
red pulp around the seeds but the seeds

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.380 
red pulp around the seeds but the seeds
actually<00:04:05.190> are<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.670> impart<00:04:05.910> some<00:04:05.970> flavor

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
actually are going to impart some flavor

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.030 
actually are going to impart some flavor
as<00:04:06.599> well<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:07.380> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> be<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.950> a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
as well it's going to be more of a

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.030 
as well it's going to be more of a
character<00:04:09.260> slightly<00:04:10.260> maybe<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> musky

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
character slightly maybe on the musky

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400 
character slightly maybe on the musky
side<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.790> know<00:04:11.880> from<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.150> wine<00:04:12.360> standpoint<00:04:12.959> but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
side you know from a wine standpoint but

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.080 
side you know from a wine standpoint but
I<00:04:13.470> think<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:13.830> adds<00:04:13.980> an<00:04:14.099> interesting<00:04:14.250> character

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
I think it adds an interesting character

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.909 
I think it adds an interesting character
to<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.420> grenadine<00:04:15.810> whether<00:04:16.410> or<00:04:16.500> not<00:04:16.560> sets<00:04:16.799> of

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
to the grenadine whether or not sets of

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.710 
to the grenadine whether or not sets of
a<00:04:17.190> grenadine<00:04:17.609> was<00:04:17.760> originally<00:04:18.180> made<00:04:18.269> or<00:04:18.419> not<00:04:18.510> I

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
a grenadine was originally made or not I

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.280 
a grenadine was originally made or not I
don't<00:04:18.930> know

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
don't know

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.020 
don't know
but<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.070> really<00:04:20.310> takes<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.700> embodies

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
but I think it really takes it embodies

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.110 
but I think it really takes it embodies
what<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> like<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.750> in<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.320> grenadine<00:04:23.120> now

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
what I like to have in a grenadine now

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.210 
what I like to have in a grenadine now
to<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.630> we're<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> take<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.410> add<00:04:25.530> the

to this we're going to take and add the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940 
to this we're going to take and add the
secret<00:04:26.490> ingredient<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.390> that<00:04:27.470> is<00:04:28.470> creme<00:04:28.830> de

sure what it is and then you say well
that's<00:05:14.850> chocolate<00:05:15.330> they<00:05:15.419> go<00:05:15.570> you're<00:05:16.530> right

that's chocolate they go you're right
it<00:05:17.190> is<00:05:17.310> chocolate<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.479> shouldn't<00:05:18.720> stand

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
it is chocolate so it shouldn't stand

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.020 
it is chocolate so it shouldn't stand
out<00:05:19.169> enough<00:05:19.350> so<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.560> notice<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.310> but<00:05:20.970> it

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
out enough so you notice it but it

out enough so you notice it but it
should<00:05:21.090> stand<00:05:21.360> out<00:05:21.539> enough<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.050> can

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
should stand out enough so you can

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
should stand out enough so you can
detect<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.400> in<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.550> background<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.400> saw

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
detect it in the background so you saw

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
since my grenadine was homemade it

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.500 
since my grenadine was homemade it
didn't<00:06:25.040> quite<00:06:25.130> add<00:06:25.340> that<00:06:25.490> bright<00:06:25.910> red<00:06:26.120> color
