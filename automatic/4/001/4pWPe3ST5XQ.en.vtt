00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
today I'm going to be comparing the

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.640 
today I'm going to be comparing the
Samsung<00:00:02.429> gear<00:00:02.580> fit<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.990> Sony<00:00:04.259> SmartWatch

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
Samsung gear fit to the Sony SmartWatch

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:24.220 
Samsung gear fit to the Sony SmartWatch
3<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.220> these<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.939> common

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
3 so what do these do have in common

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.859 
3 so what do these do have in common
well<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.039> all<00:00:26.220> they're<00:00:26.609> both

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
well first of all they're both

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
well first of all they're both
smartwatches<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.800> could<00:00:29.010> say<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
smartwatches you could say that the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.930 
smartwatches you could say that the
Samsung<00:00:30.510> gear<00:00:30.779> fit<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> less<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.430> SmartWatch

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
Samsung gear fit is less of a SmartWatch

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
Samsung gear fit is less of a SmartWatch
because<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.079> classified<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
because it's not really classified as a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.150 
because it's not really classified as a
SmartWatch<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.790> more<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.329> fitness<00:00:36.630> band

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
SmartWatch but more as a fitness band

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
SmartWatch but more as a fitness band
however<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.430> does<00:00:38.640> tell<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
however it does tell you the time and it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.880 
however it does tell you the time and it
basically<00:00:40.530> does<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> things<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
basically does all of the things the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.910 
basically does all of the things the
Sony<00:00:44.190> SmartWatch<00:00:44.460> 3<00:00:44.820> does<00:00:45.090> however<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
Sony SmartWatch 3 does however it just

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.720 
Sony SmartWatch 3 does however it just
doesn't<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
doesn't do it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.630 
doesn't do it
standalone<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.020> always<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
standalone you will always need the in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.510 
standalone you will always need the in
this<00:00:51.420> case<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> Samsung<00:00:52.590> gear<00:00:52.800> fit<00:00:52.860> need

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
this case for the Samsung gear fit need
