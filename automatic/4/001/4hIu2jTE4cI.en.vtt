00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
how bypass surgery works where what are

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
how bypass surgery works where what are
you<00:00:56.489> bypassing<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> what<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> using<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you bypassing and what are you using to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.330 
you bypassing and what are you using to
do<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> bypass

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
do the bypass

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.450 
do the bypass
well<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.989> bypass<00:01:01.500> surgery<00:01:01.980> requires

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
well actually bypass surgery requires

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
well actually bypass surgery requires
you<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> bring<00:01:03.210> blood<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.870> blockages<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you to bring blood around blockages in

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
you to bring blood around blockages in
the<00:01:04.710> arteries<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> heart<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.600> arteries

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the arteries in the heart the arteries

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
the arteries in the heart the arteries
of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> heart<00:01:07.260> supply<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> blood<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
of the heart supply the blood to the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
of the heart supply the blood to the
muscle<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> heart<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.439> those

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
muscle of the heart and when those

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.810 
muscle of the heart and when those
arteries<00:01:10.770> become<00:01:10.950> blocked<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> heart

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
arteries become blocked the heart

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.429 
arteries become blocked the heart
doesn't<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.210> enough<00:01:12.390> blood<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> muscle

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
doesn't get enough blood and the muscle

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.570 
doesn't get enough blood and the muscle
doesn't<00:01:13.619> work<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
doesn't work well and you can have a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
doesn't work well and you can have a
heart<00:01:14.790> attack<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.680> bring

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
heart attack so what we do is we bring

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.560 
heart attack so what we do is we bring
the<00:01:17.220> blood<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> aorta<00:01:19.130> around<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
the blood from the aorta around the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530 
the blood from the aorta around the
blockage<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.710> artery<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.340> typically<00:01:24.330> we

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
blockage to the artery and typically we

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
blockage to the artery and typically we
use<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.900> arteries<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> chest<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> arm

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
use in arteries in the chest and the arm

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
use in arteries in the chest and the arm
or<00:01:26.939> veins<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> leg<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.110> bypasses

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
or veins from the leg for these bypasses

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.789 
or veins from the leg for these bypasses
or<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> combination<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:30.560> understand<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
or a combination I understand you have

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.090 
or a combination I understand you have
to<00:01:31.829> stop<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> heart<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> surgery

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
to stop the heart to do this surgery

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.109 
to stop the heart to do this surgery
well<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.280> several<00:01:35.490> ways<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
well there are several ways to do the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
well there are several ways to do the
operation<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> by

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
operation the way we do it is by

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
operation the way we do it is by
stopping<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.280> heart<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
stopping the heart and what we do is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
stopping the heart and what we do is
we've<00:01:40.320> put<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> patient<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> heart-lung

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
we've put the patient on the heart-lung

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
we've put the patient on the heart-lung
machine<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
machine which is in my back in the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960

operate on and city this is an

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.999 
operate on and city this is an
innovation<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> allowed<00:01:58.110> heart<00:01:58.469> surgery<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
innovation that allowed heart surgery to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.340 
innovation that allowed heart surgery to
occur<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.329> great<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.229> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
occur and the great thing is that we can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
occur and the great thing is that we can
then<00:02:01.469> do<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> perfect<00:02:02.159> job<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:02.909> best

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
then do a perfect job we can do as best

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
then do a perfect job we can do as best
possible<00:02:03.750> job<00:02:03.990> -<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> bypasses

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
possible job - so on the bypasses

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.819 
possible job - so on the bypasses
because<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> size<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.780> these<00:02:06.869> bypasses<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
because the size of these bypasses is

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.100 
because the size of these bypasses is
very<00:02:08.099> small<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.640> only<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.879> millimeter<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.599> 2

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
quite difficult to do

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.750

you<00:03:03.640> know<00:03:03.730> typically<00:03:04.150> if<00:03:05.140> everything<00:03:05.560> goes

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you know typically if everything goes

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.110 
you know typically if everything goes
well<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.220> younger<00:03:06.520> patient<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.090> that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
well on a younger patient like that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.330 
well on a younger patient like that
Cindy<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:08.080> would<00:03:08.230> expect<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.650> patient<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.160> be

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
Cindy we would expect the patient to be

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490 
Cindy we would expect the patient to be
under<00:03:10.060> anesthesia<00:03:10.330> for<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.900> first<00:03:11.170> few<00:03:11.440> hours

care unit and then within 3 or 4 hours
the<00:03:16.480> breathing<00:03:16.810> tube<00:03:16.990> would<00:03:17.110> come<00:03:17.320> out<00:03:17.440> they'd

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
the breathing tube would come out they'd

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.229 
the breathing tube would come out they'd
be<00:03:17.800> extubated<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.640> breathing<00:03:18.880> tube<00:03:19.030> would<00:03:19.120> be

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
be extubated the breathing tube would be

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.030 
be extubated the breathing tube would be
take<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.570> out<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.900> then<00:03:20.350> over<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> next<00:03:20.830> day

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
take it out and then over the next day

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.920 
take it out and then over the next day
or<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.550> start<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.330> out<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.570> bed<00:03:22.720> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
or so they start to get out of bed and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.320 
or so they start to get out of bed and
walk<00:03:23.200> within<00:03:23.950> 3<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.340> 5<00:03:24.580> days<00:03:24.820> they'd<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.180> home

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330

periods of time with certain diets but

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.670 
periods of time with certain diets but
it<00:04:32.669> takes<00:04:32.909> years<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.539> counteract<00:04:34.259> what<00:04:34.529> you

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
it takes years to counteract what you
