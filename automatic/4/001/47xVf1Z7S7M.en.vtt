00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.010
 welcome to a comfortable in the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 video that we are going to see next you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.100
 I'm going to show you how to prepare cupcakes 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.890
 like these you'll see in the video 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.920
 do normal and chocolates is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 a very easy and basic recipe that the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.690
 you can do at home without any problem 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.710
 I hope you like that you try it and 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.000
 let's go with the video 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.379
 for the dough for cupcakes 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.680
 we will need 250 grams of flour a 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.920
 glass and a half of sugar a yogurt 4 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.390
 eggs and half a glass of oil we're going to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 start adding the eggs 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.970
 now we will put the sugar and start 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.970
 shake 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
 contacted 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.970
 and the essence 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 we go 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.800
 and we add the flour little by little 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.800
 to make it easier to mix 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.680
 we say a little and then another little 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.460
 and when you see that you already have more 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.210
 of our consistency we would already have the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.940
 mass to make the cupcakes once 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.040
 let's have the dough done let's go 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.210
 filling in 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.740
 the molds for scooters 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.740
 we will take a spoon 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.260
 little by little we go 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.629
 I do not know 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.720
 and of course 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.230
 better that you want short although 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.170
 after everything has been done 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.470
 or what do you have a little half 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.010
 but they are a little less 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.010
 ah 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.159
 I'm going to make one 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.879
 how many you judge normal and a few 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.980
 of chocolate to make them chocolate 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.160
 simply 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.990
 you have to add to the dough 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.690
 and three teaspoons of cocoa powder 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.070
 according to the intensity of flavor that you want 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.590
 if you want it to have more flavor to 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.960
 chocolate then you put a spoonful 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.450
 more or less that will depend on your 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.240
 taste 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.930
 I 'm going to put two footprints 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.439
 and it will be enough 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.439
 ah 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.370
 we beat it to make it 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.370
 cocoa 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.699
 and we go on 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.290
 a little more 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.610
 Y 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.100
 now it will only be necessary to introduce them in the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.220
 oven that we will have preheated 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.620
 minutes before 170 degrees and the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.620
 we will have about 15 minutes or so
