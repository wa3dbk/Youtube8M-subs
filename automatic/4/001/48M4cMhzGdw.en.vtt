00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
he really believes that I think he just

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.069

generally I completely agree I think it

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.860

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
you can you should never just settle

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:44.950 
you can you should never just settle
with<00:00:43.879> with<00:00:44.239> where<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.600> are<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.929> should

maybe but I also think that he came out
and<00:00:51.769> said<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:52.190> mean<00:00:52.309> he<00:00:52.399> spoke<00:00:52.579> about<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.149> rule

and said I mean he spoke about the rule
that<00:00:53.510> had<00:00:53.600> preceded<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.289> podcast<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.370> said

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
that had preceded that podcast and said

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.099 
that had preceded that podcast and said
we<00:00:56.149> thought<00:00:56.269> I<00:00:56.329> thought<00:00:56.570> today<00:00:56.719> was<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.989> great

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
show and I think you know vast majority

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.560 
show and I think you know vast majority
who<00:01:00.620> saw<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.890> show<00:01:01.039> might<00:01:01.249> not<00:01:01.399> agree<00:01:01.570> though

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
who saw that show might not agree though

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.270 
who saw that show might not agree though

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
frankly it was a bit of it was a bit of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.760 
frankly it was a bit of it was a bit of
a<00:01:04.310> dull<00:01:04.489> three-hour<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.060> quite<00:01:05.210> frankly<00:01:05.540> and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
a dull three-hour it's quite frankly and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.500 
a dull three-hour it's quite frankly and
you<00:01:06.770> know<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.370> suggested<00:01:07.880> he<00:01:08.000> does<00:01:08.240> think

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
you know that suggested he does think

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.810 
you know that suggested he does think
everything<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:08.990> hunky-dory<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.790> I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
everything is hunky-dory and and so I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.910 
everything is hunky-dory and and so I
don't<00:01:11.300> know<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.390> thought<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.810> was<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.470> thought

was an incredible thing for him to say I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.230 
was an incredible thing for him to say I
think<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.620> there's<00:01:15.980> probably<00:01:16.040> some<00:01:17.030> truth

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
think that there's probably some truth

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120 
think that there's probably some truth
to<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.750> mean<00:01:17.870> we<00:01:17.990> can't<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.500> don't<00:01:18.800> know<00:01:18.950> was

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
right to be annoyed with him because if

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.490 
right to be annoyed with him because if
my<00:01:50.120> boss<00:01:50.330> told<00:01:50.540> me<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.990> wasn't<00:01:51.290> doing

back<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.799> Attitude<00:02:22.129> Era<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.400> think<00:02:22.609> and<00:02:22.790> he

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
back to the Attitude Era I think and he

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.550 
back to the Attitude Era I think and he
said<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.269> himself<00:02:23.329> it<00:02:24.049> was<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> completely

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
said it himself it was a completely

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.959 
said it himself it was a completely
different<00:02:24.739> business<00:02:25.010> back<00:02:25.459> there<00:02:25.700> did<00:02:25.879> you

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
different business back there did you

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.550 
different business back there did you
reckon<00:02:26.269> back<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:26.750> they<00:02:26.959> had<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.170> bit<00:02:27.409> a<00:02:27.439> little

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
reckon back then they had a bit a little

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.020 
reckon back then they had a bit a little
bit<00:02:27.680> more<00:02:27.799> creative<00:02:28.340> control<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.879> think

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
bit more creative control do you think

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.020
