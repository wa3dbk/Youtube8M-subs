um think that might be add carrots also
so<00:04:10.570> figured<00:04:11.570> out<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.840> macros<00:04:12.200> for<00:04:12.230> all<00:04:12.500> those

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
so figured out the macros for all those

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.590 
so figured out the macros for all those
individually<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.580> that'll<00:04:14.090> be<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.270> my<00:04:14.390> mind

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600
