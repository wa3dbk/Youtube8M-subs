antioxidant measurement that doctors and
scientists<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> use<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:01.109> measure<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
scientists can use to actually measure a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.299 
scientists can use to actually measure a
rating<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.699> amount<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.359> antioxidants<00:01:04.189> we<00:01:05.189> know

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
rating or amount of antioxidants we know

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
rating or amount of antioxidants we know
how<00:01:05.489> good<00:01:05.670> those<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
how good those are for you so but this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.429

around this is just incredible if he
probably<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.360> good<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> help<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:18.000> 200

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
probably be good to help with 200

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.559 
probably be good to help with 200
different<00:02:19.120> diseases<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.840> would<00:02:19.959> imagine<00:02:21.569> but

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
different diseases I would imagine but

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.690 
different diseases I would imagine but
yeah<00:02:22.750> anyway<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.370> guaca<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.209> see<00:02:25.420> has

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
yeah anyway so the guaca you can see has

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.990 
yeah anyway so the guaca you can see has
more<00:02:27.700> stems<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.530> actually<00:02:29.950> has<00:02:30.310> stemmed

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
more stems this actually has stemmed

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.800 
more stems this actually has stemmed
pieces<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:33.150> bigger<00:02:34.150> chunk<00:02:34.390> sometimes

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
pieces in it a bigger chunk sometimes

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.559 
pieces in it a bigger chunk sometimes
there's<00:02:35.110> some<00:02:35.410> big<00:02:35.650> chunks<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.190> stem<00:02:36.459> which<00:02:37.209> I

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
there's some big chunks of stem which I

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.960 
there's some big chunks of stem which I
don't<00:02:38.170> really<00:02:38.410> think<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.739> stems<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.280> anything

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
don't really think the stems do anything

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.580 
don't really think the stems do anything
I<00:02:40.090> don't<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.299> they<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> purpose<00:02:41.410> being

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
I don't think they have a purpose being

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.910 
I don't think they have a purpose being
in<00:02:41.799> there<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:43.049> what's<00:02:44.049> cool<00:02:44.260> about<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.590> Eco

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
in there and what's cool about the Eco

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.220 
in there and what's cool about the Eco
teas<00:02:45.190> brand<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.599> doesn't<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.079> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
teas brand is that it doesn't have the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.479 
teas brand is that it doesn't have the
stems<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.170> lot<00:02:50.349> cleaner<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.129> product

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
stems it's a lot cleaner of a product

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.490 
stems it's a lot cleaner of a product
you<00:02:51.519> can<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.849> there's<00:02:52.030> no<00:02:52.150> stems<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> it's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
you can see there's no stems in it it's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.960 
you can see there's no stems in it it's
mainly<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.040> leaves<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.250> yeah<00:02:57.609> that's

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
mainly just the leaves so yeah that's

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.280 
mainly just the leaves so yeah that's
for<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.299> most<00:02:58.480> part<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.049> biggest

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
for the most part that's the biggest

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.240 
for the most part that's the biggest
difference<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.920> can<00:02:59.950> see<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.620> Eco<00:03:02.829> teas<00:03:03.040> looks

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
difference I can see the Eco teas looks

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.800 
difference I can see the Eco teas looks
like<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.489> has<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.609> bit<00:03:03.850> more<00:03:04.030> color<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.690> but

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
like it has a bit more color to it but

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.840 
like it has a bit more color to it but
if<00:03:05.650> anything<00:03:06.100> they<00:03:06.310> probably<00:03:06.489> get<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:06.760> from

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
if anything they probably get it from

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.150 
if anything they probably get it from
the<00:03:06.970> same<00:03:07.150> provider<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.959> Eco<00:03:08.500> teas<00:03:08.709> filters<00:03:09.130> I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
Amazon so that's the only bad thing but

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.500 
Amazon so that's the only bad thing but
also<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.319> Whole<00:03:30.280> Foods<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.880> Eco<00:03:31.120> teas<00:03:31.299> is

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
also in Whole Foods the Eco teas is

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.660 
also in Whole Foods the Eco teas is
about<00:03:31.780> four<00:03:32.139> dollars<00:03:32.260> cheaper<00:03:32.650> as<00:03:32.950> well<00:03:32.980> two

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
about four dollars cheaper as well two

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.819 
about four dollars cheaper as well two
to<00:03:33.760> four<00:03:33.940> dollars<00:03:34.030> cheaper<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.810> they're<00:03:35.680> both

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
to four dollars cheaper and they're both

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.099 
to four dollars cheaper and they're both
one-pound<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.000> there's<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.630> exact<00:03:37.930> same

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
one-pound so there's the exact same

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.470 
one-pound so there's the exact same
weight<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.579> is<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:40.120> much<00:03:40.269> more

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
weight so this is actually much more

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.330 
weight so this is actually much more
value<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.079> even<00:03:41.380> more<00:03:41.680> value<00:03:41.950> because<00:03:42.190> it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
value and even more value because it

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.039 
value and even more value because it
doesn't<00:03:42.609> have<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.849> stems

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
doesn't have the stems

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.780 
doesn't have the stems
I<00:03:44.109> would<00:03:44.560> imagine<00:03:44.650> nobody<00:03:45.220> would<00:03:45.370> really<00:03:45.519> need

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I would imagine nobody would really need

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.569 
I would imagine nobody would really need
the<00:03:45.940> stems<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.359> there<00:03:46.569> or<00:03:47.069> want<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.190> stems<00:03:48.400> in
