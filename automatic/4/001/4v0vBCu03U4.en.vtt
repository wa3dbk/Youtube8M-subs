free will quite a while ago

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.060 
free will quite a while ago
um<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:47.390> trying<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.780> get<00:01:48.439> in<00:01:48.590> there<00:01:48.740> than<00:01:48.920> for

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
um I was trying to get in there than for

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.679 
um I was trying to get in there than for
the<00:01:49.100> last<00:01:49.250> couple<00:01:49.430> years<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:50.590> had<00:01:52.329> not<00:01:53.329> played<00:01:53.630> a

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the last couple years I had not played a

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.480 
the last couple years I had not played a
huge<00:01:53.990> number<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.470> these<00:01:54.590> tournaments<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.310> so

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
huge number of these tournaments and so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.940 
huge number of these tournaments and so
so<00:01:58.210> probability<00:01:59.210> wise<00:01:59.479> i<00:01:59.720> guess<00:01:59.899> my<00:02:00.470> time<00:02:00.740> had

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
so probability wise i guess my time had

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.570

first cash being a win is pretty much
the<00:02:07.100> best<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.580> do<00:02:07.729> right<00:02:07.970> not<00:02:08.810> bad<00:02:09.019> not

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
the best you can do right not bad not

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.170 
the best you can do right not bad not
bad<00:02:09.410> at<00:02:09.590> all<00:02:09.739> i<00:02:09.800> was<00:02:10.069> short<00:02:10.340> stack<00:02:10.670> going<00:02:11.030> in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
bad at all i was short stack going in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.080 
bad at all i was short stack going in
close<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.050> money<00:02:12.200> i<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.590> probably<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
close to the money i was probably the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.390 
close to the money i was probably the
bottom<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.510> six<00:02:15.200> or<00:02:15.349> seven<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.830> chips<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
bottom of six or seven and chips and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.640 
bottom of six or seven and chips and
then<00:02:16.489> right<00:02:17.450> after<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.260> money<00:02:18.470> i

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
then right after we got in the money i

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.570 
then right after we got in the money i
was<00:02:18.890> actually<00:02:19.069> stack<00:02:19.970> with<00:02:20.900> about<00:02:21.549> four<00:02:22.549> or

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
was actually stack with about four or

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.870 
was actually stack with about four or
five<00:02:22.700> tables<00:02:23.269> left<00:02:24.069> this<00:02:25.069> about<00:02:25.280> four<00:02:25.549> tables

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
five tables left this about four tables

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.320 
five tables left this about four tables
up<00:02:26.000> because<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.180> would<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:28.299> so<00:02:29.299> I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
up because that would be the and so I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.910 
up because that would be the and so I
had<00:02:29.540> no<00:02:29.569> expectation<00:02:30.410> at<00:02:30.560> getting<00:02:30.769> any

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
had no expectation at getting any

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.460 
had no expectation at getting any
farther<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:31.340> small<00:02:31.940> money<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
farther than small money and so when I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.699 
farther than small money and so when I
kept<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.910> doubling<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.500> cruising<00:02:36.500> through

and there's one over card on board a 9

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.349 
and there's one over card on board a 9
which<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:18.289> may<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.970> also<00:04:19.970> think<00:04:20.120> you

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
which you may have I also think you

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.640 
which you may have I also think you
might<00:04:20.479> have<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.630> seven<00:04:21.079> because<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.470> did<00:04:21.620> not

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
might have the seven because you did not

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.189 
might have the seven because you did not
raise<00:04:21.979> me<00:04:22.190> at<00:04:22.280> any<00:04:22.400> point<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:23.300> looks<00:04:23.930> like<00:04:24.080> you

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
raise me at any point it looks like you

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.320 
raise me at any point it looks like you
might<00:04:24.349> have<00:04:24.380> second<00:04:24.860> pair<00:04:25.009> of<00:04:25.130> seven<00:04:25.490> so

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
might have second pair of seven so

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.390 
might have second pair of seven so
because<00:04:26.750> there's<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.139> chance<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.830> thought<00:04:28.130> I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
because there's that chance I thought I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.790 
because there's that chance I thought I
might<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.840> best<00:04:30.020> hand<00:04:30.259> on<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.530> end<00:04:30.650> I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
might have the best hand on the end I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.170 
might have the best hand on the end I
check<00:04:31.099> it<00:04:31.250> because<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.580> don't<00:04:31.820> have<00:04:31.849> a<00:04:31.940> great

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
check it because I don't have a great

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.779 
check it because I don't have a great
hand<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.570> as<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> six<00:04:33.139> makes<00:04:33.380> us<00:04:33.500> straight<00:04:33.800> so

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
hand and as a six makes us straight so

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.520 
hand and as a six makes us straight so
there's<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.060> one<00:04:35.240> card<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.780> make<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.139> straight<00:04:36.500> A

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
there's a one card to make a straight A

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.279 
there's a one card to make a straight A
six<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.090> very<00:04:38.240> dangerous<00:04:38.539> I<00:04:38.870> check<00:04:39.139> it

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
six so it's very dangerous I check it

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.040 
six so it's very dangerous I check it
and<00:04:39.470> he<00:04:39.620> saw<00:04:39.889> sees<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:41.120> danger<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.750> decides

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
and he saw sees this danger and decides

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.230 
and he saw sees this danger and decides
to<00:04:42.169> shove<00:04:42.500> his<00:04:42.650> chips<00:04:42.949> knowing<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:44.150> a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
to shove his chips knowing that it's a

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.070 
to shove his chips knowing that it's a
huge<00:04:44.539> bet<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.310> most<00:04:46.310> people<00:04:46.639> would<00:04:46.789> fold

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
huge bet and that most people would fold

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.140 
huge bet and that most people would fold
his<00:04:48.080> bet<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.710> almost<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.430> size<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.849> the<00:04:49.940> pot

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
his bet is almost the size of the pot

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.850 
his bet is almost the size of the pot
eight<00:04:50.599> hundred<00:04:50.960> thousand<00:04:51.530> seven<00:04:51.830> hundred

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
eight hundred thousand seven hundred

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.399 
eight hundred thousand seven hundred
thousand<00:04:52.490> seven<00:04:52.820> hundred<00:04:52.849> thousand<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.599> little

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
thousand seven hundred thousand a little

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.870 
thousand seven hundred thousand a little
bit<00:04:54.530> less<00:04:54.680> than<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.889> pot<00:04:55.070> maybe<00:04:55.250> and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.210 

I<00:04:58.620> find<00:04:59.620> it's<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.000> little<00:05:01.000> bit<00:05:01.120> large<00:05:01.360> too<00:05:02.220> large

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
I find it's a little bit large too large

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.920 
I find it's a little bit large too large
a<00:05:03.400> bet<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.820> be<00:05:04.000> out<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:04.540> him<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.750> have<00:05:04.900> a

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
a bet to be out for him to have a

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.450 
a bet to be out for him to have a
straight<00:05:05.290> because<00:05:05.440> feels<00:05:05.950> astray<00:05:06.220> he<00:05:06.310> wants

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
straight because feels astray he wants

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.730 
straight because feels astray he wants
to<00:05:06.520> get<00:05:06.580> paid<00:05:06.760> off<00:05:06.970> he<00:05:07.240> should<00:05:07.420> bet<00:05:07.540> less<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.710> I

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
to get paid off he should bet less so I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.350 
to get paid off he should bet less so I
think<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.190> maybe<00:05:09.790> he<00:05:09.940> doesn't<00:05:10.120> have<00:05:10.330> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
think it's maybe he doesn't have the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.180 
think it's maybe he doesn't have the
straight<00:05:10.750> maybe<00:05:11.290> he<00:05:11.440> doesn't<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:11.920> nine

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
straight maybe he doesn't have the nine

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.690 
straight maybe he doesn't have the nine
maybe<00:05:12.640> he<00:05:12.790> has<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:12.970> seven<00:05:14.280> maybe<00:05:15.280> he's<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.670> a

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
maybe he has a seven maybe he's on a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.780 
maybe he has a seven maybe he's on a
stone<00:05:15.970> cold<00:05:16.210> bluff<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.840> call<00:05:17.500> him<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.310> he
