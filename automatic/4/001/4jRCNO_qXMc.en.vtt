trying to teleport back to base and heal
up<00:04:40.980> by<00:04:41.430> up<00:04:41.670> whatnot<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.290> this<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.560> good

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
up by up whatnot so this is a good

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.800 
up by up whatnot so this is a good
opportunity<00:04:43.920> for<00:04:44.400> Kassadin<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.360> push<00:04:45.600> that

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
gear without having to worry about

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.100 
gear without having to worry about
missing<00:04:52.770> out<00:04:52.890> on<00:04:52.920> a<00:04:53.100> creep<00:04:53.400> wave<00:04:53.990> however<00:04:54.990> I

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
missing out on a creep wave however I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.660 
missing out on a creep wave however I
think<00:04:55.260> we're<00:04:55.560> all<00:04:55.740> aware<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:56.070> what's<00:04:56.310> going<00:04:56.370> to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
think we're all aware of what's going to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.670 
think we're all aware of what's going to
happen<00:04:57.120> Evelyn's<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.200> come<00:04:58.380> up<00:04:58.500> from

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
happen Evelyn's going to come up from

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.510 
happen Evelyn's going to come up from
behind<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:59.630> well<00:05:00.630> gank<00:05:01.260> him<00:05:01.470> because<00:05:02.340> he

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
behind in well gank him because he

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.120 
behind in well gank him because he
thinks<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:02.880> she's<00:05:03.150> back<00:05:03.390> at<00:05:03.600> base<00:05:03.890> now<00:05:04.890> keep

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
thinks that she's back at base now keep

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.860 
thinks that she's back at base now keep
in<00:05:05.280> mind<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:05.880> trick<00:05:06.210> right<00:05:06.450> here<00:05:06.750> is

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
in mind that this trick right here is

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.270 
in mind that this trick right here is
something<00:05:07.230> that<00:05:07.290> you'll<00:05:07.440> probably<00:05:07.740> only<00:05:08.070> get

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
something that you'll probably only get

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.750 
something that you'll probably only get
to<00:05:08.400> try<00:05:08.640> once<00:05:09.060> on<00:05:09.300> somebody<00:05:09.870> before<00:05:10.470> they<00:05:11.340> get

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
to try once on somebody before they get

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.200 
to try once on somebody before they get
wise<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.120> your<00:05:12.600> tricks<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:14.730> hopefully<00:05:14.940> this

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
wise to your tricks so hopefully this

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.730 
wise to your tricks so hopefully this
has<00:05:15.360> been<00:05:15.510> useful<00:05:15.750> hopefully<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.470> learned

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
has been useful hopefully you learned

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.380 
has been useful hopefully you learned
some<00:05:16.890> new<00:05:16.920> things<00:05:17.070> about<00:05:17.370> how<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.670> use<00:05:17.940> Evelyn

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
some new things about how to use Evelyn

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.870 
some new things about how to use Evelyn
stealth<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.950> each<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.550> will<00:05:20.700> now<00:05:20.850> be
