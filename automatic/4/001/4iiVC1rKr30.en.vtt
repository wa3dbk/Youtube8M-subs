I'll<00:00:08.109> add<00:00:08.260> on<00:00:08.379> the<00:00:08.410> trawler<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:08.980> most<00:00:09.160> obvious

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
I'll add on the trawler the most obvious

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.459 
I'll add on the trawler the most obvious
waves<00:00:09.790> we<00:00:10.000> can<00:00:10.150> see<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.629> water<00:00:10.780> waves<00:00:11.170> like

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
waves we can see the water waves like

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.740 
waves we can see the water waves like
these<00:00:11.650> ripples<00:00:12.039> out<00:00:12.400> here<00:00:12.610> on<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:12.820> lake<00:00:12.850> but

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
these ripples out here on the lake but

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.510 
these ripples out here on the lake but
as<00:00:13.900> far<00:00:14.049> as<00:00:14.110> the<00:00:14.379> troll<00:00:14.770> amun<00:00:14.980> are<00:00:15.100> concerned

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
as far as the troll amun are concerned

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.550 
as far as the troll amun are concerned
perhaps<00:00:16.449> more<00:00:16.630> important<00:00:17.140> at<00:00:17.289> least<00:00:17.440> for

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
perhaps more important at least for

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.380 
perhaps more important at least for
their<00:00:17.650> safety<00:00:17.920> are<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.520> invisible<00:00:18.970> waves<00:00:19.180> the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
their safety are the invisible waves the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.410 
their safety are the invisible waves the
ways<00:00:19.510> we<00:00:19.690> can't<00:00:19.900> see<00:00:20.170> like<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.700> radio<00:00:22.090> waves

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
ways we can't see like the radio waves

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.640 
ways we can't see like the radio waves
which<00:00:22.750> are<00:00:22.870> used<00:00:23.110> in<00:00:23.290> their<00:00:23.410> global

communications equipment and in their
radar<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.880> then<00:00:28.539> there's<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.990> sound<00:00:29.260> waves

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.440 
radar and then there's the sound waves
used<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:29.980> their<00:00:30.130> sonar<00:00:30.400> for<00:00:30.789> detecting<00:00:31.240> fish

but<00:00:31.720> once<00:00:31.900> again<00:00:32.050> they're<00:00:32.739> invisible<00:00:33.100> so<00:00:33.789> it's

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
but once again they're invisible so it's

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.790 
but once again they're invisible so it's
rather<00:00:34.090> difficult<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.660> really<00:00:35.350> see<00:00:35.620> what's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
rather difficult to really see what's

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.620 
rather difficult to really see what's
going<00:00:36.100> on<00:00:36.220> if<00:00:36.880> we're<00:00:37.030> going<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.270> get<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.540> the

up<00:01:55.690> there<00:01:56.690> were<00:01:56.840> many<00:01:57.050> ways<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.500> signaling<00:01:58.010> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
up there were many ways of signaling to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.040 
up there were many ways of signaling to
another<00:01:58.460> boat<00:01:58.700> but<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.840> days<00:02:00.020> before

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
another boat but in the days before

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.160 
another boat but in the days before
radio<00:02:00.860> if<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.250> wanted<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.729> chat<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.690> only<00:02:03.050> way

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
radio if you wanted a chat the only way

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.520 
radio if you wanted a chat the only way
to<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.649> was<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.100> shout<00:02:05.140> right<00:02:06.140> well<00:02:06.410> if

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
to do it was to shout right well if

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.200 
to do it was to shout right well if
you're<00:02:06.679> going<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.979> give<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.340> your<00:02:07.490> radios<00:02:07.970> we'd

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
you're going to give up your radios we'd

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.960 
you're going to give up your radios we'd
better<00:02:08.390> test<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:08.929> lung<00:02:09.289> power<00:02:09.970> gone

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
better test out your lung power gone

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.310 
better test out your lung power gone
there<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.930> still<00:02:15.140> hear<00:02:15.260> me

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
there you go can you still hear me

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.090 
there you go can you still hear me
playing<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.340> stake<00:02:16.990> he<00:02:17.990> got<00:02:18.170> me<00:02:18.350> Neil<00:02:18.560> yeah

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
playing the stake he got me Neil yeah

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.240 
playing the stake he got me Neil yeah
I'm<00:02:19.580> kidding<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.800> how<00:02:21.800> are<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.980> still

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
I'm kidding you how are you still

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.390 
I'm kidding you how are you still
getting<00:02:22.370> me<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:23.030> getting<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.570> fine<00:02:24.400> so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
getting me I'm getting your fine so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.130 
getting me I'm getting your fine so
they're<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.700> using<00:02:25.910> radio<00:02:26.390> waves<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.840> talk

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
they're not using radio waves to talk

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.140 
they're not using radio waves to talk
now<00:02:27.350> but<00:02:27.530> they're<00:02:27.710> still<00:02:27.740> using<00:02:28.100> waves<00:02:28.520> sound

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
now but they're still using waves sound

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.900 
now but they're still using waves sound
waves<00:02:31.210> yes<00:02:32.210> I'm<00:02:32.480> still<00:02:32.690> getting<00:02:32.900> your<00:02:33.110> Neil

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
waves yes I'm still getting your Neil

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.160 
waves yes I'm still getting your Neil
the<00:02:34.910> problem<00:02:35.180> with<00:02:35.300> sound<00:02:35.540> waves<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:36.020> that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the problem with sound waves is that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
the problem with sound waves is that
they<00:02:36.260> spread<00:02:36.530> out<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.860> all<00:02:36.920> directions<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.819> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
they spread out in all directions so the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.700 
they spread out in all directions so the
further<00:02:38.150> away<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.510> are<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.230> faint<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
further away you are the faint of the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.370 
further away you are the faint of the
sound<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.190> also<00:02:40.940> sound<00:02:41.450> gets<00:02:41.660> absorbed<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
sound is also sound gets absorbed in the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.530 
sound is also sound gets absorbed in the
air<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.800> if<00:02:43.190> you're<00:02:43.310> outside<00:02:43.460> then<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.330> wind

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
air and if you're outside then the wind

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.390 
air and if you're outside then the wind
blows<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.960> air<00:02:44.990> around<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.860> sounds<00:02:46.160> even

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
blows the air around and the sounds even

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.590 
blows the air around and the sounds even
harder<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.850> hear<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.790> still<00:02:50.000> hear<00:02:50.210> me<00:02:50.270> now

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
harder to hear can you still hear me now

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.370 
harder to hear can you still hear me now
you're<00:02:51.200> getting<00:02:51.530> fainter<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.970> are<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.380> you're

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
you're getting fainter so are you you're

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.840 
you're getting fainter so are you you're
gonna<00:02:54.500> have<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.770> start<00:02:55.010> shouting

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
gonna have to start shouting

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.170 
gonna have to start shouting
haha<00:02:56.770> while<00:02:57.770> they<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.310> with<00:02:58.460> shouting<00:02:59.060> at

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
haha while they get on with shouting at

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.840 
haha while they get on with shouting at
each<00:02:59.360> other<00:02:59.510> let's<00:02:59.870> talk<00:03:00.230> sound<00:03:00.680> sound<00:03:01.610> waves

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
each other let's talk sound sound waves

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.490 
each other let's talk sound sound waves
are<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.390> hard<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.690> see<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> way<00:03:03.320> they

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
are really hard to see but the way they

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.460 
are really hard to see but the way they
work<00:03:03.710> is<00:03:03.920> almost<00:03:04.100> like<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.580> sleeping

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
work is almost like this sleeping

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.200 
work is almost like this sleeping
imagine<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.710> moment<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.220> these<00:03:07.550> slinky

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
imagine for a moment that these slinky

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.290 
imagine for a moment that these slinky
links<00:03:08.600> are<00:03:08.750> individual<00:03:09.560> air<00:03:09.800> molecules<00:03:10.460> if<00:03:11.000> i

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
links are individual air molecules if i

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.120 
links are individual air molecules if i
put<00:03:11.570> in<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.750> bit<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.930> oscillation<00:03:12.620> at<00:03:12.740> this<00:03:12.890> end

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
put in a bit of oscillation at this end

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.610 
put in a bit of oscillation at this end
you<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.450> energy<00:03:14.630> travels<00:03:15.410> down<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
you can see the energy travels down to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.440 
you can see the energy travels down to
the<00:03:15.890> other<00:03:16.040> end<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.640> spring<00:03:16.850> as<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> wave

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the other end of the spring as a wave

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.200 
the other end of the spring as a wave
and<00:03:18.260> that's<00:03:18.440> how<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.740> voice<00:03:19.010> works<00:03:19.370> when<00:03:20.090> you

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
and that's how you voice works when you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.350 
and that's how you voice works when you
speak<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.170> tiny<00:03:21.560> scale<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.520> air<00:03:22.730> molecules

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
speak on a tiny scale the air molecules

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.390 
speak on a tiny scale the air molecules
push<00:03:23.750> into<00:03:23.990> their<00:03:24.260> neighbors<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:24.920> then

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
push into their neighbors and then

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.670 
push into their neighbors and then
bounce<00:03:25.580> back<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.020> your<00:03:27.140> voice<00:03:27.350> travels

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
bounce back and so your voice travels

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
bounce back and so your voice travels
through<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.130> air<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.670> compression<00:03:29.270> wave

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
through the air like a compression wave

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.250 
through the air like a compression wave
as<00:03:31.700> I'm<00:03:31.910> talking<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:32.600> producing<00:03:32.960> a<00:03:33.050> sound

the wave travels now sound travels find
through<00:03:54.020> air<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.440> travels<00:03:54.770> even<00:03:55.010> quicker

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
through air but it travels even quicker

through solids such as metal that's why
if<00:03:58.190> you're<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.490> tube<00:03:58.670> station<00:03:59.120> you'll<00:03:59.240> hear

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
if you're in a tube station you'll hear

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.850 
if you're in a tube station you'll hear
the<00:03:59.510> sound<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.930> the<00:03:59.990> train<00:04:00.230> coming<00:04:00.530> along<00:04:00.740> the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the sound of the train coming along the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.950 
the sound of the train coming along the
tracks<00:04:01.160> before<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.120> hear<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.420> sound<00:04:02.690> through

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
tracks before you hear the sound through

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.350 
tracks before you hear the sound through
the<00:04:03.050> air<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:04.190> perhaps<00:04:04.370> one<00:04:04.640> way<00:04:04.790> our<00:04:04.940> fishermen

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
the air so perhaps one way our fishermen

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.720 
the air so perhaps one way our fishermen
could<00:04:05.540> do<00:04:05.690> better<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.230> with<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:06.980> old<00:04:07.100> tin<00:04:07.490> can

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
could do better is with the old tin can

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.600 
could do better is with the old tin can
telephone<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.810> speak<00:04:09.050> into<00:04:09.260> one<00:04:09.470> end<00:04:09.680> sound

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610

wave<00:04:10.820> travels<00:04:11.240> along<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> string<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.050> it's

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
wave travels along the string and it's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.200 
wave travels along the string and it's
heard<00:04:12.650> at<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.830> other<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:13.670> maybe<00:04:13.850> that's<00:04:14.060> not

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
heard at the other but maybe that's not

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.000 
heard at the other but maybe that's not
too<00:04:14.390> practical<00:04:14.600> out<00:04:14.930> at<00:04:15.110> sea<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:15.620> our

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
too practical out at sea so our

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
too practical out at sea so our
fishermen<00:04:16.430> will<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.760> think<00:04:16.940> of

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
fishermen will have to think of

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.289 
fishermen will have to think of
something<00:04:17.210> a<00:04:17.359> bit<00:04:17.450> better<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.620> age<00:04:18.770> to<00:04:19.299> speak

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
something a bit better the age to speak

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.720 
something a bit better the age to speak
at<00:04:20.450> see<00:04:20.660> basically<00:04:21.170> were<00:04:21.650> only<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.190> tin<00:04:22.460> trumpet

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
at see basically were only a tin trumpet

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.090 
at see basically were only a tin trumpet
I<00:04:23.060> mean<00:04:23.420> apart<00:04:23.510> from<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.960> voice<00:04:24.110> itself<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
I mean apart from the voice itself the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.800 
I mean apart from the voice itself the
Tim<00:04:25.310> trumpet<00:04:25.700> would<00:04:25.820> focus<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.300> sound<00:04:26.480> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
Tim trumpet would focus the sound and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.440 
Tim trumpet would focus the sound and
help<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.500> carry<00:04:28.010> over<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.460> water<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.970> bit

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
help it carry over the water a bit

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.300 
help it carry over the water a bit
better<00:04:29.630> than<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.560> straightforward<00:04:30.830> shirt

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
better than just a straightforward shirt

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.940 
better than just a straightforward shirt
it's<00:04:32.270> not<00:04:32.390> any<00:04:32.600> better<00:04:34.030> yes<00:04:35.030> that's<00:04:35.420> better

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
it's not any better yes that's better

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.710 
it's not any better yes that's better
one<00:04:36.950> way<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.130> make<00:04:37.460> shouting<00:04:38.060> work<00:04:38.210> better<00:04:38.480> is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
one way to make shouting work better is

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.930 
one way to make shouting work better is
to<00:04:38.810> use<00:04:39.140> one<00:04:39.350> of

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
to use one of

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.720 
to use one of
thank<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.810> very<00:04:40.840> much<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.380> loudhailer<00:04:41.980> stops

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
thank you very much a loudhailer stops

the<00:05:08.050> problem<00:05:08.380> shouting<00:05:08.620> between<00:05:08.950> boats<00:05:09.400> is

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
the problem shouting between boats is

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.010 
the problem shouting between boats is
that<00:05:09.790> you've<00:05:09.940> got<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.120> lot<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.330> noise<00:05:10.600> going<00:05:10.630> on

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
that you've got a lot of noise going on

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.690 
that you've got a lot of noise going on
in<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.230> background<00:05:11.410> is<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.160> wave<00:05:12.340> noise

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
in the background is that the wave noise

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.850 
in the background is that the wave noise
is<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.030> wind<00:05:13.300> noise<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.810> there's<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:14.770> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
is the wind noise and there's just a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.810 
is the wind noise and there's just a
question<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:15.280> whether<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.610> really

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
question of whether you really

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.490 
question of whether you really
understand<00:05:16.330> what's<00:05:16.570> being<00:05:16.720> said<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.110> when<00:05:17.410> you

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
understand what's being said in when you

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.410 
understand what's being said in when you
hear<00:05:17.740> it
