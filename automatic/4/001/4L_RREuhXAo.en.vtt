this<00:00:42.060> means<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.630> take<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.110> less<00:00:43.290> bullet

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
this means it will take one less bullet

this<00:00:51.570> rate<00:00:51.810> of<00:00:51.930> fire<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.140> effectively<00:00:52.829> lower<00:00:53.100> I

estimate<00:00:54.300> around<00:00:54.780> 525<00:00:55.880> this<00:00:56.880> makes<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> saber

I<00:02:18.240> found<00:02:19.140> these<00:02:19.260> two<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.920> effect

due to the burst firing so you should

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
due to the burst firing so you should
spend<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.590> search<00:02:22.740> elsewhere<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.520> then

so the chances of being at discounted

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.100 
so the chances of being at discounted

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
to its low dps and even at long range it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.170 
to its low dps and even at long range it
