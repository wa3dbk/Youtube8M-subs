00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 there is an insurance that puts game in case you 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.030
 break the console to the back 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.899
 a lot 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.410

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.090
 the ambassadors program that does not 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.330
 called here come the typical codes 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.290
