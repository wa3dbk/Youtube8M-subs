00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
from these headphones I think it's like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.709 
from these headphones I think it's like
the<00:01:18.929> sound<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.509> don't<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.570> it's

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
the sound is a little I don't know it's

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.319 
the sound is a little I don't know it's
like<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.670> guess

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
like it's like a little kind of I guess

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.980 
like it's like a little kind of I guess
you<00:01:24.600> could<00:01:24.749> say<00:01:25.189> muddy<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.689> little<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.869> know

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you could say muddy or a little you know

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.169 
you could say muddy or a little you know
it's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.920> say<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> claim<00:01:29.609> to<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.789> clear

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
it's not they say they claim to be clear

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's not they say they claim to be clear
but<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.719> have<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.469> klipsch<00:01:31.770> image<00:01:32.990> s4
