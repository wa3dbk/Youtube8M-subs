00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.860 
good in fashion history repeats itself
and<00:02:26.769> this<00:02:27.459> concept<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.269> goes<00:02:28.420> back<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and this concept really goes back to the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.890 
and this concept really goes back to the
ancient<00:02:28.900> Egyptian<00:02:29.709> times<00:02:29.920> okay<00:02:30.880> except<00:02:31.510> for

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
ancient Egyptian times okay except for

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.229 
ancient Egyptian times okay except for
purity<00:02:32.530> has<00:02:32.739> anti-inflammatory<00:02:33.430> properties

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
purity has anti-inflammatory properties

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.770

so if you have rosacea or acne you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.240 
so if you have rosacea or acne you
really<00:02:38.260> don't<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> worry<00:02:38.799> about<00:02:38.920> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
really don't have to worry about it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.199
