seem to be going pretty well we went out

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.899 
seem to be going pretty well we went out
and<00:01:14.810> made<00:01:14.869> our<00:01:15.020> first<00:01:15.290> up<00:01:15.590> pass<00:01:15.890> at<00:01:16.130> 190<00:01:16.729> miles

and made our first up pass at 190 miles
an<00:01:17.030> hour<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.080> was<00:01:18.229> very<00:01:18.500> happy<00:01:18.979> with<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.130> I

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
an hour and I was very happy with that I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.740 
an hour and I was very happy with that I
figured<00:01:19.820> there<00:01:19.939> was<00:01:20.060> more<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.360> come<00:01:20.540> because

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
figured there was more to come because

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.469 
figured there was more to come because
uh<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.320> couldn't<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.490> RPM<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:22.940> was<00:01:23.240> looking

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
uh I couldn't get the RPM I was looking

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.160 
uh I couldn't get the RPM I was looking
for<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.720> was<00:01:23.810> stuck<00:01:24.440> about<00:01:25.539> 12,000<00:01:26.539> 250<00:01:27.020> or<00:01:27.140> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
for it was stuck about 12,000 250 or so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.399 
for it was stuck about 12,000 250 or so
and<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:28.369> would<00:01:28.549> call<00:01:29.270> from<00:01:29.570> stuttered<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.200> I

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and it would call from stuttered and I

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.139 
and it would call from stuttered and I
figured<00:01:30.710> well<00:01:30.860> or<00:01:31.070> something<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.939> know<00:01:32.030> I'll

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
figured well or something you know I'll

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.090 
figured well or something you know I'll
find<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.570> there's<00:01:32.840> some<00:01:33.289> simple<00:01:33.770> explanation

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
find it there's some simple explanation

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.859 
find it there's some simple explanation
for<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:37.270> look<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.509> look<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.810> I

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
for this and I look and I look and I

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.719 
for this and I look and I look and I
look<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.289> keep<00:01:39.710> changing<00:01:40.130> things<00:01:40.460> and

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
look and I keep changing things and

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.820 
look and I keep changing things and
trying<00:01:40.970> things<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.080> speeds<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.590> start

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
trying things and the speeds to start

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.219 
trying things and the speeds to start
coming<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.580> rpm<00:01:44.000> seems<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.479> be<00:01:44.600> stuck<00:01:45.020> at

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
coming the rpm seems to be stuck at

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.080 
coming the rpm seems to be stuck at
12,000<00:01:46.119> so<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.630> guess<00:01:48.520> out<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.580> desperation

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
12,000 so I guess out of desperation

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.820 
12,000 so I guess out of desperation
alone<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.509> finally<00:01:51.110> said<00:01:51.289> you<00:01:51.409> know<00:01:51.440> what<00:01:51.679> I've

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
alone I finally said you know what I've

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.180 
alone I finally said you know what I've
got<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.009> spare<00:01:52.490> ECU<00:01:53.200> let's<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.470> change<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
got a spare ECU let's just change the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.399 
got a spare ECU let's just change the
whole<00:01:55.310> management<00:01:55.819> package<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.600> go<00:01:56.750> back<00:01:56.929> to

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
whole management package and go back to

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.100 
whole management package and go back to
a<00:01:57.440> known<00:01:58.340> good<00:01:58.729> unit<00:01:59.149> maybe<00:01:59.659> I've<00:01:59.899> got<00:02:00.049> a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
a known good unit maybe I've got a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.490 
a known good unit maybe I've got a
corrupted<00:02:00.679> one<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.209> we<00:02:02.209> changed<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.869> when

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
corrupted one and we changed it and when

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.499 
corrupted one and we changed it and when
I<00:02:03.560> started<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.039> engine<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.459> morning<00:02:04.850> it

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
I started at the engine this morning it

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.770 
I started at the engine this morning it
sounded<00:02:05.959> smoother<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.310> another<00:02:08.119> bubble<00:02:08.390> of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
sounded smoother so another bubble of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.370 
sounded smoother so another bubble of
Hope<00:02:09.140> rises<00:02:10.239> at<00:02:11.239> Bonneville<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:11.989> don't<00:02:12.320> know

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
Hope rises at Bonneville I don't know

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.720 
Hope rises at Bonneville I don't know
whether<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.680> gonna<00:02:12.769> pay<00:02:13.010> off<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.519> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
whether it's gonna pay off or not but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.830 
whether it's gonna pay off or not but
we're<00:02:13.820> gonna<00:02:13.910> go<00:02:14.090> give<00:02:14.269> it<00:02:14.359> a<00:02:14.390> try<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.780> see

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
we're gonna go give it a try and see

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.100 
we're gonna go give it a try and see
what<00:02:15.049> happens
