00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
storable I think and there it isn't at

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.600 
storable I think and there it isn't at
the<00:02:43.110> moment<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.470> we'll<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.280> next

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
in both single-player and online so for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.620 
in both single-player and online so for
some<00:03:22.890> reason<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.400> actually<00:03:23.970> can't<00:03:24.210> see<00:03:24.450> as

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
some reason you actually can't see as

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.180 
some reason you actually can't see as
far<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.230> used<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.650> able<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.040> in

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
online and single player I think that

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.450 
online and single player I think that
could<00:03:28.350> be<00:03:28.500> because<00:03:28.650> they've<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.220> added

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
could be because they've actually added

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.150 
could be because they've actually added
a<00:03:29.970> slide<00:03:30.480> fog<00:03:31.050> in<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.530> or<00:03:31.680> they've<00:03:31.830> added

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
a slide fog in there or they've added

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.730 
a slide fog in there or they've added
the<00:03:32.580> actual<00:03:32.820> ability<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.570> fog<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.080> GTA<00:03:34.560> 5
