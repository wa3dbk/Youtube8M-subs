00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 look at this as he wrote it on twitter 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 they are historical moments without president 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.059
 is right then because the boss 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.309
 been the Vatican so are things very 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 incomprehensible what the paper f a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.610
 church also is head of state but 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 good 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.430
 they are historical references that also 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.329
 they maintain by romanticism in any case 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 It is a good news 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.770
 incredible for latin america I 'm going to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.259
 go to the pope's position personally 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.910
 has never been 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.670
 buildings none of that no but this 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.380
 this event has such a transcendence for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.840
 Latin America that I think is 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.760
 relevant in my presence in Rome 'I am 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.059
 Catholic practitioner but in a state 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.440
 layman that's to be very limited but it's 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.300
 the fact of having a dad 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 Latin American that's something historic 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.920
 unprecedented 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 puts a world-wide lecture this 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.380
 region that has 40% of Catholic America 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.910
 latina not to question much like 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.560
 Catholic because Latin America from region 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.000
 most catholic in the world there was the region 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.510
 most unequal in the world something is 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.670
 failing and I have a lot of faith as 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.640
 catholic because I respect dad very much and if 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.130
 I was not out too but I have a lot of faith in 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.330
 dad francisco first you are 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.250
 imagine what you can converse with a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 Pope in Spanish who knows where he is 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.780
 Ecuador probably knew who the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.460
 president of the equator who knows the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.950
 reality that he has visited as five 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.110
 Sometimes the guayaquil country we have friends 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 common you know what you can 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.270
 talk that evokes june tied 0-0 with 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.530
 barcelona in the cup liberators a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.570
 European pact that will understand those 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 things do not know Latin America then 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 the transcendence of this I think not what 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.060
 we have known 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.700
 size in its just magnitude and month 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.040
 it's something unprecedented I see a lot 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.810
 hope and I have a lot of faith in francisco 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340
 already started that has been related to 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.990
 the dictatorship has just been lying 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.420
 Nobel Prize winner adolfo pÃ©rez esquivel 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.400
 Argentine who always fought against the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.890
 repressors of that country that is a dad 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.470
 conservative the same simple of 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.360
 Monsignor Oscar Arnulfo Romero Archbishop 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.860
 of the savior when they named him 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.600
 archbishop president was because he was 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 conservative and I will do hello did 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.170
 so many waves that killed him I have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.530
 much faith in francisco has given samples 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.790
 marvelous his papacy began a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.920
 humility without precedent a program 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.320
 Jesuit create the Jesuit his preparation 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 spectacular intellectual is academic 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.670
 also from academic preparation 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.130

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.740
 has a life testimony of very many 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.300
 Simplicity has rejected the luxuries that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 they usually surround the role of the Vatican 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.920
 that for ordinary Christians are a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.350
 half incomprehensible luxury takes you with 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.380
 much hope the present and the future 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.010
