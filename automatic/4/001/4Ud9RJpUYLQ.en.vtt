00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.059
 hello very good girls and that the carol 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 martins a in the blog pink code and today 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.609
 I'm back here with another tutorial 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 one month 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.310
 This time I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.269
 francesinha matinho negra francesinha is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 This one from here she is strength with the tips 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.940
 shining can use black enamel 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.040
 commonplace, which is what is shameful and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 there you have to use another enamel that is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 a sport that the opposite effect or 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.760
 you can use the black enamel you already 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.420
 is matte and pass the extra brightness in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 tips 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 I do not have matte black enamel and have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.469
 the common black males only that I have the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.280
 enamel that gives effect to any 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.230
 co 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 I find it more advantageous because you go 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.539
 need to buy multiple matte colors 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 to pass the streets you buy the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.859
 enamel as you are and against the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 matte enamel and passes through 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.159
 Any glaze I know will leave 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 matte effect also on the nails 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.500
 Is this boy so notorial I've tried 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.490
 actions to advance the process 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 so you're going to have to do this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.619
 entering is just the first training she 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 forget to spend the base years to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.979
 protect the lines of other right 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 and we will now go over the enamel 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.930
 effect that is what is going to give 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 Amazon Matte effect 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.869
 this is the matte cover glaze 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.770
 color 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:41.479
 So let's go, you'll see that the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.479
 matte effect is very fast 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.670
 good girls the first layer stays like this 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.850
 you can see that you are still evaluating 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.619
 a little bit but it is much weaker 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.640
 so I'm going to go through another layer of 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.640
 to be well fans 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.170
 so far they are a little bit longer 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.630
 force 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.909
 I think it's beautiful, it's made mostly in the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.849
 black and now I will pass the black enamel 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.060
 again it is to be a part of children '' 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.989
 continuous glossy black francesinha 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.870
 matte you decide that the thickness 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.400
 Do you want to do the French ? 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.360
 make more or less this thickness here and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.670
 Then you can pass a file or 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.450
 two layers 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.450
 I'll spend another one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.850
 and stayed like that, it gets much less in my 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.390
 so let's continue to do in all 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.390
 the other lines 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.270
 The little French girl was beautiful and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.500
 it's a luxury 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.950
 so you have seen that it is very easy to 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 do 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.090
 do and it's very cool to see the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.120
 matte enamel matte covering 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 nails is but if you are in a 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.270
 Frosted black enamel, you just pass 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.340
 on the tips pass the extra enamel 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.280
 brightness or else I think common black 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.790
 even then stay here close to you is 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.410
