you watched my previous episode you will
know<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.579> I've<00:01:20.939> been<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.810> stupid<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.649> I've

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
know that I've been very stupid and I've

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.600 
know that I've been very stupid and I've
neglected<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:24.210> thought<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.719> have<00:01:25.110> enough<00:01:25.610> elixir

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
neglected I thought I have enough elixir

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.749 
neglected I thought I have enough elixir
storage<00:01:27.210> capacity<00:01:27.899> but<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.439> realized<00:01:29.399> later

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
storage capacity but I realized later

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
storage capacity but I realized later
that<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.630> needed<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> upgrade<00:01:31.439> one

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that I actually needed to upgrade one

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.780 
that I actually needed to upgrade one
more<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:33.090> level<00:01:33.780> 11<00:01:34.219> which<00:01:35.219> I'm<00:01:35.460> doing<00:01:35.640> right

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
more to level 11 which I'm doing right

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.670 
more to level 11 which I'm doing right
now<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:36.810> could<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.259> max<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.000> six<00:01:39.000> million

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
now so i could have max of six million

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.440 
now so i could have max of six million
elixir<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.549> need<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.270> not

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
elixir and that's what I need so I'm not

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
elixir and that's what I need so I'm not
using<00:01:42.659> jams<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.289> could<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.649> should<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:43.920> but

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
using jams I could have should have but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.600 
using jams I could have should have but
I<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> use<00:01:45.750> gems<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.219> I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I do not want to use gems for that so I

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
I do not want to use gems for that so I
am<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.420> day<00:01:48.570> away<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:49.530> starting<00:01:49.890> my

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
am one day away from starting my

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.490 
am one day away from starting my
balloons<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.729> am<00:01:51.060> hoping<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> 6<00:01:52.259> million

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
balloons I am hoping to get to 6 million

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.270 
balloons I am hoping to get to 6 million
elixir<00:01:53.039> in<00:01:53.219> one<00:01:53.490> day<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.630> doable

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
elixir in one day I think it's doable

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
elixir in one day I think it's doable

think this is a good design similar

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.849 
think this is a good design similar
thing<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.519> he's<00:03:57.269> also<00:03:57.510> boosting<00:03:58.199> all<00:03:58.379> of<00:03:58.620> his

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
thing and he's also boosting all of his

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.970 
thing and he's also boosting all of his
collectors<00:03:59.699> which<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.120> awesome<00:04:00.590> if<00:04:01.590> only<00:04:01.829> I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
collectors which is awesome if only I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.400 
collectors which is awesome if only I
found<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.370> base<00:04:02.609> maybe<00:04:02.879> 3-4<00:04:03.419> hours<00:04:03.810> after<00:04:04.260> he

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
found this base maybe 3-4 hours after he

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.050 
found this base maybe 3-4 hours after he
logged<00:04:04.620> off<00:04:04.859> would<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.370> been<00:04:05.519> even<00:04:05.730> better

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
