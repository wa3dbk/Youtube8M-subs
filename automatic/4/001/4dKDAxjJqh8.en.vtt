fusion<00:03:59.630> we<00:03:59.959> got<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> crystal<00:04:00.590> can<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.220> use<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
fusion we got the crystal can we use it

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.920 
fusion we got the crystal can we use it
on<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> red<00:04:01.880> guy<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:03.380> vargas<00:04:03.860> here<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:05.630> goes<00:04:05.810> to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
on a red guy see vargas here it goes to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.720 
on a red guy see vargas here it goes to
80<00:04:06.140> when<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.590> wouldn't<00:04:06.800> be<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.890> bad<00:04:07.100> option<00:04:07.310> I

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
80 when I wouldn't be a bad option I

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.580 
80 when I wouldn't be a bad option I
really<00:04:08.209> should<00:04:08.360> use<00:04:08.480> them<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.750> Phoenix<00:04:09.170> he

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
really should use them in the Phoenix he

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.090 
really should use them in the Phoenix he
needs<00:04:09.770> some<00:04:09.920> levels<00:04:11.590> let's<00:04:12.590> use<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.800> on<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
needs some levels let's use it on the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.860 
needs some levels let's use it on the
Phoenix<00:04:15.340> all<00:04:16.340> right<00:04:16.519> crystal<00:04:18.250> 220<00:04:19.250> cheese

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
Phoenix all right crystal 220 cheese

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.460 
Phoenix all right crystal 220 cheese
insane

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.840

that's it that's it
and<00:04:28.330> some<00:04:29.050> point<00:04:29.230> using<00:04:29.410> him<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.860> doesn't

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
and some point using him it doesn't

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.190 
and some point using him it doesn't
increase<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:31.050> alright<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:34.210> probably<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.720> 35

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
increase it alright but probably like 35

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.200 
increase it alright but probably like 35
something<00:04:35.890> like<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.190> if<00:04:36.490> I'm<00:04:36.670> lucky<00:04:36.850> oh<00:04:39.210> no

something like that if I'm lucky oh no

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.770 
something like that if I'm lucky oh no
boost<00:04:42.810> 43<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.350> close<00:04:45.120> some<00:04:46.120> nice<00:04:46.270> boost<00:04:46.540> own

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
boost 43 I was close some nice boost own

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.260 
boost 43 I was close some nice boost own
stats<00:04:47.170> there<00:04:47.440> I'll<00:04:47.620> take<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:49.060> needed

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
I don't think the boost is up I can't

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.300 
I don't think the boost is up I can't
read<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.120> for<00:05:05.480> crap<00:05:05.750> though<00:05:06.130> alright<00:05:07.130> guys
