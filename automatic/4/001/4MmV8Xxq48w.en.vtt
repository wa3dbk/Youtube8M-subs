00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 in the degrees as you are comrades of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.250
 youtube system 4 I bring a new video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.809
 and until we are in high picture no 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 I wanted to bring a little variety to the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.080
 channel and we're going to a tdt run 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 because I have not yet climbed on my channel like this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.520
 what are we going to have to see if there 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.520
 some room wizards not 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.240
 william but there are few good people I'm going to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 do one better thing I'm going to put here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.450
 I'm going to do like this and I'm going to do like this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 that we return when it is in some one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.579
 sand say it like that and I come back with the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 recording until another one better said until 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 now good guys we are here in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 this sand that is filling up was going to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 start soon apparently to start 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.210
 pretty soon and well I do not know if I'm 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.670
 good or bad because I played maximum 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 four times in this in this tnt run 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.560
 so let's see let's see how it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.620
 gives us 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 valeri to seconds 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.610
 and start this so we're going to go and 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 so I do not want to fall 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.910
 I want to fall is to go for it by the sides 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.170
 because that's where good people are 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.540
 where does it go better because if you go 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.320
 doing round circles I would be left 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.190
 they are already falling around me 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.440
 you do not leave me and you are not worth 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.690
 because I speak because I speak I do not know why 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.820
 I speak so I also think that it is better 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.000
 walk 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.700
 because if you walk you do not have much 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 risk of falling and you have like more time 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.350
 to react so let's see for 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.340
 here is where people get ahead and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.970
 that's how to say it makes me 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.300
 fall 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.850
 it's just worth they have died 4 fuck 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.229
 how fast people are dying so 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.790
 let's try to be among the five 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.050
 First that's my challenge, said God 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 mine so 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.030
 he has spent if he has been the last 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.890
 jump the double jump forgiveness has 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.819
 spent yes, because I do not want to fall 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.540
 see I do not want to fall to perfect to see 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.540
 let's go here 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.500
 my god is that when you think that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.380
 also the bad thing about not running is also 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.240
 that fuck to see 12 we have to stay 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.780
 among the first 5 guys is that if not 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.780
 it's not funny 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.950
 or I do not know how I saved myself from that I do not know 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.950
 how I did it 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.830
 we are 12 here the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.830
 I included myself 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.269
 I do not know how good I came welding of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.719
 this is going so fast because I am 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.549
 it's not worth we have been eighths good I think 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.579
 I'm going to make another game because this one 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.459
 Chubut came out a little, so we went 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.150
 we see in the other game now until 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.159
 now my god that does not come out 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.409
 and well guys we are already here in another 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.690
 sand more or less I think it's the same and 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:21.950
 well, so we have to run 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.740
 voucher voucher voucher voucher voucher 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.140
 let's run and now we start going for the 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.290
 edges that is the best thing is that I do not want 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.570
 nor jump jump not please to see that 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.610
 do not come before us because they're going 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.740
 to throw rod there are people down perfect 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.420
 brave above those in front who are 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.360
 they have fallen so we are going to go through here and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:47.330
 let's go around better give the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:50.840
 back bouncing pom pom pom pom pom lo 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.450
 I did not know is that people go through 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.580
 in front of me and that confuses me because I do not 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.520
 I want them to shoot me and then 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.290
 confused to see if this time we can 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.420
 to be among the first is that is that 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.950
 I'm very bad at this so I'm 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.260
 seeing I'm very bad I'm going to make a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.990
 technique that nobody knows what it is that you're going 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.730
 over here and up to at least one 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.160
 time you feel like it is a time you 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.410
 you win because people never go for the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.389
 means and I believe that by the middle it is for 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.359
 where you should go first go 17 characters 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.539
 it's worth nothing 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.409
 no god of mine I've done the spent one 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.449
 double holy saint not because I spend it 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:34.550
 it was spent for nonsense so 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.550
 this is that I want to dodge this 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.090
 no no no no it's not that I'm getting 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.710
 my god is worth 10 10 10 10 we have to 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.680
 ride a little more guys a little more 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.889
 years between the first five please 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.650
 and here we are going to go slow so that the 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.720
 people give him time to fall if a little 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.639
 selfish but it does not matter 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.830
 country pa country country country 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.419
 slow here and from here people have 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.009
 used the trick 7 we can stay 5 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.479
 we can stay before the first five 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.550
 nine that doing illusions because 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.529
 when I do them, I always go outside 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.659
 6 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:20.459
 and go to one more and that is not me please 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.459
 or got him in a mess 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.850
 It has gone perfect perfect wow 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.730
 what tension please what tension to see 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.070
 around here around here over here 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.290
 I'm getting into places where I do not 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.480
 I should poke though it does not sound very good 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.750
 what I am saying but it does not matter 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.070
 it's around here we come back because 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:48.970
 If we do not finish the bargain and we're going 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.740
 here around here around here 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.120
 let's go we go here and go 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.120
 earning five 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.770
 well we have already been between the five 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.590
 perfect we have been among the five 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.420
 rather said the 5 but it does not matter that 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.090
 was the goal not among the five 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.330
 is already between the five and well let's 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.070
 do leaf dif I do not think it's anything like that 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.070
 that the live and we're going to go to a 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.100
 esquinita marginalized right here here 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.230

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.630
 let's do it like that and it's good that I hope 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.790
 that you liked the video today and 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.610
 so I do not upload video is very very 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.650
 recently because good actively 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.540
 rather, because apart from that I'm 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.760
 in 4th of that and whether studying is doing 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.220
 see yourself studying the exams as well as 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.550
 which are quite and difficult and many 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.460
 during the week and well then I'll try 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.530
 upload more videos so one day I will record 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.330
 enough videos and something else that 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.340
 I wanted to say because I'm jumping 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.530
 that did not mean the look but it's that 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.170
 I do not know why he was jumping and because 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.290

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.000
 that I fall and good that the series I recorded the 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.740
 first episode and it was the why I deleted 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.580
 all files unintentionally because I am 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.229
 a little 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:12.409
 cazurro erased them with seacleaner and good 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.509

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.639

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:20.139
 you give daily and we see each other in another 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.139
