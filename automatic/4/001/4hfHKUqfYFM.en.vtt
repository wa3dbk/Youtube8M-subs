00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
made an impact but I think the reason

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.170 
made an impact but I think the reason
why<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> weave<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.920> hell<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> big<00:02:41.880> fan

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180

the<00:06:12.000> way<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.210> see<00:06:12.660> that<00:06:12.900> in<00:06:13.110> Rooney<00:06:13.500> that's

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
the way you see that in Rooney that's

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.710 
the way you see that in Rooney that's
why<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.460> think<00:06:14.669> Rooney's<00:06:15.270> in<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.540> midfield

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
why I think Rooney's in the midfield

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.140 
why I think Rooney's in the midfield
because<00:06:16.290> he<00:06:16.470> leads<00:06:16.770> by<00:06:16.919> example<00:06:17.070> he's<00:06:17.850> got<00:06:18.030> the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
because he leads by example he's got the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.790 
because he leads by example he's got the
strength<00:06:18.450> being<00:06:18.810> there<00:06:19.080> he's<00:06:19.470> got<00:06:19.680> the

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
strength being there he's got the

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.860 
strength being there he's got the
quality<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.430> I<00:06:20.970> can't<00:06:21.240> see<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.690> from

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
quality and I can't see that from

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.690 
quality and I can't see that from
anybody<00:06:22.260> else<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.919> midfield<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.430> look<00:06:23.580> on

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700
