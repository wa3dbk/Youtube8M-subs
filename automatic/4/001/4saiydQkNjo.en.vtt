just<00:01:18.150> mean<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> change<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.960> formation<00:01:19.620> has<00:01:19.800> been

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
just mean a change of formation has been

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.040 
just mean a change of formation has been
an<00:01:20.130> agent<00:01:20.400> tries<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.330> make<00:01:21.480> sense<00:01:21.510> of<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
an agent tries to make sense of that

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.070 
an agent tries to make sense of that
change<00:01:22.460> that's<00:01:23.460> great<00:01:23.730> support<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
change that's great support way from the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.290 
change that's great support way from the
rest<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> team<00:01:25.710> he's<00:01:26.070> only<00:01:26.190> picked<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.670> an

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
rest of the team he's only picked out an

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.770 
rest of the team he's only picked out an
opponent<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.870> that<00:01:27.930> cross

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.430

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
Challenge made on the slide it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.540 
Challenge made on the slide it's
probably<00:01:38.810> just<00:01:39.530> about<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.070> edge<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.400> the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
probably just about on the edge of the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.400 
probably just about on the edge of the
range<00:01:40.940> from<00:01:41.060> which<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.570> expect<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.050> score

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
range from which you can expect to score

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.790 
range from which you can expect to score
but<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.980> odds<00:01:43.130> against<00:01:43.610> him<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:45.530> might<00:01:45.680> have

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
but the odds against him it might have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.710 
but the odds against him it might have
been<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.950> foul<00:01:46.190> but<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.520> referee<00:01:46.670> says<00:01:47.120> you've

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
been a foul but the referee says you've

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.860 
been a foul but the referee says you've
got<00:01:47.750> an<00:01:48.020> advantage<00:01:48.290> on<00:01:48.620> you<00:01:48.770> go

in<00:02:35.299> on<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.659> slide<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:36.319> think<00:02:36.739> this<00:02:36.859> team<00:02:37.099> are

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
in on the slide I do think this team are

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.280 
in on the slide I do think this team are
clever<00:02:37.760> when<00:02:37.939> they<00:02:38.090> do<00:02:38.150> attack<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:39.109> like

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
clever when they do attack just like

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.069 
clever when they do attack just like
this<00:02:39.499> they're<00:02:39.739> trained<00:02:39.920> well<00:02:40.689> shots<00:02:41.689> on<00:02:41.870> here

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
this they're trained well shots on here

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.179 
this they're trained well shots on here
the<00:02:42.590> service<00:02:43.129> was<00:02:43.400> superb<00:02:44.030> shot<00:02:45.019> wasn't<00:02:45.230> there

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
the service was superb shot wasn't there

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.610 
the service was superb shot wasn't there
you<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.549> on<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:46.879> plate<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:48.230> couldn't<00:02:48.499> take

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
you go on a plate just couldn't take

00:02:48.620 --> 00:03:01.370 
you go on a plate just couldn't take
advantage

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.610 

and<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.010> goes<00:03:02.160> sliding<00:03:02.940> it

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.589 

position<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.770> handball<00:03:11.160> well<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.940> coaching

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
position for handball well in coaching

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.600 
position for handball well in coaching
position<00:03:13.080> isn't<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.709> when<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.310> look<00:03:14.459> at

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
position isn't it and when you look at

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.010 
position isn't it and when you look at
it<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:15.090> referee<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.540> made<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> right

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
it I think the referee is made the right

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:25.900 
it I think the referee is made the right
call
