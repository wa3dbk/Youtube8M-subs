00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
just going to see this they're going to
think<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.200> decoration<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.219> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
think that's decoration and all that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.410 
think that's decoration and all that
they're<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> click<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:59.270> they're<00:02:00.270> going

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
they're going to click it they're going

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.649 
they're going to click it they're going
to<00:02:00.479> hear<00:02:00.719> something<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:02.450> they're<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.540> going

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to hear something but they're not going

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.370 
to hear something but they're not going
to<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
to know what the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.020 
to know what the
so<00:02:06.380> they're<00:02:06.710> basically<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.520> leave<00:02:07.760> and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so they're basically going to leave and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.730 
so they're basically going to leave and
then<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.300> roam<00:02:08.539> around<00:02:08.569> trying<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.500> grieve

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
then just roam around trying to grieve

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.160 
then just roam around trying to grieve
somewhere<00:02:10.069> else<00:02:10.190> but<00:02:10.520> since<00:02:11.510> you're<00:02:11.660> smarter

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
somewhere else but since you're smarter

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.620 
somewhere else but since you're smarter
and<00:02:12.350> you're<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:13.160> one<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.400> set<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:16.630> you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
can see this there's water how do you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.449 
can see this there's water how do you
get<00:02:19.819> up<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:19.940> though<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.950> what<00:02:22.130> this

make<00:02:36.220> basically<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.489> button<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.030> like

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
make basically with the button it like

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.660 
make basically with the button it like
switches<00:02:38.840> its<00:02:39.110> kind<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.620> at<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:40.070> kind<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.519> makes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
a button turn into like a switch where

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.340 
a button turn into like a switch where
it<00:02:43.489> stays<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.570> what<00:02:45.170> you're<00:02:45.260> going

water that's why I used a black wall up
there<00:03:25.640> frigate<00:03:26.510> kind<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.870> like<00:03:27.079> camouflage

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.789 
um but yeah it's really simple to make
guys<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:54.049> took<00:03:54.350> me<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.560> while<00:03:54.739> to

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
guys just that this took me a while to

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.620 
guys just that this took me a while to
get<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.910> little<00:03:56.890> little<00:03:57.890> push<00:03:58.790> up<00:03:59.090> thing<00:03:59.450> for

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
get this little little push up thing for

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.000 
get this little little push up thing for
it<00:03:59.690> could<00:03:59.780> be<00:03:59.870> compact<00:04:00.290> from<00:04:00.530> what<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.769> have<00:04:00.890> to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
it could be compact from what I have to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.720 
it could be compact from what I have to
do<00:04:01.100> like<00:04:01.220> little<00:04:01.519> stairways<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.359> redstone<00:04:03.109> so

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
do like little stairways of redstone so

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.210 
do like little stairways of redstone so
basically<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.450> tea<00:04:05.630> flop<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:07.130> those

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
basically this is the tea flop for those

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.810 
basically this is the tea flop for those
that<00:04:07.250> didn't<00:04:07.640> know<00:04:10.359> okay<00:04:12.220> basically<00:04:13.220> when<00:04:13.669> you

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
that didn't know okay basically when you

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.990 
that didn't know okay basically when you
when<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.239> push<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.540> button<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.609> switches<00:04:16.609> and

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
when you push a button it switches and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.960 
when you push a button it switches and
that<00:04:17.930> causes<00:04:18.620> I'll<00:04:19.280> just<00:04:19.579> do<00:04:19.699> it<00:04:19.730> on<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.000> side

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
that causes I'll just do it on this side

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.770 
that causes I'll just do it on this side
um<00:04:23.020> that<00:04:24.020> causes<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.650> since<00:04:25.040> there's<00:04:25.310> a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
um that causes it since there's a

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.900 
um that causes it since there's a
there's<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.930> redstone<00:04:27.440> torch<00:04:27.680> right<00:04:28.100> here<00:04:28.340> when

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
there's a redstone torch right here when

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.390 
there's a redstone torch right here when
it<00:04:29.060> closes<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.630> powers<00:04:29.930> up<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:30.800> um<00:04:31.040> this

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
it closes it powers up this this um this

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.840 
it closes it powers up this this um this
block<00:04:32.360> which<00:04:32.780> makes<00:04:33.290> this<00:04:33.650> activate<00:04:34.610> and

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
block which makes this activate and

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.350 
block which makes this activate and
which<00:04:35.150> activates<00:04:35.780> all<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.370> which<00:04:37.370> released

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
which activates all that which released

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.290 
which activates all that which released
is<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.870> sticky<00:04:39.139> piston<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.650> close<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:40.300> then

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
is the sticky piston to close and then

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.610 
is the sticky piston to close and then
to<00:04:41.479> reopen<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.080> that's<00:04:42.260> what<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.560> about

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
to reopen so that's what I like about

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.960 
to reopen so that's what I like about
the<00:04:42.889> tea<00:04:43.070> flop<00:04:43.310> it's<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:44.449> um<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:46.280> acts<00:04:46.610> like<00:04:46.820> a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
the tea flop it's that um it acts like a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.840 
the tea flop it's that um it acts like a
lever<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.690> don't<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.169> have<00:04:48.199> a<00:04:48.320> lever

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
lever so you don't have to have a lever

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.879 
lever so you don't have to have a lever
it's<00:04:49.850> really<00:04:50.090> awesome<00:04:50.330> really<00:04:51.290> great<00:04:51.500> really

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
it's really awesome really great really

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.280 
it's really awesome really great really
compact<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:53.389> can<00:04:53.419> make<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.810> even<00:04:54.110> more

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
compact you can make this even more

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.200 
compact you can make this even more
compact<00:04:54.860> just<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:55.190> don't<00:04:55.430> know<00:04:55.699> how<00:04:55.880> at<00:04:56.060> this
