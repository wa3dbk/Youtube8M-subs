00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
actually build a bit straight away
before<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:49.980> i<00:00:50.190> went<00:00:50.460> ahead<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.760> change

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
before but then i went ahead and change

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
before but then i went ahead and change
my<00:00:51.300> mind<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.809> rated<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.559> trees<00:00:52.890> and

my mind and I rated just some trees and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
my mind and I rated just some trees and

I think they let comp wrinkle and
especially<00:00:55.829> along<00:00:56.309> side<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> road<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.420> it
