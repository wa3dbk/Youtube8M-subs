that the throttle and the steering trims
down<00:02:27.700> here<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.300> looks<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.690> we've<00:02:28.780> also<00:02:28.870> got

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
down here and looks like we've also got

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.990 
down here and looks like we've also got
a<00:02:29.110> full<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.920> low<00:02:30.010> power<00:02:30.220> indicator<00:02:30.520> for<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
a full and low power indicator for the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.250 
a full and low power indicator for the
battery<00:02:31.300> strike<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.780> if<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.960> battery<00:02:32.170> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
battery strike so if the battery is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.200 
battery strike so if the battery is
running<00:02:32.380> down<00:02:32.650> that'll<00:02:33.610> tell<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.120> then

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
running down that'll tell you and then

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.820 
running down that'll tell you and then
you<00:02:34.330> know<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> change<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> batteries<00:02:35.200> that's

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you know to change the batteries that's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:45.540 
you know to change the batteries that's
good<00:02:41.130> instruction<00:02:42.130> manual<00:02:42.400> okay<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.280> we<00:02:45.430> need

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
good instruction manual okay so we need

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.890 
good instruction manual okay so we need
to<00:02:45.610> get<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.790> truck<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.150> actually<00:02:46.600> there<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
to get the truck out actually there is a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.680 
to get the truck out actually there is a
one<00:02:47.560> more<00:02:47.770> piece<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> charge

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
one more piece in here this is a charge

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.440 
one more piece in here this is a charge
adapter<00:02:50.340> you'll<00:02:51.340> need<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.760> because<00:02:52.030> there's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
adapter you'll need this because there's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.229 
adapter you'll need this because there's
a<00:02:52.510> Tamiya<00:02:53.440> plug<00:02:53.770> on<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.430> end<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.820> charger

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
a Tamiya plug on the end of the charger

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.060 
a Tamiya plug on the end of the charger
but<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.020> not<00:02:56.170> compatible<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
but this is not compatible with the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.270 
but this is not compatible with the
battery<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.510> need<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> adapter<00:02:59.170> plug<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
battery so you need the adapter plug the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
battery so you need the adapter plug the
adapter<00:03:00.370> onto<00:03:01.030> your<00:03:01.540> charger<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.290> then

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
adapter onto your charger so that then

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.290 
adapter onto your charger so that then
you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.590> charge<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.100> battery<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.270> sure

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
you can charge the battery so be sure

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.520 
you can charge the battery so be sure
that<00:03:04.420> you've<00:03:04.690> got<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.989> piece<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.410> there

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
that you've got this piece in there

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.330 
that you've got this piece in there
don't<00:03:06.070> throw<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> box<00:03:06.459> out

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.040 

and<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.430> truck<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:11.030> course<00:03:11.240> is<00:03:11.420> zip<00:03:11.599> tied<00:03:11.840> in

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
and the truck of course is zip tied in

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.729 
and the truck of course is zip tied in
here<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:12.890> we<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.310> see<00:03:14.239> what<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.420> buta<00:03:14.840> get

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
here so we have to see what the buta get

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.530 
here so we have to see what the buta get
the<00:03:15.860> zip<00:03:16.010> ties<00:03:16.190> cut<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.790> best<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.239> cut<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
the zip ties cut it's best to cut the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.630 
the zip ties cut it's best to cut the
zip<00:03:17.690> ties<00:03:17.930> from<00:03:18.200> underneath<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.459> you

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
zip ties from underneath so that you

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.580 
zip ties from underneath so that you
don't<00:03:19.819> risk<00:03:20.420> damaging<00:03:20.540> many<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.230> them<00:03:21.319> the
