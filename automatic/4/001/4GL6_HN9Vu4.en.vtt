00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.480
 in direct reaction when you defined the actor as being direct injection of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.489
 fuel first place 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.880
 means 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.919
 only if the 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.029
 that the fuel injector is inside the combustion chamber 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.150
 in the conventional engines of cindy actor to be naked in the intake manifold 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.170
 and then he must first pass through the corridor where he is never mingling 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.130
 with the sea 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.170
 passed the classes after he is arriving at the rabeta arriving in the chamber 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 combustion 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.840
 then any major 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 advantage that in this direct injection system 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.560
 like the beak 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.150
 the moment positioned inside the camera 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.060
 and it fuel arrives with one with a very high pressure 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 it will be trapped and taken into the combustion chamber 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.730
 so you mean 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.490
 when he makes the reservation however 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.970
 he took a look and started a lot of calories that has 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.080
 inside the camera 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.730
 so what is going to happen here you pay greatly reduced 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.240
 room temperature 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.250
 the camera temperature 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.320
 this was the main advantage 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.550
 here it is good to play the operating modes 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.370
 of direct injection 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.370
 function both in homogeneous combustion 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.270
 you can find some literature there 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.920
 talking like 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 stoichiometric combustion 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.870
 or with the fans the design and the stratified combustion 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.910
 We listen a lot, Ana. 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.180
 in direct management and we will know how this works from there 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.410
 So what is stratifying? 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.120
 if they are divided into overlapping layers or extracts 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.270
 it means inside the combustion chamber you have two layers 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.320
 many different 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.670
 of expenses we can put up 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.140
 It means you have the map. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.110
 around the beautiful one where you have a stoichiometric mix 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.509
 It's going to have combustion around here. 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.089
 you have a pure air smoking here kim ki-nam that will not burn 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.610
 but it will receive this heat from the flame that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.040
 that burned in the sea around the screen and will spread also take help to 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.319
 propagate
