fix<00:01:32.069> it<00:01:32.299> underneath<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.749> about<00:01:33.869> 9

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
fix it underneath this is about 9

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.349

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
day how big solar can be in Georgia we

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.830 
day how big solar can be in Georgia we
think<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.370> these<00:03:06.550> type<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.790> systems<00:03:07.330> can<00:03:07.750> be

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
think that these type of systems can be

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.110 
think that these type of systems can be
built<00:03:07.870> across<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> country<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.310> lot<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.030> those

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
built across the country a lot of those

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.760 
built across the country a lot of those
landfills<00:03:10.600> are<00:03:10.750> actually<00:03:11.080> built<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.500> an<00:03:11.590> urban

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770

landfills are actually built in an urban
setting<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.970> they're<00:03:13.180> close<00:03:13.540> to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
setting and so they're close to

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.199

going<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.480> keep<00:03:16.600> advancing<00:03:17.760> one<00:03:18.760> day<00:03:18.970> we'll

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
going to keep advancing one day we'll

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.850 
going to keep advancing one day we'll
