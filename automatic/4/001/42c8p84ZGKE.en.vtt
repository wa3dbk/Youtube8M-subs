this<00:00:37.440> from<00:00:37.739> Bioshock<00:00:38.070> hence<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> name

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this from Bioshock hence the name

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
this from Bioshock hence the name
something<00:00:38.940> shocking<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.629> yeah<00:00:40.530> nonetheless

though it's a rapture inspired map but
on<00:00:43.950> top<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> blue<00:00:45.270> like

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
different hiding spots you'll find

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
different hiding spots you'll find
really<00:01:40.290> cool-looking<00:01:40.680> technology<00:01:41.549> pieces

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
really cool-looking technology pieces

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
really cool-looking technology pieces
and<00:01:42.119> stuff<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.439> try<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and stuff like that so you can try to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.109 
and stuff like that so you can try to
hide<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.009> an<00:01:44.159> event<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> stay<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.030> your

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
hide out an event you can stay with your

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
hide out an event you can stay with your
teammates<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.659> chances<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.619> fog<00:01:46.890> will

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
teammates but chances are the fog will

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.130 
teammates but chances are the fog will
eventually<00:01:47.790> take<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.810> sounds

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
eventually take you and that just sounds

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
eventually take you and that just sounds
terrifying<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> say<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> what

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
terrifying to say but it's kind of what

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880 
terrifying to say but it's kind of what
happens<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> die<00:01:52.439> alone

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
happens and you don't want to die alone

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.179 
happens and you don't want to die alone
in<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.189> room<00:01:54.170> getting<00:01:55.170> eaten<00:01:55.470> by<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.770> bunch<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
in a room getting eaten by a bunch of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
in a room getting eaten by a bunch of
zombies<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> bunch<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> fog<00:01:57.090> around<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
zombies with a bunch of fog around you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.789 
zombies with a bunch of fog around you
it's<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.140> something<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> don't

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's just just not something you don't

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's just just not something you don't
want<00:01:58.950> something<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.460> don't<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
want something you don't want to do so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
want something you don't want to do so
what's<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> happen<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.619> though<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
what's going to happen here though is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
what's going to happen here though is
I'm<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> start<00:02:03.420> losing<00:02:03.930> my

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
I'm actually going to start losing my

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
I'm actually going to start losing my
teammates<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.979> purpose<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.549> thought<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
teammates not on purpose I thought that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.399 
teammates not on purpose I thought that
we<00:02:06.270> were<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.750> direction<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
we were all going one direction but you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.960 
we were all going one direction but you
can<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.710> since<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> drop<00:02:08.399> down<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.789> too

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can see since the drop down it was too

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.100 
can see since the drop down it was too
late<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
late and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.810 
late and
I'm<00:02:10.440> left<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.009> own<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.460> that's<00:02:11.610> exactly

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
I'm left on my own and that's exactly

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.400 
I'm left on my own and that's exactly
what<00:02:12.090> happens<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> me<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.510> die<00:02:12.570> alone<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.230> room

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
what happens to me I die alone in a room

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
what happens to me I die alone in a room
with<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> bunch<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> fog<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> floods<00:02:14.640> start

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
with a bunch of fog and the floods start

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.070 
with a bunch of fog and the floods start
coming<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> fog<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.900> just

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
coming out of the fog and it's just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.410 
coming out of the fog and it's just
terrifying<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.490> can't<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:18.180> see

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
terrifying because you can't really see

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.300 
terrifying because you can't really see
the<00:02:18.600> flood<00:02:18.870> until<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.500> too<00:02:19.770> late<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.130> that's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the flood until it's too late and that's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
the flood until it's too late and that's
just<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.240> terrifying<00:02:21.540> thought<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> think

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
just it's a terrifying thought to think

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.360 
just it's a terrifying thought to think
about<00:02:22.320> but<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.890> could<00:02:23.010> drop<00:02:23.190> down

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
about but you can see it could drop down

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
about but you can see it could drop down
here<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.350> immediately<00:02:25.350> I'm<00:02:25.590> alone<00:02:25.860> no<00:02:26.100> one

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
here and immediately I'm alone no one

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
here and immediately I'm alone no one
followed<00:02:26.550> me<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.880> start<00:02:27.210> trying<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.680> locate

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
followed me so I start trying to locate

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.110 
followed me so I start trying to locate
myself<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.430> myself<00:02:29.550> back<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.030> my

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
myself and get myself back to my

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
myself and get myself back to my
teammates<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.990> too<00:02:31.170> late<00:02:31.320> for<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
teammates but it's too late for that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
teammates but it's too late for that
once<00:02:31.860> you're<00:02:32.010> alone<00:02:32.280> you're<00:02:32.580> already<00:02:32.910> dead<00:02:33.240> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
once you're alone you're already dead so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.390 
once you're alone you're already dead so
I<00:02:33.840> start<00:02:34.110> trying<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.350> maneuver<00:02:34.830> through<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
I start trying to maneuver through the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.310 
I start trying to maneuver through the
different<00:02:36.000> pieces<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.450> map<00:02:36.720> taking<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> look<00:02:37.200> at

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
different pieces of map taking a look at

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.660 
different pieces of map taking a look at
all<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> different<00:02:37.590> technology<00:02:38.190> pieces<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
all the different technology pieces the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.880 
all the different technology pieces the
screens<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.240> whatnot<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:39.510> again<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.680> too

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
screens and whatnot but again it's too

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.890 
screens and whatnot but again it's too
late<00:02:41.070> for<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.180> alone<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
late for me because I'm alone and I'm a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.230 
late for me because I'm alone and I'm a
very<00:02:43.440> big<00:02:43.920> target<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.580> flood<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.060> it's

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
very big target for the flood so it's

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.490 
very big target for the flood so it's
only<00:02:45.360> gonna<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.660> couple<00:02:45.780> seconds<00:02:46.200> before<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
only gonna be a couple seconds before I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.870 
only gonna be a couple seconds before I
get<00:02:46.650> infected<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> try<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.430> barricade

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
get infected but I try to barricade

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.910 
get infected but I try to barricade
myself<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.690> inside<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.590> corner

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
myself up here inside of this corner

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
myself up here inside of this corner
here<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.340> know<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> get<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:50.850> kill<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
here but you know I get one kill and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690 
here but you know I get one kill and
then<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.320> get<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.860> think<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.400> one<00:02:53.550> or<00:02:53.670> two

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
then I get I think it like one or two

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
then I get I think it like one or two
more<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.420> too<00:02:54.600> late<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.020> me<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.860> go

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
more but it's too late for me and I go

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.290 
more but it's too late for me and I go
down<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> very<00:02:56.670> terrifying<00:02:57.000> map

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
down so it's a very terrifying map
