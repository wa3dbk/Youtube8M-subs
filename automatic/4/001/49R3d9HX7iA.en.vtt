00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
maybe Springs might be the next job the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.750 
maybe Springs might be the next job the
EMU<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.049> what<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:26.200> installing<00:02:27.360> are<00:02:28.360> the

EMU that just sports there's the box

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.550 
EMU that just sports there's the box
right<00:02:36.190> there<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:39.930> I'll<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.079> install<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
