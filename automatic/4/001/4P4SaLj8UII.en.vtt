00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.900
 and we start with our dearest 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.500
 green towel for Córdoba man there 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.970
 go back to 1969 for the last 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.060
 win first division agreement 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.730
 in the calderón 45 years ago his 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.170
 fans did not see a victory 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.630
 I insist on the first magnificent vision 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.490
 chosen scenario san mamés and if at 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.590
 córdoba we are teaching you yellow and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.629
 red because this man and his predecessor 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.030
 the chapi won no matches 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.980
 today the towel deserves this day 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.470
 green because they were also many ulta 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.530
 in his behavior it was fantastic because 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.870
 the green for the cordoba and the yellow 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.019
 the yellow one I'm going to give it in 1 in the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.510
 last 12 points I think it has only 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.760
 won 2 my question is we rush 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.440
 in its valuation at the beginning of the season 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.930
 September October where everyone 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.580
 I agreed that in a magnificent coach 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.440
 or we rush now with these 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.299
 four games with this streak where already 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.670
 is getting great reviews that I read 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.590
 yesterday on twitter in valencià that if you do not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.500
 well the matches that if you always put a 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.120
 the same good this is the situation 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.620
 one needs to react and its valence 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.800
 also to find the path of the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.800
 league 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 and the red for whom for the referee of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 I will give that match to 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.659
 hernandez hernandez I do not like the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.659
 arbitration for me interpreted so 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.700
 very severe the regulation is true that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.159
 rig and blue who had him before 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.020
 warned but they are fighting simply 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.970
 for the position and takes out two cards 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.770
 which account you are going to lose 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 next match this solves that a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.940
 red card for paco and another for a 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.950
 yellow for Juan Carlos, I think it's 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.210
 very severe I do not say that it is not that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 interpret the regulation but it is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.160
 exceedingly severe the punishment that in 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.259
 the two moves I think that the 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.789
 players in addition their assistants either 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.700
 they helped him because this goal of the Arab 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.619
 is in a correct situation and did not give it and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.300
 however , he did give this 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.580
 fixed plays in the same way then touches the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.350
 arabi and that what it does is that the one 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.759
 makes the goal to isaac is in out of 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.280
 game because the ball comes from the Arab 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.300
 therefore for me I did not like the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.950
 hernandez arbitration 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.989
 I insist I do not say that the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.910
 regulation in the two initial moves 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.500
 I mentioned but it was 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 all the options that the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 more severe application too punishment 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 for what little the players did 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600
 if not
