00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 that of the sacred mountain this day we 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.609
 not find for gilbert montagné 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 number a lot i'm more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.120
 exactly at last short so that's it 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 special it's a killer stryges id p o 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.300
 so we will try perron on eight 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.289
 original trichine belts I have nothing 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 with 10 but but but but but I 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.600
 managed to make enough runs 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.170
 nice shot low 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.850
 look at him ogier I've done enough already 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.700
 simple 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.740
 it represents at least 5 and the god of 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.990
 and of and at least 3 so I think 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.220
 I'm going to put them to sell because 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.330
 as much to make a profit 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.310
 so why make a belt 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.050
 stryges ipo so in fact it's 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.720
 all sainton belts we'll be taking 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 I have a pretty clear So here then there 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.220
 sorry there are lots of stuff here so we 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.809
 will hide stuff because it stays 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.800
 kivu who are not two chips then gdg 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.370
 full of orders 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.010
 besides, it is frankly 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.449
 I wanted to talk about something to stop 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.360
 to take orders in a vacuum 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.440
 people it's useless it's okay anymore you 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.600
 to piss off because you will have a 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.710
 wrong answer is everything there is a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.870
 who took me an order 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.770
 balala the pilot sister as you could 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.210
 see now the previous figure 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.500
 go up to deny and the guy did not take me 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.890
 and again he must even take a sail 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010
 ink 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.360
 imagine I would have done so I will have 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 but he blocked me from sailing really 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 hurry on skype what I had been seeing 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.810

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.930
 strydonk belt ceased 40 million in p 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 o so this is a person who 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.189
 had taken several orders that I 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.920

 I thank him for his help 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.829

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.829

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.190
 Besides, I thanked him for my 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.490
 these mini killer who created it or whatever 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.910
 but in any case it is he who 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.230
 gave me the envi do it so bah voila 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.750
 what finally here is 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.790
 then no it still works no no 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.790
 seriously we will watch if we draw up a 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.800
 bitter ok ok that's good I'm 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.090
 really sorry I will not put 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.540
 a lot of time just watch her 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 volvo on call you up said it screams then 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.900

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.820
 it's gone we cut the access channel 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.070
 are not going to see the bubble because otherwise 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.560
 you're going to see the bubble and 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.000
 so his car then hop tuto to 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.710
 lives so the streams are pretty simple 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.670
 damage of the times because it's more 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.000
 that it was a card game that was 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.020
 from 10 dom to ge oil bark I am 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.370
 someone very 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.910
 no in fact there is no connection with this 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.070
 personality 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.860
 finally short no but since he had 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:27.840
 compensated zealous is that I thought 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 also improve the exos en masse 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.140
 account put the sales but I count 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.810
 also maybe put bayard in a 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.310
 subscriber also jean macé who made me 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.040
 think maybe put the time 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.860
 exhilarating that I put to the efs and me 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:47.360
 the exo finally brief here it is gone to 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.360
 success pay 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.390
 yep small success first 1st 1st first 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.090
 success then it's at the end of the mud of 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.310
 the second attempt that would give a 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.950
 legend and yes runes two small 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.830
 alleys I make love to her I'll do my 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:17.430
 sorting basin I will go for a good there 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:20.530
 when I can not wait for pétanque and me as 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.700
 it's brief 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.170
 I do not know if I will continue I 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.520
 think I will continue the video and 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.250
 then I will put you others 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.800
 street belts maybe we will redo 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.410
 10 20 attempts in street belt 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.370
 perrache think like that we'll do that 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.870
 I think we'll do that because there 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.660
 I did that attempts but about 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.860
 I was told to do yes then not like 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.580
 that I can prepare videos being 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.290
 given that you want to hospitalize 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.790
 like that I prepare other videos to 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.960
 side like that it makes me small 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.940

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.830
