00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.820 

so<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.420> my<00:00:09.570> first<00:00:09.809> look<00:00:10.139> at<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.349> Nexus<00:00:10.620> 5

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so in my first look at the Nexus 5

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.890 
so in my first look at the Nexus 5
camera<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.550> wasn't<00:00:11.910> particularly<00:00:12.330> impressed

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
camera it wasn't particularly impressed

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.690 
camera it wasn't particularly impressed
but<00:00:13.380> I've<00:00:13.469> spent<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.769> bit<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:13.950> time<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
but I've spent a bit more time with it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.790 
but I've spent a bit more time with it
over<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.940> last<00:00:15.150> few<00:00:15.360> days<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.529> some

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
over the last few days and I have some

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.859 
over the last few days and I have some
observations<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
observations and I don't think it's the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.450 
observations and I don't think it's the
Nexus<00:00:19.230> 5's<00:00:19.590> cameras<00:00:20.039> fault

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Nexus 5's cameras fault

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
Nexus 5's cameras fault
I<00:00:20.520> actually<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.869> issues<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.260> was

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
I actually think all of the issues I was

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
I actually think all of the issues I was
having<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:23.490> down<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> rubbish

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
having really are down to the rubbish

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.150 
having really are down to the rubbish
app<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.250> shipped<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.730> Android<00:00:27.410> now<00:00:28.410> why

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
app that is shipped with Android now why

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
app that is shipped with Android now why
Google<00:00:29.760> didn't<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.269> any<00:00:30.449> major

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
Google didn't make any major

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
Google didn't make any major
improvements<00:00:31.439> ie<00:00:31.619> completely<00:00:32.160> overhauled

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
improvements ie completely overhauled

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.850 
improvements ie completely overhauled
the<00:00:32.880> Android<00:00:33.180> 4.4<00:00:33.450> camera<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> beyond<00:00:34.649> me

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the Android 4.4 camera is beyond me

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.090 
the Android 4.4 camera is beyond me
because<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> needs<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:37.590> problems<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
because it needs it so the problems that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.940 
because it needs it so the problems that
I<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.149> its<00:00:39.570> focus<00:00:40.140> lock<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.710> time

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
I have really are its focus lock on time

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
I have really are its focus lock on time
is<00:00:41.190> rubbish<00:00:41.640> most<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> time<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.540> doesn't

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is rubbish most of the time it doesn't

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
is rubbish most of the time it doesn't
actually<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.590> focus<00:00:43.890> part<00:00:44.550> that's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
actually get the right focus part that's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually get the right focus part that's
not<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.059> focus<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.570> looks<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> focus<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> me

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
not in focus it looks in focus to me

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.340 
not in focus it looks in focus to me
that's<00:00:47.250> still<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.239> focus<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.989> know

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that's still not really in focus I know

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.510 
that's still not really in focus I know
obviously<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> most<00:00:50.309> ideal

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
obviously this is not the most ideal

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270 
obviously this is not the most ideal
setup<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.360> demo<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.129> this<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
setup to the other demo this but this is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
setup to the other demo this but this is
really<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.699> I've<00:00:53.850> noticed<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> time

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
really what I've noticed time and time

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
really what I've noticed time and time
again<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.649> lock<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.460> properly<00:00:56.969> at

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
again it does not lock on properly at

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.860 
again it does not lock on properly at
all<00:00:57.480> its<00:00:57.930> focus<00:00:58.410> focus<00:00:59.280> hunting<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> rubbish

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
all its focus focus hunting is rubbish

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
all its focus focus hunting is rubbish
friendly<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.980> needs<00:01:02.309> vastly<00:01:03.090> better

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
friendly and it needs vastly better

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
friendly and it needs vastly better
detection<00:01:03.890> algorithms<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.189> currently

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
detection algorithms that it's currently

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.870 
detection algorithms that it's currently
got<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> low-light<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.380> testable<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
got in the low-light it's testable it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.719 
got in the low-light it's testable it's
okay<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.290> again<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
okay but again this is all down to the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.350 
okay but again this is all down to the
camera<00:01:12.299> app<00:01:12.479> itself<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> actual<00:01:13.830> camera

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
camera app itself not the actual camera

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
camera app itself not the actual camera
when<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.630> other<00:01:15.780> camera<00:01:16.140> apps<00:01:16.320> I've

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
when I use other camera apps I've

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.170 
when I use other camera apps I've
actually<00:01:17.189> found<00:01:17.490> things<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> improved

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
actually found things have improved

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
actually found things have improved
quite<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.689> lock-on<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> faster

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
quite a bit that lock-on is faster

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
quite a bit that lock-on is faster
everything<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.189> generally<00:01:20.549> better<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
everything is generally better and so it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
everything is generally better and so it
does<00:01:21.810> seem<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:22.920> impressed

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
does seem that if you're not impressed

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.830 
does seem that if you're not impressed
with<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> Nexus<00:01:24.030> 5<00:01:24.210> camera<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> first

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
with the Nexus 5 camera when you first

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
with the Nexus 5 camera when you first
get<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> app<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
get it it's the app that's really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
get it it's the app that's really
causing<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:27.060> problems<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.840> images<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.409> have

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
causing your problems the images do have

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
causing your problems the images do have
a<00:01:28.650> slight<00:01:28.979> softness<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.030> viewed<00:01:30.329> on

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a slight softness to them when viewed on

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
a slight softness to them when viewed on
the<00:01:30.750> Nexus<00:01:31.079> 5<00:01:31.110> screen<00:01:31.799> however<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:33.060> sent

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the Nexus 5 screen however when sent

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.440 
the Nexus 5 screen however when sent
across<00:01:33.810> looking<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.259> those<00:01:34.380> RAW<00:01:34.619> images<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:35.340> my

across looking at those RAW images on my

across looking at those RAW images on my
PC<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:37.229> softness<00:01:37.710> seems<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
PC that softness seems to have

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
PC that softness seems to have
disappeared<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.450> there<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.869> weird

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
disappeared so again is there some weird

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.450 
disappeared so again is there some weird
problem<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
problem going on there with the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920 
problem going on there with the
sharpening<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.360> applying<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
sharpening that they're applying in the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
sharpening that they're applying in the
gallery<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.619> too<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.880> there

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
gallery not too sure I do think there

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.490 
gallery not too sure I do think there
might<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.329> few<00:01:45.570> bugs<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.049> kinks<00:01:46.380> they're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
might be a few bugs and kinks they're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
might be a few bugs and kinks they're
still<00:01:46.680> trying<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> work<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
still trying to work out here now what a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
still trying to work out here now what a
thing<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> note<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.390> app<00:01:51.509> hasn't

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
thing to note is that the the app hasn't

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.649 
thing to note is that the the app hasn't
really<00:01:52.290> changed<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.829> much<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
really changed that much and so it's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
really changed that much and so it's
still<00:01:54.780> fairly<00:01:55.200> limited<00:01:55.439> they've<00:01:55.829> made<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> few

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
still fairly limited they've made a few

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
still fairly limited they've made a few
changes<00:01:56.430> within<00:01:57.240> photosphere<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
changes within photosphere to make it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
changes within photosphere to make it
better<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.130> detecting<00:01:59.399> seams<00:01:59.909> stitching

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
better at detecting seams stitching

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.230 
better at detecting seams stitching
everything<00:02:01.049> together<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
everything together and so on and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
everything together and so on and
obviously<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.360> still<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.140> settings<00:02:04.680> pop

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
obviously we still have the settings pop

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.969 
obviously we still have the settings pop
out<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.520> which<00:02:06.240> does<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.229> new<00:02:07.409> HDR

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
out here which does have this new HDR

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.180 
out here which does have this new HDR
mode<00:02:08.569> for<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.690> mind<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> HDR<00:02:10.619> plus<00:02:10.920> mode

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
mode for my mind this HDR plus mode

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.820 
mode for my mind this HDR plus mode
makes

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
makes

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.860 
makes
a<00:02:11.890> lot<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.130> Bali<00:02:12.400> difference<00:02:12.910> really<00:02:13.510> doesn't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a lot of Bali difference really doesn't

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
particularly good but again when you've

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.400 
particularly good but again when you've
got<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> camera<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.510> taking<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.020> long<00:02:26.050> to

got a camera that is taking so long to

got a camera that is taking so long to
lock-on<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.550> long<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.180> fire<00:02:28.390> every<00:02:28.720> frame

lock-on and so long to fire every frame
I'm<00:02:29.320> not<00:02:29.920> surprised<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.670> HDR<00:02:31.000> plus<00:02:31.270> isn't

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
I'm not surprised the HDR plus isn't

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
I'm not surprised the HDR plus isn't
working<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.020> well<00:02:32.670> realistically<00:02:33.670> we<00:02:33.760> need

working very well realistically we need

working very well realistically we need
to<00:02:34.000> fire<00:02:34.210> those<00:02:34.390> frames<00:02:34.660> quite<00:02:34.960> quickly

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
to fire those frames quite quickly

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.380 
to fire those frames quite quickly
whilst<00:02:36.070> adjusting<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> exposure<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.240> get

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
whilst adjusting the exposure to get

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.910 
whilst adjusting the exposure to get
great<00:02:37.600> HDR<00:02:38.050> because<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.350> don't<00:02:38.560> want<00:02:38.710> things

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
great HDR because we don't want things

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.040 
great HDR because we don't want things
moving<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.520> any<00:02:39.790> extra<00:02:40.240> camera<00:02:40.540> shake<00:02:40.570> getting

in<00:02:41.140> there<00:02:41.320> for<00:02:42.280> my<00:02:42.400> mind<00:02:42.700> Google<00:02:43.120> need<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.420> go

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
in there for my mind Google need to go

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.450 
in there for my mind Google need to go
back<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.020> try<00:02:44.170> again<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.710> camera<00:02:45.340> app

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
back and try again with the camera app

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.840 
back and try again with the camera app
it<00:02:45.670> simply<00:02:46.030> isn't<00:02:46.530> suitable<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.640> really

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
it simply isn't suitable and it really

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.449 
it simply isn't suitable and it really
is<00:02:49.060> substandard<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:49.959> opinion<00:02:50.320> now<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:51.010> hope

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
is substandard in my opinion now I hope

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.530 
is substandard in my opinion now I hope
trifocal<00:02:52.360> our<00:02:52.930> focal<00:02:53.530> app<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.790> unfortunately

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
trifocal our focal app but unfortunately

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.420 
trifocal our focal app but unfortunately
the<00:02:55.660> developer<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:56.410> needs<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.709> release

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
the developer I think needs to release

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.790 
the developer I think needs to release
an<00:02:57.550> update<00:02:57.880> because<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.900> not<00:02:59.200> working

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
an update because it's not working

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.030 
an update because it's not working
particularly<00:03:00.280> well<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:02.500> instance<00:03:02.620> can't

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
particularly well for instance can't

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.290 
particularly well for instance can't
really<00:03:03.340> interact<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> camera

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
really interact with the camera

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.090 
really interact with the camera
particularly<00:03:04.810> well<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.740> won't<00:03:05.920> actually

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
particularly well and it won't actually

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.090 
particularly well and it won't actually
take<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.730> app<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.170> probably<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.320> best<00:03:08.590> hope

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
take the app so probably the best hope

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.790 
take the app so probably the best hope
we<00:03:09.340> have<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> replacement<00:03:10.570> camera<00:03:11.380> on<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
we have for a replacement camera on the

Nexus<00:03:12.100> 5<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.700> be<00:03:12.760> focal<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.020> dev

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
Nexus 5 is going to be focal but the dev

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.360 
Nexus 5 is going to be focal but the dev
needs<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.530> little<00:03:14.650> bit<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.830> work<00:03:14.980> there<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.250> think

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
needs a little bit of work there I think

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.750 
needs a little bit of work there I think
to<00:03:15.700> make<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.090> compatible<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.750> nexus<00:03:17.110> 5

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
to make it compatible with a nexus 5

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.570 
to make it compatible with a nexus 5
overall<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.420> camera<00:03:19.930> really<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:21.190> great

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
overall the camera really is a great

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.180 
overall the camera really is a great
camera<00:03:22.000> when<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.959> camera<00:03:23.410> app<00:03:23.620> works

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
camera when the camera app works

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
properly when it locks on beautifully

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.440 
properly when it locks on beautifully
when<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:26.980> have<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> nice<00:03:27.400> steady<00:03:27.670> shot<00:03:27.820> the

be<00:03:55.630> brilliant<00:03:56.260> do<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.709> know<00:03:56.800> what<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.950> mean

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
be brilliant do you know what I mean

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.920 
be brilliant do you know what I mean
they<00:03:57.250> very<00:03:57.790> much<00:03:57.910> focus<00:03:58.300> on<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.720> base

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
they very much focus on the base

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.630 
they very much focus on the base
operating<00:03:59.170> system<00:03:59.860> and<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.370> other<00:04:00.489> things

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
operating system and the other things

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.490 
operating system and the other things
like<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.850> camera<00:04:01.180> are<00:04:01.390> almost<00:04:01.690> an<00:04:02.110> optional

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
like the camera are almost an optional

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.160 
like the camera are almost an optional
extra<00:04:02.920> if<00:04:03.580> they<00:04:03.790> didn't<00:04:04.269> have<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.450> ship<00:04:05.019> one

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
extra if they didn't have to ship one

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.560 
extra if they didn't have to ship one
they<00:04:05.350> probably<00:04:05.530> wouldn't<00:04:06.040> kind<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.489> thing<00:04:06.640> and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
they probably wouldn't kind of thing and

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.180 
they probably wouldn't kind of thing and
so<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:07.870> feels<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.739> case<00:04:08.950> of

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
so it just feels like it's a case of

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.789 
so it just feels like it's a case of
well<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.760> camera<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.420> there<00:04:10.690> like<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.650> or

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
well the camera is there like it or

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.310 
well the camera is there like it or
don't<00:04:12.580> use<00:04:13.060> something<00:04:13.269> else<00:04:13.480> instead<00:04:13.810> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
don't use something else instead and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.530 
don't use something else instead and
fair<00:04:14.980> enough<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.549> know<00:04:15.670> there<00:04:16.030> are<00:04:16.150> plenty<00:04:16.390> of

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
fair enough you know there are plenty of

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.300 
fair enough you know there are plenty of
better<00:04:16.780> camera<00:04:17.169> apps<00:04:17.350> out<00:04:17.500> there<00:04:17.530> focal<00:04:18.130> is

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
better camera apps out there focal is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.710 
better camera apps out there focal is
definitely<00:04:18.760> one<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.060> best<00:04:19.239> camera<00:04:19.570> apps

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
definitely one of the best camera apps

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.050 
definitely one of the best camera apps
out<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.609> just<00:04:21.669> would<00:04:21.910> have<00:04:21.940> been

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
out there but it just would have been

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.790 
out there but it just would have been
nice<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.479> Google<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.930> spend<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.200> little<00:04:23.470> bit<00:04:23.680> of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
nice if Google to spend a little bit of

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.230 
nice if Google to spend a little bit of
time

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
time

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.540 
time
really<00:04:24.720> really<00:04:25.259> improving<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.130> camera

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
really really improving the camera

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.550 
really really improving the camera
especially<00:04:27.210> when<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:27.900> matched<00:04:28.169> up<00:04:28.380> with

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
especially when it's matched up with

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.559 
especially when it's matched up with
great<00:04:28.770> camera<00:04:29.160> hardware<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.849> just<00:04:30.150> feels<00:04:30.389> like

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
great camera hardware it just feels like

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.360 
great camera hardware it just feels like
people<00:04:30.780> will<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.139> poor<00:04:31.470> experience<00:04:32.069> and<00:04:32.250> it's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
people will get poor experience and it's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.909 
people will get poor experience and it's
not<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.759> hardware's<00:04:33.240> fault

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
not the hardware's fault

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.990 
not the hardware's fault
let's<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:35.069> talk<00:04:35.220> very<00:04:35.250> quickly<00:04:35.610> about<00:04:35.789> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
let's just talk very quickly about the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.999 
let's just talk very quickly about the
video<00:04:36.240> camera<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.840> shoots<00:04:37.199> at<00:04:37.349> 1080p

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
video camera it shoots at 1080p

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.939 
video camera it shoots at 1080p
it's<00:04:38.490> absolutely<00:04:39.060> passable<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.050> quality<00:04:40.860> in

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
it's absolutely passable the quality in

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.339 
it's absolutely passable the quality in
my<00:04:41.099> opinion<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.729> low-light<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.539> absolutely

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
my opinion in low-light is absolutely

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.350 
my opinion in low-light is absolutely
excellent<00:04:43.830> for<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.190> video<00:04:44.400> camera<00:04:44.699> very<00:04:45.120> low

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
excellent for a video camera very low

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.230 
excellent for a video camera very low
noise<00:04:45.599> very<00:04:46.380> good<00:04:46.650> ISO<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.310> very<00:04:48.000> good

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
noise very good ISO and very good

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.450 
noise very good ISO and very good
exposure<00:04:48.599> and<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.470> does<00:04:49.680> everything<00:04:49.949> for<00:04:50.310> you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
exposure and it does everything for you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.830 
exposure and it does everything for you
you've<00:04:50.610> got<00:04:50.729> low<00:04:50.849> focusing<00:04:51.360> or<00:04:51.419> anything<00:04:51.599> like

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
you've got low focusing or anything like

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.969 
you've got low focusing or anything like
that<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.110> even<00:04:52.259> tapping<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.680> screen<00:04:52.860> to

that and even tapping the screen to

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.370 
that and even tapping the screen to
focus<00:04:53.280> does<00:04:53.550> nothing<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.900> are<00:04:55.080> very<00:04:55.110> much

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
focus does nothing so you are very much

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.969 
focus does nothing so you are very much
reliant<00:04:55.979> on<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.659> autofocus<00:04:57.889> algorithm<00:04:58.889> the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
not brilliant it does occasionally

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.770 
not brilliant it does occasionally
wobble<00:05:04.830> off<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.520> focus<00:05:05.940> on<00:05:06.030> things<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.449> feel

wobble off and focus on things that feel

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.420 
wobble off and focus on things that feel
should<00:05:07.289> be<00:05:07.349> in<00:05:07.590> focus<00:05:07.979> when<00:05:08.099> they<00:05:08.220> shouldn't

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.749 
be
but<00:05:09.569> overall<00:05:10.050> it's<00:05:10.620> okay<00:05:11.069> it<00:05:11.340> does<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.610> great

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
but overall it's okay it does a great

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.430 
but overall it's okay it does a great
job<00:05:11.849> more<00:05:12.300> importantly<00:05:12.690> though<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:12.990> actual

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
job more importantly though the actual

job more importantly though the actual
output<00:05:13.919> video<00:05:14.190> images<00:05:14.789> are<00:05:15.030> excellent<00:05:15.569> and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
output video images are excellent and

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.899
