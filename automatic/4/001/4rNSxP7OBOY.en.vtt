a cpu installation guide and i will
again<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> camera<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.990> closer<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.650> put

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
again get the camera in closer and put

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.439 
again get the camera in closer and put
this<00:00:17.490> thing<00:00:17.789> down<00:00:18.650> horizontally<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.240> can

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
this thing down horizontally so we can

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.179 
this thing down horizontally so we can
have<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.930> good<00:00:22.170> time<00:00:22.230> installing<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.660> intel<00:00:24.660> i7

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
have a good time installing the intel i7

actually<00:00:34.770> even<00:00:35.130> seen<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> sandy<00:00:36.180> bridge<00:00:36.420> cpu

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actually even seen a sandy bridge cpu

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.729 
actually even seen a sandy bridge cpu
before<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.309> excited<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.739> here

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
before so I'm pretty excited and here

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
before so I'm pretty excited and here
it's<00:00:41.010> still<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> plastic<00:00:44.239> fitting<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's still in the plastic fitting and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
it's still in the plastic fitting and
I'll<00:00:45.960> keep<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.649> until<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> all

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
I'll keep it there until I get this all

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.319 
I'll keep it there until I get this all
so<00:00:48.960> let's<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.329> CPU

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so let's get on with the CPU

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.580 
so let's get on with the CPU
installation<00:00:53.120> first<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.110> if

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
installation first of all but if if

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
installation first of all but if if
you're<00:00:55.920> using<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.399> aftermarket<00:00:56.850> cooler

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you're using an aftermarket cooler

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750 
you're using an aftermarket cooler
you're<00:00:58.199> most<00:00:58.410> likely<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> back

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you're most likely going to have a back

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.630 
you're most likely going to have a back
plate<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.300> already<00:01:00.719> had<00:01:00.989> mine<00:01:01.320> installed<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
plate I already had mine installed and I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
plate I already had mine installed and I
had<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.059> sticks<00:01:03.449> coming<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> back

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
had these sticks coming up from the back

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300 
had these sticks coming up from the back
plate<00:01:05.900> for<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.080> water<00:01:07.320> cooling<00:01:07.740> system<00:01:08.130> which

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
plate for my water cooling system which

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830 
plate for my water cooling system which
I'm<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> install<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I'm going to install and you're going to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
I'm going to install and you're going to
have<00:01:09.960> something<00:01:10.380> similar<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.119> when<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have something similar to that when you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
have something similar to that when you
have<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.159> regular<00:01:14.369> fan<00:01:14.939> cpu<00:01:15.810> heatsink

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
have a just a regular fan cpu heatsink

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
have a just a regular fan cpu heatsink
cooler<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.299> here<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> standard<00:01:19.610> Intel

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
cooler and here is the standard Intel

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.080 
cooler and here is the standard Intel
cooler<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.720> comes<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.850> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
cooler that comes with the that that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
cooler that comes with the that that
comes<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> CPU<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:30.229> we're<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
comes with the CPU so we're not going to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.840 
comes with the CPU so we're not going to
use<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
use this and here at first we have to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.710 
use this and here at first we have to
remove<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.170> black<00:01:37.619> plastic<00:01:38.369> part<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
remove this black plastic part the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.030 
remove this black plastic part the
plastic<00:01:40.259> safe<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.740> by<00:01:43.799> pressing

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
plastic safe and you do that by pressing

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.260 
plastic safe and you do that by pressing
down<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.329> blue<00:01:45.990> lever<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> pull<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
down on this blue lever and then pull it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.149 
down on this blue lever and then pull it
up<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:49.170> metal<00:01:49.799> thing<00:01:49.829> comes<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
up this metal thing comes right up and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
up this metal thing comes right up and
then<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.189> take<00:01:56.149> let's<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:57.509> power<00:01:59.479> yeah<00:02:00.479> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
then you take let's see power yeah it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.940 
then you take let's see power yeah it
just<00:02:00.840> comes<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.950> there

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just comes right up right up and there

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.690 
just comes right up right up and there
you<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.579> put<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> away<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.099> then<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.489> have

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you just put it away and then you have

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
you just put it away and then you have
your<00:02:08.729> CPU<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.899> actual<00:02:10.440> cpu<00:02:11.989> whether<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the Intel doesn't matter as long as you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460 
the Intel doesn't matter as long as you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
have the right socket you need to make

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
have the right socket you need to make
sure<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.920> your<00:02:20.130> motherboard<00:02:20.730> has<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.180> right

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
sure that your motherboard has the right

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.670 
sure that your motherboard has the right
socket<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:23.370> cpu<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:25.580> let's<00:02:26.580> see<00:02:27.410> how<00:02:28.410> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
socket for that cpu and let's see how is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.960 
socket for that cpu and let's see how is
this<00:02:28.950> opened<00:02:30.350> there<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.640> careful

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
this opened there and be very careful

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.560 
this opened there and be very careful
not<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.540> drop<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.020> or<00:02:34.380> anything<00:02:34.710> else<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
not to drop this or anything else and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.590 
not to drop this or anything else and
grab<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.600> only<00:02:37.080> by<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.290> edges<00:02:37.770> don't<00:02:38.600> don't

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
grab it only by the edges don't don't

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.240 
grab it only by the edges don't don't
let<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.820> fingers<00:02:41.820> cuts<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> copper<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.250> now

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
let your fingers cuts the copper and now

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.920 
let your fingers cuts the copper and now
we<00:02:44.310> need<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.760> make<00:02:45.000> sure<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.480> lined<00:02:45.750> up

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
we need to make sure it's lined up

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.190 
we need to make sure it's lined up
correctly<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.820> these<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:48.360> small

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
correctly we have these two small

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.000 
correctly we have these two small
plastic<00:02:49.560> things<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.270> edges<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.010> we

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
plastic things here on the edges and we

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.940 
plastic things here on the edges and we
have<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.700> indents<00:02:54.080> over<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.500> both

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
have little indents over here on both

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.120 
have little indents over here on both
sides<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.270> means<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:58.020> need<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.470> line<00:02:58.860> up

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
sides so that means we need the line up

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.340 
sides so that means we need the line up
this<00:02:59.610> way<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:02.580> way<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.320> see

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
this way this way and as you can see

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.550 
this way this way and as you can see
that<00:03:04.770> thing<00:03:05.400> over<00:03:05.610> there<00:03:05.900> will<00:03:06.900> line<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.170> with

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that thing over there will line up with

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.490 
that thing over there will line up with
the<00:03:08.300> actual<00:03:09.300> CPU<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.930> you're<00:03:12.930> not<00:03:13.110> supposed

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the actual CPU and you're not supposed

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
the actual CPU and you're not supposed
to<00:03:13.590> do<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.740> you're<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.880> supposed<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.300> lower

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
to do that you're just supposed to lower

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.550 
to do that you're just supposed to lower
down<00:03:16.020> but<00:03:16.530> touching<00:03:17.190> dirt<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:19.140> now<00:03:19.380> it's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
down but touching dirt and now it's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.090 
down but touching dirt and now it's
lowered<00:03:20.010> down<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.110> seems<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.410> there<00:03:22.650> you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
lowered down and seems to be there you

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.670 
lowered down and seems to be there you
don't<00:03:23.280> apply<00:03:23.580> any<00:03:23.880> pressure<00:03:24.090> do<00:03:25.020> not<00:03:25.290> apply

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
don't apply any pressure do not apply

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.060 
don't apply any pressure do not apply
pressure<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:26.400> let<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.880> fall<00:03:27.120> down<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.070> once

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
pressure just let it fall down and once

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.550 
pressure just let it fall down and once
it's<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.460> place<00:03:29.550> properly<00:03:30.510> make<00:03:31.050> sure<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.440> in

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
it's in place properly make sure it's in

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's in place properly make sure it's in
place<00:03:31.950> well<00:03:32.340> then<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:33.150> will<00:03:33.300> add<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.780> thing

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
place well then you will add this thing

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.340 
place well then you will add this thing
once<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.580> close<00:03:35.910> down<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.360> liver<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:37.080> will

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
once you close down the liver that will

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.610 
once you close down the liver that will
give<00:03:37.710> all<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.870> will<00:03:43.080> give<00:03:43.290> all<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
give all the that will give all the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.810 
give all the that will give all the
pressure<00:03:43.890> needs<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:45.000> stay<00:03:45.240> on<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.130> that's<00:03:47.130> how

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
pressure needs to stay on and that's how

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.930 
pressure needs to stay on and that's how
you<00:03:47.880> properly<00:03:48.300> install<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> CPU<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:50.700> just

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
you properly install a CPU now we just

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.570 
you properly install a CPU now we just
need<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.420> add<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.690> thermal<00:03:52.410> paste<00:03:52.710> before<00:03:53.340> we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
need to add the thermal paste before we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.710 
need to add the thermal paste before we
can<00:03:54.080> add<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.800> cooler<00:03:56.280> which<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.300> water

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
can add the cooler which is a water

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.050 
can add the cooler which is a water
cooling<00:03:58.200> block<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:59.160> i'm<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.460> going<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.820> show

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
cooling block but i'm not going to show

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.300 
cooling block but i'm not going to show
that<00:04:00.240> in<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.690> video<00:04:01.020> because<00:04:01.380> i<00:04:01.590> will<00:04:02.130> be

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that in this video because i will be

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.670 
that in this video because i will be
showing<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.850> my<00:04:03.180> water<00:04:03.540> cooling<00:04:03.990> tutorial

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
showing it in my water cooling tutorial

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.410 
showing it in my water cooling tutorial
episode<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.650> stay<00:04:07.980> tuned<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.580> we<00:04:09.060> will<00:04:09.090> be

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
episode so stay tuned and we will be

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.390 
episode so stay tuned and we will be
installing<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.260> ddr3<00:04:11.040> memory<00:04:11.760> next
