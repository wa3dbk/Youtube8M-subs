corkscrews and a bat way I'll point out

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:38.910 
corkscrews and a bat way I'll point out
the<00:00:16.419> batwing<00:00:16.750> later

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.240 

vortex<00:00:39.850> was<00:00:40.089> also<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.899> first<00:00:41.199> roller<00:00:41.649> coaster

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:58.820 

you

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.110 

remember<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.980> batwing<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.700> mentioned

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
remember that batwing I mentioned

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.570 
remember that batwing I mentioned
earlier<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:02.380> here<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.800> comes<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.400> going

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
earlier well here it comes and I'm going

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.840 
earlier well here it comes and I'm going
to<00:02:03.610> break<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.150> down<00:02:04.330> for<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.780> step<00:02:05.110> by<00:02:05.350> step

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to break it down for you step by step

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.139 
to break it down for you step by step
it's<00:02:06.850> sort<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.540> loop<00:02:08.050> corkscrew<00:02:09.009> hybrid<00:02:09.610> it

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
it's sort of a loop corkscrew hybrid it

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.820 
it's sort of a loop corkscrew hybrid it
starts<00:02:11.050> out<00:02:11.310> first<00:02:12.310> half<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.910> corkscrew

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
starts out first half of a corkscrew

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.470 
starts out first half of a corkscrew
calls<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.130> by<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> leaf<00:02:15.610> downward<00:02:16.920> upward<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
calls it by a leaf downward upward the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:31.720 
calls it by a leaf downward upward the
rest<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.050> corkscrew<00:02:20.620> out

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.880 

now<00:02:32.180> we've<00:02:32.420> been<00:02:32.629> sitting<00:02:32.930> down<00:02:33.260> for<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.680> while

now we've been sitting down for a while

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.259 
now we've been sitting down for a while
so<00:02:34.879> let's<00:02:35.120> take<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> break<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.900> stand<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:36.530> on

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
so let's take a break and stand up on
