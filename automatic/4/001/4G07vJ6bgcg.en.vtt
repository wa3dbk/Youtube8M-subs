for that is this merely for protection
it's<00:00:34.559> fairly<00:00:34.920> thin<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
it's fairly thin but you can see I'm a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
it's fairly thin but you can see I'm a
big<00:00:36.149> fan<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
big fan of these right here as it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
big fan of these right here as it
protects<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.340> corners<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> device<00:00:39.239> which

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
protects the corners of the device which

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
protects the corners of the device which
are<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.320> delicate<00:00:40.590> overall<00:00:41.520> though<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
are very delicate overall though it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.580 
are very delicate overall though it
doesn't<00:00:41.969> add<00:00:42.180> much<00:00:42.210> weight<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.410> see

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
doesn't add much weight but you can see

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.660 
doesn't add much weight but you can see
to<00:00:44.250> add<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.260> 1520<00:00:46.260> C<00:00:47.039> powered<00:00:47.520> in

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to add it to the 1520 C powered in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
to add it to the 1520 C powered in
powered<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.020> pop<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.379> in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
powered off there will just pop it in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.279 
powered off there will just pop it in
and<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:51.780> basically

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and there you go and that's basically

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
and there you go and that's basically
about<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
about it you can see that it's got a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
about it you can see that it's got a
nice<00:00:55.079> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.410> felt<00:00:55.680> material<00:00:55.829> feel<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
nice kind of felt material feel to it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
nice kind of felt material feel to it
and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> hard<00:00:58.559> plastic<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and then it's a hard plastic there it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920 
and then it's a hard plastic there it
doesn't<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.120> anything<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.420> camera

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
doesn't do anything for camera

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.090 
doesn't do anything for camera
protection<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.710> looking<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
protection so if you're looking for a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
protection so if you're looking for a
hump<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.489> anything<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.969> expect<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
hump or anything don't expect that you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
hump or anything don't expect that you
still<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.470> cutouts<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> flash<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
still got your cutouts for the flash and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 
still got your cutouts for the flash and
microphones<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.280> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
microphones as you can see there it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.560 
microphones as you can see there it
actually<00:01:08.729> makes<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> device<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.390> bit

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
actually makes a device a little bit

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
actually makes a device a little bit
more<00:01:09.720> crippled<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.619> opinion<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.670> easy

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
more crippled in my opinion so it's easy

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
more crippled in my opinion so it's easy
to<00:01:12.000> handle<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> hold<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> phone

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to handle and you can hold the phone

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
to handle and you can hold the phone
like<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.770> roll<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.970> works

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
like this and roll it over and it works

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730 
like this and roll it over and it works
okay<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> phone<00:01:15.990> believe<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.560> when

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
okay as a phone believe it or not when

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.960 
okay as a phone believe it or not when
you<00:01:16.830> hold<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.369> against<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.729> head<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you hold it up against your head it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
you hold it up against your head it
doesn't<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.299> feel<00:01:18.600> any<00:01:18.840> different<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
doesn't really feel any different of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
doesn't really feel any different of
course<00:01:19.830> you've<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> flip<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.780> over<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
course you've got to flip this over so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080 
course you've got to flip this over so
it<00:01:22.380> adds<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.740> extra<00:01:22.979> step<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.640> does<00:01:23.880> not

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
it adds an extra step this does not

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
it adds an extra step this does not
stick<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> phone<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> any<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.860> far<00:01:26.310> as

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
stick to the phone in any way so far as

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
stick to the phone in any way so far as
to<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.390> flop<00:01:27.750> open

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to kind of do that or just flop open

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
to kind of do that or just flop open
some<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.890> gonna<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
some are gonna like that it would be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
some are gonna like that it would be
nice<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.140> somehow<00:01:31.320> magnetic<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
nice if this was somehow magnetic and it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920 
nice if this was somehow magnetic and it
could<00:01:32.430> close<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.420> were<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.659> sort<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
could close or there were some sort of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.830 
could close or there were some sort of
latch<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.829> Nokia<00:01:35.460> decide<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> now

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
latch there but Nokia decide not to now

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
latch there but Nokia decide not to now
this<00:01:37.020> does<00:01:37.259> roll<00:01:37.530> around<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> whole
