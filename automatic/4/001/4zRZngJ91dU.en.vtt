 hi let's practice the movements for 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.190
 worthy the first the first verse goes like this 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.930
 the words are beautiful so 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.730
 we try to listen to it with our 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.300
 hearts there has never been another love so 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 big 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 let's make these movements the sign 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.850
 it is something a knot for love that is to cross 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.370
 our arms like this 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.620
 then let's do the sign again 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.060
 for big 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.220
 What is he doing? What is he doing? 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.640
 a fist and lifting these fingers as in 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.430
 hooks 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.520
 and so big 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.420
 it goes like this there's never been another love so 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 big after the song is still never has 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:53.230
 there was a heart so forgiving sign 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.240
 let's draw a heart in front of 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.980
 us with our middle fingers 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.360
 and that it looks like a heart because I 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.160
 Sometimes I have difficulty with that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.220
 look like a heart but I start from 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.120
 here not down drawing a heart 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 then let's do the greeting sign 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.420
 for forgiveness that is nothing more by dragging 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.090
 the palms as well as what are you cleaning 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 then see it would have never been a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 so forgiving heart 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.950
 follow the song with there has never been 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.200

 and do so 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.920
 this is the sign for people to be 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920
 saved 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.880
