00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 Good talking guys taking another video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.220
 here pro channel fake toys today with life 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 A little different 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.259
 I'm not doing any and saw 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.310
 no boxing or just showing some 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.900
 details about the album of the cup 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.529
 The truth is that I want to show the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.240
 next everybody already knows the album 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.340
 of the cup he has two mentions the version 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.610
 this version is simpler here 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 I arrived from soft cover to good traditional 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 and also has that hardcover album 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 huh 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.840
 would be a bit more expensive and with material 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 little better 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.370
 except that we have two 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.899
 types of algae and you find three 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 three types of sales options 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 but as well let's not go there for the first time 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.850
 purchase option would be this 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:18.860
 traditional album on the bench would be the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 option plus in account also the hardcover 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:37.049
 already would be and already comes packaged in an envelope 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 that accompanies the product is a bit more 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:46.140
 expensive suffers from the material a bit 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.850
 better and besides these two also have 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.579
 this guy here 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.140
 is a version that comes in a box is the 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.580
 hardcover album 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.090
 only comes a fee and comes with more 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.200
 envelopes 39 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.110
 so it's basically three types with 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.209
 these options I know three types 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.599
 of purchase options 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.780
 the album with the famous hard cover and the album 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.610
 hard cover in this box here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.750
 including this guy that I'm going to be 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.459
 making an indy box in the next video 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.380
 they even opened a little package 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.480
 to see 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.150
 so I just wanted to show you that same thing 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.060
 that there are two types of algae 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.140
 only that there are basically three three 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.630
 Buy options you can buy the cover 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:48.500
 soft sole hardcover with five 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:51.110
 envelopes and the hard cover with 39 is a 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.600
 very short video only to show these 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.160
 you have to buy the album from 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.840
 Cup 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.940
 and there it is again before closing here 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.450
 asking for personal strength, right? 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.220
