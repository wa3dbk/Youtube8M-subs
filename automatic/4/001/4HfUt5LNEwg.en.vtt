in the description below that like
button<00:00:17.689> basically<00:00:18.590> what<00:00:18.680> it<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.220> modular

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
button basically what it is is a modular

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.519 
button basically what it is is a modular
smartphone<00:00:20.180> where<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:20.630> can<00:00:20.720> take<00:00:20.960> components

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
smartphone where you can take components

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.170 
smartphone where you can take components
in<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:21.950> out<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.460> pinion<00:00:22.759> whether<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.000> want

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
in and out the pinion whether you want

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.030 
in and out the pinion whether you want
to<00:00:23.270> upgrade<00:00:23.390> them<00:00:23.869> where<00:00:24.259> they're<00:00:24.470> broken<00:00:24.739> to

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
to upgrade them where they're broken to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.710 
to upgrade them where they're broken to
say<00:00:25.309> your<00:00:25.460> screens<00:00:25.759> broken<00:00:26.059> you<00:00:26.300> just<00:00:26.360> take

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
say your screens broken you just take

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.630 
say your screens broken you just take
that<00:00:26.750> screen<00:00:27.230> off<00:00:27.410> put<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.829> brand<00:00:28.099> new<00:00:28.250> screen

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
that screen off put a brand new screen

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.519 
that screen off put a brand new screen
on<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:28.910> could<00:00:29.239> be<00:00:29.329> an<00:00:29.390> upgraded<00:00:30.050> one<00:00:30.290> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
on it could be an upgraded one and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.080 
on it could be an upgraded one and
that's<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.219> you<00:00:31.340> don't<00:00:31.520> have<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.700> throw<00:00:31.939> away

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
that's it you don't have to throw away

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.090 
that's it you don't have to throw away
your<00:00:32.119> whole<00:00:32.270> phone<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.440> change<00:00:33.710> your

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
your whole phone just to change your

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.740 
your whole phone just to change your

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
screen so it's an awesome awesome

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.360 
screen so it's an awesome awesome
concept<00:00:36.350> but<00:00:36.620> I'm<00:00:36.710> going<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.890> talk<00:00:37.040> about<00:00:37.190> the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
concept but I'm going to talk about the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.030 
concept but I'm going to talk about the
challenges<00:00:37.879> facing<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.620> first<00:00:39.860> one<00:00:39.980> is

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
challenges facing it so the first one is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.730 
challenges facing it so the first one is
keeping<00:00:40.700> V<00:00:40.850> prices<00:00:41.330> down<00:00:41.630> and<00:00:41.960> that's<00:00:42.290> all<00:00:42.620> in

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
keeping V prices down and that's all in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.500 
keeping V prices down and that's all in
the<00:00:42.860> manufacturing<00:00:43.580> you<00:00:44.060> see<00:00:44.210> at<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.360> moment

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
the manufacturing you see at the moment

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.970 
the manufacturing you see at the moment
for<00:00:44.900> traditional<00:00:45.290> smartphones<00:00:45.800> and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
for traditional smartphones and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.170 
for traditional smartphones and
manufacture<00:00:46.550> we'll<00:00:46.640> just<00:00:46.880> have<00:00:47.030> to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
manufacture we'll just have to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.810 
manufacture we'll just have to
manufacture<00:00:48.140> like<00:00:48.560> one<00:00:48.860> component<00:00:49.310> but

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
manufacture like one component but

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.040 
manufacture like one component but
produce<00:00:50.060> millions<00:00:50.540> and<00:00:50.780> millions<00:00:50.810> and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
produce millions and millions and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.780 
produce millions and millions and
millions<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.440> them<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:51.980> all<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
millions of them it's all going for the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.000 
millions of them it's all going for the
same<00:00:52.880> size<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.630> this<00:00:53.840> same<00:00:54.079> phone<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:54.770> with

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
same size in this same phone but with

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.500 
same size in this same phone but with
foam<00:00:55.250> blocks<00:00:55.520> there's<00:00:55.880> so<00:00:56.120> many<00:00:56.239> different

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
foam blocks there's so many different

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.870 
foam blocks there's so many different
variations<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.530> each<00:00:57.829> kind<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.250> components

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
variations of each kind of components

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.030 
variations of each kind of components
depending<00:00:59.270> on<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> specifications<00:01:00.590> of<00:01:00.739> each

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
depending on the specifications of each

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.220 
depending on the specifications of each
component<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.910> on<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.239> size<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:02.989> well

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
component and on the size of it as well

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.010 
component and on the size of it as well
the<00:01:03.710> batteries<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:04.369> capacity<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.210> size<00:01:05.479> was

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the batteries that capacity the size was

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.929 
the batteries that capacity the size was
obviously<00:01:06.409> screens<00:01:06.799> as<00:01:06.979> well<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.399> size<00:01:07.670> of

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
obviously screens as well the size of

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.670 
obviously screens as well the size of
them<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.479> quality<00:01:08.720> when<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.380> want<00:01:09.500> Oh

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
them and the quality when you want Oh

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.730 
them and the quality when you want Oh
LED<00:01:09.920> LCD<00:01:10.490> etc<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:11.869> there's<00:01:12.049> going<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.259> be<00:01:12.289> so

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
LED LCD etc so there's going to be so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.050 
LED LCD etc so there's going to be so
many<00:01:12.859> different<00:01:13.189> variations<00:01:13.549> on<00:01:13.939> the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
many different variations on the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.580 
many different variations on the
components<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.319> going<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.499> be<00:01:15.560> very

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
components so it's going to be very

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.559 
components so it's going to be very
tricky<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.219> keep<00:01:16.369> this<00:01:16.490> manufacturing<00:01:17.240> costs

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
tricky to keep this manufacturing costs

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.109 
tricky to keep this manufacturing costs
down<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.740> course<00:01:18.770> bone<00:01:19.549> blocks<00:01:19.819> have<00:01:19.969> now

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
down but of course bone blocks have now

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.209 
down but of course bone blocks have now
teed<00:01:20.389> up<00:01:20.539> with<00:01:20.780> Motorola<00:01:21.409> they've<00:01:21.889> been<00:01:22.039> in

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
teed up with Motorola they've been in

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.340 
teed up with Motorola they've been in
the<00:01:22.369> phone<00:01:22.609> busy<00:01:22.909> for<00:01:23.209> years<00:01:23.569> now<00:01:23.869> they're

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the phone busy for years now they're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.629 
the phone busy for years now they're
gonna<00:01:24.439> have<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:24.829> many<00:01:24.950> supplies

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
gonna have so many supplies

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.999 
gonna have so many supplies
manufacturers<00:01:26.209> etc<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.350> there's<00:01:27.560> anyone<00:01:27.950> to

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
manufacturers etc so there's anyone to

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.160 
manufacturers etc so there's anyone to
sort<00:01:28.399> out<00:01:28.639> this<00:01:28.819> boredom<00:01:29.240> Motorola<00:01:29.899> is

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170
