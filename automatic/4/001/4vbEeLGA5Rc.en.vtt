00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.130
 time in some videos there I came talking 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.590
 I would be to start a new 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 series in sunshine destroy in mode 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 sunshine destroys 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 I made it very clear that at the moment 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 I want to participate in nothing of any 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.250
 competitive mode 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 I'll be playing a lot in it. 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.600
 be playing more professional too 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.899
 left demolition sentenced but I want to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.690
 bring a lot here to promote the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 Sanchez game destroys what will be called 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 in search of moab in 72 exchange would be 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 basically the title gives a title to the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.400
 Our series , right? 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 I want to try to at least get there. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.670
 not right 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.970
 I do not know if this series will have a child. 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.009
 it will not last for a few years but I do not 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 I wanted to try on something like that. 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 This is a real challenge. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 mobbing cech and destroys and today I am 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.270
 starting today in this series with this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 gameplay and I 'll tell you what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 how will the rules of this 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.640
 series right 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.680
 As I go back we bring the videos like 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 that goes like it's going to be mechanical is not 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.409
 how is it going to be the structure of this 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.329
 series to 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.250
 so it's the next one for you to get 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.780
 organ and is destroyed 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 everybody knows you have to do 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.259
 25 kilos is the 24 of species being treated 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 de moby and I'll use the pieces or 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.380
 I already told you that I do not play. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.409
 in this industry 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.990
 without its species to many people candy 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.000
 likes to play and salt because of the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.850
 raising support analyst because of the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.740
 if I had not 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.360
 It really is an option I do not like that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 I like to play, says your beginning. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 I think there are many more 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.510
 advantage than you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.250
 play assault hot so much so that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.860
 you play the assault you'll get a 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.530
 building the producer will kill one or 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 two will not count as kill for oab 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 then if you send a snake also the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.100
 strikes do not count, they are not 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 cumulative so sometimes that's why 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.900
 I prefer right you have the player 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.240
 I told you that you have the option of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.310
 no handles think very important 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.410
 aspect that I ended up seeing that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.350
 very very very important 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.760
 R with the park one for me is more 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.330
 important together with the extreme 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.450
 condition no pec2 I think it's a lot 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.959
 important to take care of and also after 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.980
 gray by much use of doorman 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.550
 radar and in the near 37 indispensable to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.709
 the use of designers and how now 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.390
 SICREDI also have the option of 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.760
 replace pro 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.190
 it has that option that leaves the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.220
 ability to listen to the steps of the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.769
 enemies with even a design 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.680
 so it's know are things that play 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.380
 now imposes on people 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.870
 even more force you to play species 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.200
 for whom I do not know the rules of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.130
 tournaments championships suddenly in br 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.100
 beautiful gb on all of these sites is 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.049
 Who has the tournaments and I do not know 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.900
 how this can play crepes 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.190
 and can see the species can be played from 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.500
 all but I'm going to do my class of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.150
 and the intention is if I do not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.880
 get to at least get more 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.260
 near the oab and today I started this 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.959
 gameplay with strike of 14 fourteen kills 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.900
 And this is the first game I'm playing. 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.940
 enjoying the show and how it works 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.000
 I'm going to bet every game. 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.450
 where I can make up that strike 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 my that started today with 14 né I did 14 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.829
 that you are and I am bringing 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.900
 start this series 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.780
 If tomorrow I can make an MP with 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.079
 15 the brics will be able to do 15 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.360
 He died in them 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.819
 I'll be wearing it because then 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.280
 it's a bigger strike and it's going to come along with 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.310
 the series and so on is every time 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.689
 harder to bring gameplay 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.069
 for seriously because it increases 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.620
 strike right 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.599
 summarizing or I'll just bring it now 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 an upcoming game for this series 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.000
 when I make more than 14 pounds and this 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.729
 does not include type I did a gameplay 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.520
 those days of 18/4 né 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.030
 this gameplay would enter the case 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.639
 not because because the gameplay she was 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.590
 broken is the street was cracked 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.270
 so did 18 that but actually 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.150
 Bigger strike was not I think today 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.120
 we much because actually I got 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.800
 two specimens good then do not count 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.530
 broke and no longer counts 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.370
 I want to bring the same negão districts 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.849
 strix would be close to get the mohave 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.770
 huh 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.050
 and this is my intention if it will 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.580
 right or not I do not know can be that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740
 lasted a long time said that the series did not 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.430
 End it, because we do not know how 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.500
 and that is 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.430
 it's a goal it's a lot of people challenge 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.259
 is asking 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.259
 I know you could be talking there. 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.360
 the question of playing with 11 with a shield does not 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.719
 It's a matter of asking the guys to set up a 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.270
 part goes pro rad is with hotmail or 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.099
 Exploding there but I want to avoid this. 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.139
 for now I wanted to play normally 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.639
 it's not trying to see if there's any 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.229
 possibility or not after as 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.219
 teacher of little that does not 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.199
 right 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.419
 I may be trying to make a wall 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.460
 to do something of the scheme to 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.219
 people see if it's even possible not to like 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.930
 it's hard difficulty is such to 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.819
 It becomes a different thing and how to 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.860
 was a challenge for the channel, right? 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.099
 You can go with a lot of people. 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.050
 You're asking for a tasty challenge. 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.400
 is trying to catch a man only destroys to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.740
 it's hard as hell 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.560
 You have to do all the rounds there. 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.500
 have to do more than six rounds and 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.089
 so there are enough of me there to see 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.949
 What are you giving me? I'm bringing this 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.830
 gameplay for you today 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.319
 just for you to see no scheme that 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.969
 It will be in this gameplay that Brazil today 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.120
 I went in the middle of the match was 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.190
 super excited because he was with 10 11 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.110
 but I did not even remember that we already 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.150
 was already in the third quarter round if 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.030
 I'm not mistaken, I got in the beginning. 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.919
 of the second round and if I had not I 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.139
 had at the beginning of the match and had 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.720
 with all the skills I 'm sure 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.300
 have to give a little more 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.550
 end up dying after him in the end and 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.100
 because I knew I would not give time 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.979
 I was pulling right up to the 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.729
 front of enemies and did not give 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:00.610
 very sure but what counts there is the strike 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:03.729
 of 14 that I'm bringing in to 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.100
 start this series that started today and 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.050
 these rules that's how I got a 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.449
 greater than 14 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.820
 I'll be bringing you here until 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:15.460
 who knows someday I can do the 24 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.539
 pounds and I can bring a web 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.210

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.949
 on your xvii and destroy then guys I'll 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.050
 Say goodbye to you, I hope you 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.699

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.530
 video leaves your license 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.289
 to assist in the dissemination of the 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.820
 material value the work of the channel 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.740
 not that it takes too much work to bring 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.349

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.720
