turned out I figured I'd share what I
learned<00:00:16.170> along<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> way<00:00:16.640> I'm<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.060> bit

learned along the way I'm a little bit
of<00:00:18.240> other<00:00:18.359> stuff<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.609> first<00:00:20.640> set

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
of other stuff I know so the first set

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.880 
of other stuff I know so the first set
of<00:00:20.970> clubs<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.390> bought<00:00:21.570> many<00:00:21.720> years<00:00:22.020> ago<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.560> a

of clubs I bought many years ago was a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.410 
of clubs I bought many years ago was a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.779 
set while the percent of decent clubs
was<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> set<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.320> Todd<00:00:25.560> Smith's<00:00:26.010> which<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.609> can

now<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.449> beat<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> health<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:29.420> didn't

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
now see are all beat to health I didn't

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
now see are all beat to health I didn't
really<00:00:30.599> look<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.900> Todd<00:00:31.080> Smith<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.009> time

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really look at Todd Smith much this time

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.120 
really look at Todd Smith much this time
around<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.940> don't<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.660> why<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.770> they're

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
around I don't know why I think they're

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.440 
around I don't know why I think they're
even<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> main<00:00:35.579> reason<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.880> bought<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.210> years

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
even the main reason I bought them years

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.700 
even the main reason I bought them years
and<00:00:36.480> years<00:00:36.630> ago<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.380> were<00:00:37.440> very

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and years ago is they were very

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
and years ago is they were very
comparable<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.640> Bay's<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.390> were

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
comparable to the do Bay's but they were

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
comparable to the do Bay's but they were
a<00:00:39.540> couple<00:00:39.780> dollars<00:00:40.170> cheaper<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.710> club<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
a couple dollars cheaper for club and I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950 
a couple dollars cheaper for club and I
was<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> high<00:00:41.820> school<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> mattered<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
was in high school so that mattered to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
was in high school so that mattered to
me<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> lot

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
me a lot

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
me a lot
comparison<00:00:45.239> wise<00:00:45.360> I'll<00:00:45.629> note<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.079> things

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
comparison wise I'll note some things

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.310 
comparison wise I'll note some things
like<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> Todd<00:00:48.329> Smith<00:00:48.629> clubs<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.170> are

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
like the Todd Smith clubs and these are

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
like the Todd Smith clubs and these are
really<00:00:49.500> dated<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.430> they

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
really dated so for all I know they

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
really dated so for all I know they
weren't<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> anymore<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> knob<00:00:52.949> on

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
weren't like this anymore the knob on

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
weren't like this anymore the knob on
the<00:00:53.340> Todd<00:00:53.610> Smith<00:00:53.910> does<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> screw<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the Todd Smith does not have a screw in

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.560 
the Todd Smith does not have a screw in
it<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.289> solid<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.550> end<00:00:56.730> cap<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> Todd

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it it's solid the end cap and the Todd

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.430 
it it's solid the end cap and the Todd
Smith<00:00:57.930> has<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.530> couple<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.129> Brad's<00:00:59.430> small<00:01:00.180> nails

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
Smith has a couple of Brad's small nails

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.470 
Smith has a couple of Brad's small nails
attacking<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
attacking them in but other than that it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.020 
attacking them in but other than that it
looks<00:01:03.530> extremely<00:01:04.530> similar<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.400> standard

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
looks extremely similar to a standard

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
looks extremely similar to a standard
Brian<00:01:06.479> Dube<00:01:06.750> European<00:01:07.260> club<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.710> you've

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
Brian Dube European club that you've

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
Brian Dube European club that you've
probably<00:01:07.950> seen<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> million<00:01:08.580> times<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
probably seen a million times over it is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
probably seen a million times over it is
a<00:01:10.110> little<00:01:10.409> bit<00:01:10.619> shorter<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
a little bit shorter and I'm sure that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.100 
a little bit shorter and I'm sure that
their<00:01:12.150> websites<00:01:12.600> will<00:01:12.750> give<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
their websites will give you the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
their websites will give you the
official<00:01:13.500> specs<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> would

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
official specs on all these but I would

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.570 
official specs on all these but I would
guess<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> half<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.720> inch<00:01:15.810> shorter

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
guess it's about a half an inch shorter

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.490 
guess it's about a half an inch shorter
but<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> said<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.180> perfectly<00:01:18.720> fair<00:01:19.229> or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
but like I said to be perfectly fair or

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
but like I said to be perfectly fair or
unfair<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.040> didn't<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.670> give<00:01:21.090> Todd<00:01:21.420> Smith<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
unfair I didn't really give Todd Smith a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.510 
unfair I didn't really give Todd Smith a
fair<00:01:22.140> shake<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.310> around

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
fair shake and all this this time around

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.679 
fair shake and all this this time around
so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> had<00:01:24.720> been<00:01:24.750> using<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.770> Brian<00:01:26.070> debates

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
so I had been using these Brian debates

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.859 
so I had been using these Brian debates
for<00:01:27.689> many<00:01:28.110> years<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:30.210> didn't<00:01:30.780> have

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
for many years now and I didn't have

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
for many years now and I didn't have
much<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> good<00:01:31.409> reason<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.770> replacing<00:01:32.490> them

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
much of a good reason for replacing them

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
much of a good reason for replacing them
I<00:01:32.790> suppose<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.630> getting<00:01:34.170> itchy<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I suppose I was just getting itchy for a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.670 
I suppose I was just getting itchy for a
new<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> new<00:01:35.579> toy<00:01:36.290> they've<00:01:37.290> held<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.619> very

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
new for a new toy they've held up very

shape

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.910 
shape
know<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> difference<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.740> have

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the screw in the bottom I think do bass

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
the screw in the bottom I think do bass
still<00:01:46.259> does<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.579> guess<00:01:47.909> some

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
still does this which I guess some

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.490 
still does this which I guess some
people<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.659> I've<00:01:48.899> heard<00:01:49.079> concerns

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
people don't like I've heard concerns

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
people don't like I've heard concerns
about<00:01:49.649> injuries<00:01:50.280> though<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> don't<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.270> how

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
about injuries though I don't know how

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990 
about injuries though I don't know how
I'd<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.840> hurt<00:01:52.020> myself<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> end

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
I'd really hurt myself with that the end

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
I'd really hurt myself with that the end
caps<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.509> solid<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.110> glued<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.799> mean

caps are solid and are glued on I mean

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.709 
caps are solid and are glued on I mean
one<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> reasons<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.180> went<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> Todd

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
one of the reasons I went with the Todd

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
one of the reasons I went with the Todd
Smith<00:01:58.049> years<00:01:58.259> ago<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.520> was

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
Smith years ago as well is because I was

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.240 
Smith years ago as well is because I was
I<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.350> mean<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.710> three<00:02:01.860> someone's<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I take that I mean one three someone's a

I take that I mean one three someone's a
do<00:02:02.369> Bay's<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.880> second<00:02:03.180> time<00:02:03.299> around<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
do Bay's the second time around is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
do Bay's the second time around is
because<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.170> seemed<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> me<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.100> would

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
because this seemed to me like it would

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.449 
because this seemed to me like it would
be<00:02:05.369> easier<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> replace<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> knobs<00:02:06.840> went

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
be easier to replace if the knobs went

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.859 
be easier to replace if the knobs went
but<00:02:08.459> none<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:08.789> knobs<00:02:09.000> had<00:02:09.239> ever<00:02:09.360> gone<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
but none of my knobs had ever gone on a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
but none of my knobs had ever gone on a
club<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.619> I've<00:02:10.770> used<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.430> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
club and as much as I've used them so I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.589 
club and as much as I've used them so I
don't<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.760> why<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.270> worried<00:02:12.540> about

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
don't know why I was so worried about

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.339 
don't know why I was so worried about
that<00:02:12.900> anyway<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.629> one<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> things<00:02:16.050> that

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
that anyway so one of the things that

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.110 
that anyway so one of the things that
got<00:02:16.530> me<00:02:16.560> looking<00:02:17.010> around<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.459> little<00:02:17.580> bit<00:02:17.790> more

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
got me looking around a little bit more

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.670 
got me looking around a little bit more
this<00:02:18.330> time<00:02:18.540> around<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.050> these<00:02:19.319> clubs

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that is I'm a win

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.280 
that is I'm a win
cuz<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> went<00:02:24.510> many<00:02:24.780> years<00:02:24.959> where<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> wasn't

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
cuz I went many years where I wasn't

my hands a bit the grips feel pretty

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.259 
my hands a bit the grips feel pretty
hard<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.440> me<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.760> watched<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.150> lot<00:02:33.209> of

renegade<00:02:36.060> clubs<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.260> sounded<00:02:37.680> softer<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
renegade clubs it just sounded softer to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.759 
renegade clubs it just sounded softer to
me<00:02:38.660> now<00:02:39.660> years<00:02:39.870> ago<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.290> fought<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.650> do

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
me now years ago when I fought to do

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.600 
me now years ago when I fought to do
BAE's<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:42.470> seen<00:02:43.470> renegade<00:02:43.890> clubs<00:02:44.160> at<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> time

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
BAE's I seen renegade clubs at the time

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.729 
BAE's I seen renegade clubs at the time
I<00:02:44.640> did<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.269> them<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:46.440> are<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> few

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
I did not like them and there are a few

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.420 
I did not like them and there are a few
reasons<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
reasons for that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.640 
reasons for that
the<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:47.940> they<00:02:48.060> felt<00:02:48.239> very<00:02:48.360> fat<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.989> me<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.379> here

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the one they felt very fat to me up here

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.369 
the one they felt very fat to me up here
in<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.830> barrel<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.050> appealing

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
in the barrel and that was not appealing

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.920 
in the barrel and that was not appealing
to<00:02:52.590> me<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.769> all<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.849> hated<00:02:54.120> their<00:02:54.360> grips<00:02:54.629> at

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to me at all and I hated their grips at

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.770 
to me at all and I hated their grips at
the<00:02:55.170> time<00:02:55.430> they<00:02:56.430> did<00:02:56.610> not<00:02:56.640> offer<00:02:57.000> taped<00:02:57.390> grips

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the time they did not offer taped grips

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.720 
the time they did not offer taped grips
so<00:02:58.050> their<00:02:58.379> grips<00:02:58.650> were<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.340> recall<00:02:59.610> they're

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
so their grips were as I recall they're

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.610 
so their grips were as I recall they're
plastic<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.629> had<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> lot<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.170> kind<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.440> rough

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
plastic and I had a lot of kind of rough

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.440 
plastic and I had a lot of kind of rough
edges<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.190> them<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:03.150> found<00:03:03.269> them

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
edges on them and I just found them

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.259 
edges on them and I just found them
really<00:03:03.780> uncomfortable<00:03:04.790> when<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.819> did<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> little

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
really uncomfortable when I did a little

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.670 
really uncomfortable when I did a little
bit<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.540> homework<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:06.930> around<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.530> found

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
bit of homework this time around I found

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.589 
bit of homework this time around I found
that<00:03:07.890> renegade<00:03:08.159> has<00:03:08.610> has<00:03:09.060> changed<00:03:09.450> their

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
that renegade has has changed their

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.259 
that renegade has has changed their
offerings<00:03:10.080> quite<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> bit<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.519> they're<00:03:12.239> very

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
offerings quite a bit so they're very

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.920 
offerings quite a bit so they're very
customizable<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.620> terms<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.069> size<00:03:14.930> length

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
customizable in terms of size length

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.100 
customizable in terms of size length
weight<00:03:16.909> colors<00:03:17.909> all<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.599> good<00:03:18.810> stuff

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
weight colors all that good stuff

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.740 
weight colors all that good stuff
in<00:03:19.950> particular<00:03:20.489> they're<00:03:20.670> customizable<00:03:21.209> in

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
in particular they're customizable in

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.670 
in particular they're customizable in
the<00:03:21.989> width<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.040> body<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.440> they're<00:03:25.440> old

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the width of the body so they're old

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.759 
the width of the body so they're old
standard<00:03:26.340> was<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.690> 95<00:03:27.690> millimeter<00:03:28.170> Club<00:03:28.470> which

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
standard was a 95 millimeter Club which

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.320 
standard was a 95 millimeter Club which
is<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> thing<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.280> thought<00:03:29.489> was<00:03:29.640> fat<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.269> I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
is the thing I thought was fat and I

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.759 
is the thing I thought was fat and I
still<00:03:30.599> probably<00:03:30.840> would<00:03:31.140> think<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.409> was<00:03:31.500> kind

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
still probably would think it was kind

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.949 
still probably would think it was kind
of<00:03:31.830> too<00:03:32.010> fat<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.549> liking<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.659> they<00:03:33.810> now

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
of too fat for my liking but they now

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.380 
of too fat for my liking but they now
offer<00:03:34.140> an<00:03:34.409> 85<00:03:34.920> millimeter<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.970> Dube

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
offer an 85 millimeter and this Dube

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.809 
offer an 85 millimeter and this Dube
that<00:03:36.720> I've<00:03:36.810> been<00:03:36.900> using<00:03:37.080> forever<00:03:37.379> is<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:38.010> an<00:03:38.250> 83

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
that I've been using forever is is an 83

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.699 
that I've been using forever is is an 83
or<00:03:38.940> 84<00:03:39.030> millimeters<00:03:39.599> so<00:03:40.049> you're<00:03:40.260> not<00:03:40.379> even<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
or 84 millimeters so you're not even to

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.490 
or 84 millimeters so you're not even to
notice<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.159> difference<00:03:41.489> like<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.659> that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
notice the difference like that so that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.430 
notice the difference like that so that
concern<00:03:44.069> goes<00:03:44.340> away<00:03:45.049> they<00:03:46.049> also<00:03:46.200> now<00:03:46.409> offer

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
concern goes away they also now offer

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.520 
concern goes away they also now offer
taped<00:03:46.980> handles<00:03:47.489> which<00:03:47.670> they<00:03:47.819> didn't<00:03:48.030> used<00:03:48.209> to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
taped handles which they didn't used to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.750 
taped handles which they didn't used to
and<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.830> thought<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.430> might<00:03:50.640> help

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and so I thought that might help

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.350 
and so I thought that might help
with<00:03:52.300> my<00:03:52.450> concerns<00:03:52.840> about<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.200> grips<00:03:54.360> beyond

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
with my concerns about the grips beyond

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.030 
with my concerns about the grips beyond
that<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.200> think<00:03:56.349> they<00:03:56.590> look<00:03:56.769> kind<00:03:56.980> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that I just I think they look kind of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.470 
that I just I think they look kind of
nice<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.489> lots<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.730> people<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.120> him<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:58.420> I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
nice and lots of people like him so I

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.380 
nice and lots of people like him so I
figured<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.840> was<00:03:58.930> time<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.140> give<00:03:59.349> them<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.530> shot

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
figured it was time to give them a shot

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.940 
figured it was time to give them a shot
but<00:04:01.390> realistically<00:04:01.959> as<00:04:02.410> they<00:04:02.590> were<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
but realistically as they were in the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.380 
but realistically as they were in the
mail<00:04:03.129> I<00:04:03.160> figured<00:04:03.760> they<00:04:03.879> were<00:04:03.940> gonna<00:04:04.150> arrive

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
mail I figured they were gonna arrive

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.699 
mail I figured they were gonna arrive
and<00:04:04.660> they<00:04:04.720> really<00:04:04.989> were<00:04:05.110> not<00:04:05.170> going<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.560> be

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
and they really were not going to be

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.400 
and they really were not going to be
very<00:04:05.890> different<00:04:06.129> at<00:04:06.489> all

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
very different at all

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.860 
very different at all
but<00:04:08.410> they<00:04:08.530> look<00:04:08.769> cool<00:04:09.269> once<00:04:10.269> they<00:04:10.420> arrived<00:04:10.660> up

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
but they look cool once they arrived up

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.509 
but they look cool once they arrived up
and<00:04:11.019> they<00:04:11.110> actually<00:04:11.230> are<00:04:11.500> quite<00:04:11.590> different<00:04:12.069> in

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
and they actually are quite different in

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.000 
and they actually are quite different in
a<00:04:12.880> number<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.209> small<00:04:13.569> ways<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:13.840> all<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.860> all

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
a number of small ways and all in all

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.650 
a number of small ways and all in all
though<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.220> love<00:04:15.459> Bryan<00:04:15.700> Dube<00:04:15.940> I've<00:04:16.419> bought<00:04:16.630> a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
though I love Bryan Dube I've bought a

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.780 
though I love Bryan Dube I've bought a
lot<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.989> their<00:04:17.079> equipment<00:04:17.139> I<00:04:17.709> think<00:04:17.790> they're

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
lot of their equipment I think they're

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.250 
lot of their equipment I think they're
really<00:04:19.000> good<00:04:19.150> people<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:19.959> wouldn't

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
really good people and I wouldn't

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.840 
really good people and I wouldn't
hesitate<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.650> buy<00:04:20.889> them<00:04:21.190> again<00:04:21.430> I'm<00:04:21.609> pretty

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
hesitate to buy them again I'm pretty

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.670 
hesitate to buy them again I'm pretty
pleased<00:04:22.120> with<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.900> running<00:04:23.139> gait<00:04:23.260> clubs<00:04:23.530> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
pleased with the running gait clubs that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.980 
pleased with the running gait clubs that
showed<00:04:23.919> up<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.850> here's<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> couple<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> main

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
showed up so here's a couple of the main

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.200 
showed up so here's a couple of the main
differences<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.560> noticed<00:04:26.889> one<00:04:27.760> was<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.090> a

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
differences I noticed one was just a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
differences I noticed one was just a
pretty<00:04:28.389> big<00:04:28.570> cosmetic<00:04:29.110> difference<00:04:29.470> here<00:04:29.740> up

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
pretty big cosmetic difference here up

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.680 
pretty big cosmetic difference here up
in<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.400> barrel<00:04:31.260> they're<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.410> same<00:04:32.590> size<00:04:33.690> that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
in the barrel they're the same size that

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.480 
in the barrel they're the same size that
alike<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.320> clubs<00:04:35.590> on<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.770> whole<00:04:36.070> are

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
alike so the clubs on the whole are

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.610 
alike so the clubs on the whole are
pretty<00:04:36.729> comparable<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.900> renegade<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.590> a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
pretty comparable the renegade is a

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.530 
pretty comparable the renegade is a
little<00:04:39.130> bit<00:04:39.250> shorter<00:04:39.639> which<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.060> wanted<00:04:40.389> about

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
little bit shorter which I wanted about

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.360 
little bit shorter which I wanted about
a<00:04:40.660> half<00:04:40.900> an<00:04:41.020> inch<00:04:41.110> shorter<00:04:41.530> they'll<00:04:41.800> customize

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
a half an inch shorter they'll customize

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.390 
a half an inch shorter they'll customize
them<00:04:42.580> different<00:04:43.300> lengths<00:04:43.660> but<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:45.100> I

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
them different lengths but I just I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.800 
them different lengths but I just I
wanted<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.880> little<00:04:46.090> bit<00:04:46.270> shorter<00:04:46.630> than<00:04:46.750> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
wanted it a little bit shorter than the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.260 
wanted it a little bit shorter than the
debates<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.260> was<00:04:47.350> used<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:48.880> can<00:04:49.090> see

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
debates I was used to but you can see

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.330 
debates I was used to but you can see
what<00:04:49.389> happens<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.930> barrel<00:04:50.320> here<00:04:50.560> at<00:04:51.100> least

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
what happens in the barrel here at least

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.820 
what happens in the barrel here at least
I<00:04:51.430> think<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.700> can<00:04:51.850> see<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.229> did<00:04:53.229> you<00:04:53.320> pay<00:04:53.530> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
I think you can see that did you pay the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.469 
I think you can see that did you pay the
white<00:04:53.979> part<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.370> barrel<00:04:54.700> is<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:55.090> pretty

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
white part of the barrel is is pretty

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.510 
white part of the barrel is is pretty
long<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.930> fact<00:04:56.169> whereas<00:04:56.830> renegade<00:04:57.400> has

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
long in fact whereas renegade has

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.159 
long in fact whereas renegade has
devoted<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:58.060> lot<00:04:58.210> more<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.690> body<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.139> the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
devoted a lot more of the body of the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.950 
devoted a lot more of the body of the
club<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.220> decorations<00:05:00.639> which<00:05:01.600> was<00:05:01.930> a

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
club to the decorations which was a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240 
club to the decorations which was a
little<00:05:02.229> jarring<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.680> me<00:05:02.770> at<00:05:02.860> first<00:05:03.100> just

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
little jarring to me at first just

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.590 
little jarring to me at first just
because<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> looks<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:03.820> different<00:05:04.120> but<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.510> do

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
because it looks so different but I do

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
because it looks so different but I do
think<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.020> looks<00:05:05.169> better<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:05.680> looks<00:05:05.919> nicer<00:05:07.620> the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
think it looks better it looks nicer the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.700 
think it looks better it looks nicer the
knobs<00:05:08.860> are<00:05:09.070> different<00:05:09.400> here<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:11.260> renegade

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
knobs are different here the renegade

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.010 
knobs are different here the renegade
goes<00:05:11.979> back<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.430> them<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.970> old<00:05:13.389> Todd<00:05:13.660> Smith

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
goes back to them the old Todd Smith

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
goes back to them the old Todd Smith
days<00:05:14.289> for<00:05:14.620> me<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.070> it<00:05:15.190> does<00:05:15.310> not<00:05:15.430> have<00:05:15.669> a

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
days for me and that it does not have a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.520 
days for me and that it does not have a
screw<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> base<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.690> has<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.810> pre<00:05:17.169> broad

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
screw in the base it has a pre broad

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.010 
screw in the base it has a pre broad
flat<00:05:17.950> knob<00:05:18.490> which<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.510> really<00:05:19.810> nice<00:05:19.990> for

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
flat knob which is really nice for

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.379 
flat knob which is really nice for
balancing<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:20.919> so<00:05:21.100> on<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.669> guess<00:05:21.880> maybe<00:05:22.120> it

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
balancing and so on and I guess maybe it

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.150 
balancing and so on and I guess maybe it
should<00:05:22.600> raise<00:05:22.780> my<00:05:22.990> concern<00:05:23.380> again<00:05:23.680> about<00:05:23.950> what

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
should raise my concern again about what

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.500 
should raise my concern again about what
will<00:05:24.310> happen<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.729> day<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:24.940> need<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.180> replace

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
will happen the day I need to replace

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.240 
will happen the day I need to replace
the<00:05:25.750> knobs<00:05:25.960> but<00:05:26.289> again<00:05:26.530> I've<00:05:26.680> never<00:05:26.710> had<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.100> do

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
the knobs but again I've never had to do

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.890 
the knobs but again I've never had to do
that<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.729> don't<00:05:27.760> know<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.030> think<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:28.510> care<00:05:28.720> so

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
that so I don't know I think I care so

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.579 
that so I don't know I think I care so
much<00:05:28.960> about<00:05:29.110> that

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.979 

the<00:05:31.889> real<00:05:32.159> pleasant<00:05:32.639> surprise<00:05:32.969> for<00:05:33.269> me<00:05:33.449> has

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:33.989 
the real pleasant surprise for me has

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.589 
the real pleasant surprise for me has
been<00:05:34.259> in<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.499> handles<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.279> had<00:05:36.029> said<00:05:36.329> on<00:05:36.479> the

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
been in the handles I had said on the

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.959 
been in the handles I had said on the
web<00:05:36.749> that<00:05:37.109> they<00:05:37.469> sounded<00:05:38.069> different<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:38.849> me

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
web that they sounded different to me

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.629 
web that they sounded different to me
and<00:05:39.299> I<00:05:40.109> decided<00:05:40.829> that<00:05:41.009> that<00:05:41.279> was<00:05:41.399> probably

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
and I decided that that was probably

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.059 
and I decided that that was probably
just<00:05:41.879> me<00:05:41.969> being<00:05:42.149> stupid<00:05:42.209> now<00:05:42.929> that<00:05:43.709> I<00:05:43.769> played

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
just me being stupid now that I played

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.249 
just me being stupid now that I played
with<00:05:44.099> both<00:05:44.429> I<00:05:44.609> really<00:05:44.999> don't<00:05:45.179> think<00:05:45.239> it<00:05:45.449> is<00:05:45.599> and

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
with both I really don't think it is and

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.049 
with both I really don't think it is and
if<00:05:46.559> you<00:05:46.649> have<00:05:46.769> a<00:05:46.799> chance<00:05:47.069> to<00:05:47.279> feel<00:05:47.489> both<00:05:47.849> of

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:48.059 
if you have a chance to feel both of

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.419 
if you have a chance to feel both of
them<00:05:48.349> before<00:05:49.349> you<00:05:49.559> make<00:05:49.769> up<00:05:49.799> your<00:05:49.919> mind<00:05:50.069> I'd

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:50.429 
them before you make up your mind I'd

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:53.149 
them before you make up your mind I'd
recommend<00:05:50.879> you<00:05:50.969> do<00:05:51.179> so<00:05:51.419> I<00:05:51.689> can<00:05:52.499> try<00:05:52.709> to<00:05:52.769> do<00:05:52.979> this

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
recommend you do so I can try to do this

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.679 
recommend you do so I can try to do this
but<00:05:53.369> I<00:05:53.399> doubt<00:05:53.519> it's<00:05:53.819> gonna<00:05:53.909> translate<00:05:54.209> at<00:05:54.569> all

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
but I doubt it's gonna translate at all

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.839 
but I doubt it's gonna translate at all
to<00:05:54.839> video<00:05:55.049> if<00:05:55.619> I<00:05:55.769> throw<00:05:56.009> the<00:05:56.129> Dubey<00:05:56.399> and<00:05:56.639> catch

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
to video if I throw the Dubey and catch

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.039 
to video if I throw the Dubey and catch
it<00:05:56.879> I<00:05:57.269> don't<00:05:57.539> know<00:05:57.599> if<00:05:57.689> you'll<00:05:57.779> be<00:05:57.869> able<00:05:57.899> to

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:58.049 
it I don't know if you'll be able to

00:05:58.049 --> 00:05:59.449 
it I don't know if you'll be able to
hear<00:05:58.259> the<00:05:58.379> difference<00:05:58.499> between<00:05:59.039> these<00:05:59.129> two<00:05:59.339> at

00:05:59.449 --> 00:05:59.459 
hear the difference between these two at

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.579 
hear the difference between these two at
all<00:05:59.579> and<00:05:59.879> again<00:06:00.179> these<00:06:00.749> are<00:06:00.869> do<00:06:00.989> Bay's<00:06:01.199> even

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:01.589 
all and again these are do Bay's even

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:02.899 
all and again these are do Bay's even
are<00:06:01.679> pretty<00:06:01.859> old<00:06:01.979> by<00:06:02.219> now<00:06:02.249> so<00:06:02.519> it's<00:06:02.639> possible

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
are pretty old by now so it's possible

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.579 
are pretty old by now so it's possible
they've<00:06:03.359> changed<00:06:03.599> their<00:06:03.809> grips<00:06:04.049> but<00:06:04.319> I<00:06:04.349> don't

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
they've changed their grips but I don't

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:05.149 
they've changed their grips but I don't
think<00:06:04.739> so

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
think so

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.719 
think so
so<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.759> Dube<00:06:08.449> when<00:06:09.449> it<00:06:09.569> hits<00:06:10.339> it's<00:06:11.339> kind<00:06:11.609> of<00:06:11.639> a

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
so the Dube when it hits it's kind of a

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:18.139 
so the Dube when it hits it's kind of a
hard<00:06:12.059> slapping<00:06:12.779> sound<00:06:13.909> the<00:06:14.909> renegade<00:06:16.879> is<00:06:17.879> more

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:18.149 
hard slapping sound the renegade is more

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:21.859 
hard slapping sound the renegade is more
of<00:06:18.239> a<00:06:18.329> hollow<00:06:18.569> kind<00:06:19.499> of<00:06:19.589> funky<00:06:20.069> sound<00:06:20.429> and<00:06:20.869> it's

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:21.869 
of a hollow kind of funky sound and it's

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:23.509 
of a hollow kind of funky sound and it's
weird<00:06:22.169> it's<00:06:22.409> hard<00:06:22.589> for<00:06:22.739> me<00:06:22.829> to<00:06:22.919> describe<00:06:23.249> his

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:23.519 
weird it's hard for me to describe his

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:26.599 
weird it's hard for me to describe his
feels<00:06:23.939> it's<00:06:24.569> not<00:06:24.839> but<00:06:25.769> it<00:06:25.889> feels<00:06:26.189> like<00:06:26.459> the

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:26.609 
feels it's not but it feels like the

clubs have come a long way and are
really<00:06:51.059> worth<00:06:51.179> looking<00:06:51.419> at<00:06:51.719> anyway<00:06:52.079> both

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
really worth looking at anyway both

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.279 
really worth looking at anyway both
because<00:06:53.279> of<00:06:53.309> the<00:06:53.489> comfort<00:06:53.849> of<00:06:53.909> the<00:06:54.029> grip<00:06:54.289> the

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
because of the comfort of the grip the

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.929 
because of the comfort of the grip the
appearance<00:06:55.709> is<00:06:55.889> nice<00:06:56.069> the<00:06:56.279> debate<00:06:56.549> has<00:06:56.729> more

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
appearance is nice the debate has more

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.899 
appearance is nice the debate has more
decoration<00:06:57.539> options<00:06:57.899> than<00:06:58.110> they<00:06:58.199> used<00:06:58.379> to

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
decoration options than they used to

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.999 
decoration options than they used to
anything<00:06:59.909> you'd<00:07:00.179> want<00:07:00.209> in<00:07:00.509> terms<00:07:00.719> of

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
anything you'd want in terms of

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.139 
anything you'd want in terms of
customization<00:07:02.009> of<00:07:02.159> the<00:07:02.309> length<00:07:02.549> or<00:07:02.819> the<00:07:02.939> width

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:03.149 
customization of the length or the width

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:04.729 
customization of the length or the width
or<00:07:03.389> the<00:07:03.539> weight<00:07:03.749> of<00:07:03.929> the<00:07:03.989> club<00:07:04.109> or<00:07:04.439> any<00:07:04.559> gait

or the weight of the club or any gait

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:06.019 
or the weight of the club or any gait
seems<00:07:05.009> to<00:07:05.099> have<00:07:05.189> all<00:07:05.339> that<00:07:05.489> covered<00:07:05.879> these

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
seems to have all that covered these

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:07.549 
seems to have all that covered these
days<00:07:06.239> oh<00:07:06.479> there<00:07:07.049> is<00:07:07.139> one<00:07:07.169> other<00:07:07.409> difference

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:07.559 
days oh there is one other difference

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.859 
days oh there is one other difference
that's<00:07:07.829> gonna<00:07:07.949> mention<00:07:08.339> I<00:07:08.909> almost<00:07:09.269> forgot<00:07:09.599> if

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:09.869 
that's gonna mention I almost forgot if

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:11.929 
that's gonna mention I almost forgot if
if<00:07:10.559> we<00:07:10.769> put<00:07:10.919> the<00:07:11.009> clips<00:07:11.189> outside<00:07:11.549> you<00:07:11.669> can<00:07:11.789> see

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
if we put the clips outside you can see

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.819 
if we put the clips outside you can see
that<00:07:12.089> the<00:07:12.209> renegade<00:07:12.629> the<00:07:12.959> grip<00:07:13.259> actually<00:07:13.649> goes

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:13.829 
that the renegade the grip actually goes

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:15.709 
that the renegade the grip actually goes
up<00:07:14.069> a<00:07:14.189> little<00:07:14.309> bit<00:07:14.519> higher

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719 
up a little bit higher

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.289 
up a little bit higher
it<00:07:16.499> may<00:07:16.739> just<00:07:17.009> yeah<00:07:17.579> it's<00:07:17.699> not<00:07:17.849> even<00:07:17.999> that<00:07:18.089> time

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:18.299 
it may just yeah it's not even that time

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:20.719 
it may just yeah it's not even that time
it<00:07:18.719> really<00:07:19.019> is<00:07:19.109> a<00:07:19.139> longer<00:07:19.499> grip<00:07:19.769> I<00:07:20.069> think<00:07:20.639> I

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
it really is a longer grip I think I

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.069 
it really is a longer grip I think I
have<00:07:20.879> those<00:07:20.999> about<00:07:21.209> parallel<00:07:21.629> for<00:07:21.809> you<00:07:21.959> guys

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:22.079 
have those about parallel for you guys

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.779 
have those about parallel for you guys
here<00:07:22.259> is<00:07:22.349> probably<00:07:22.679> an<00:07:22.799> extra<00:07:22.979> inch<00:07:23.279> of<00:07:23.489> grip

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
here is probably an extra inch of grip

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.179 
here is probably an extra inch of grip
on<00:07:23.999> the<00:07:24.059> renegade<00:07:24.539> I<00:07:24.779> can't<00:07:25.409> say<00:07:25.589> I<00:07:25.619> love<00:07:25.979> the

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189 
on the renegade I can't say I love the

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.709 
on the renegade I can't say I love the
way<00:07:26.219> that<00:07:26.339> looks<00:07:26.909> but<00:07:27.179> I<00:07:27.209> don't<00:07:27.419> think<00:07:27.569> it

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
way that looks but I don't think it

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:28.839 
way that looks but I don't think it
looks<00:07:27.899> bad<00:07:28.229> it's

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
looks bad it's

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.919 
looks bad it's
different<00:07:29.740> and<00:07:30.879> in<00:07:31.879> terms<00:07:32.209> of<00:07:32.449> giving<00:07:32.779> you<00:07:32.869> a

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:32.929 
different and in terms of giving you a

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:34.989 
different and in terms of giving you a
bigger<00:07:33.169> caching<00:07:33.709> area<00:07:34.039> on<00:07:34.189> the<00:07:34.339> club<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.759> think

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:34.999 
bigger caching area on the club I think

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:38.079 
bigger caching area on the club I think
that<00:07:35.149> it's<00:07:35.300> just<00:07:35.539> fine<00:07:35.719> so<00:07:36.879> hopefully<00:07:37.879> that

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.089 
that it's just fine so hopefully that

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:39.609 
that it's just fine so hopefully that
helps<00:07:38.360> you<00:07:38.419> if<00:07:38.689> you're<00:07:38.839> considering<00:07:39.319> the<00:07:39.439> same

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:39.619 
helps you if you're considering the same

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.399 
helps you if you're considering the same
kind<00:07:39.830> of<00:07:39.889> decision<00:07:40.009> that<00:07:40.309> I<00:07:40.490> was<00:07:40.729> I<00:07:41.409> really

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.409 
kind of decision that I was I really

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:43.809 
kind of decision that I was I really
don't<00:07:42.589> think<00:07:42.619> you<00:07:42.800> can<00:07:42.949> go<00:07:43.069> wrong<00:07:43.309> with<00:07:43.789> either

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819 
don't think you can go wrong with either

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.730 
don't think you can go wrong with either
club<00:07:44.300> but<00:07:44.599> mostly<00:07:45.020> like<00:07:45.229> I<00:07:45.259> said<00:07:45.499> I<00:07:45.619> had

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
club but mostly like I said I had

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.049 
club but mostly like I said I had
convinced<00:07:46.159> myself<00:07:46.249> that<00:07:46.490> these<00:07:46.759> were<00:07:46.879> not

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:47.059 
convinced myself that these were not

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:48.639 
convinced myself that these were not
going<00:07:47.300> to<00:07:47.360> be<00:07:47.419> very<00:07:47.539> different<00:07:47.809> clubs<00:07:48.199> and<00:07:48.499> now

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:48.649 
going to be very different clubs and now

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:50.199 
going to be very different clubs and now
that<00:07:48.830> I've<00:07:48.919> had<00:07:49.069> them<00:07:49.189> both<00:07:49.309> of<00:07:49.490> my<00:07:49.580> hands<00:07:49.849> I

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:50.209 
that I've had them both of my hands I

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:52.260 
that I've had them both of my hands I
think<00:07:50.240> they<00:07:50.539> really<00:07:50.809> are<00:07:50.839> and<00:07:51.259> it's<00:07:51.379> worth

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270 
think they really are and it's worth

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.669 
think they really are and it's worth
seriously<00:07:53.300> weighing<00:07:53.929> the<00:07:54.169> decision<00:07:54.529> and

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:54.679 
seriously weighing the decision and

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:56.019 
seriously weighing the decision and
figuring<00:07:54.919> out<00:07:55.039> which<00:07:55.159> of<00:07:55.339> them<00:07:55.459> better<00:07:55.699> suits

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029 
figuring out which of them better suits

00:07:56.029 --> 00:08:00.009 
figuring out which of them better suits
your<00:07:56.240> needs<00:07:56.289> so<00:07:57.289> hope<00:07:57.589> that<00:07:57.649> helps
