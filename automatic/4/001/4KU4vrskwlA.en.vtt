 Hello everyone and welcome back for a new one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.250
 video here in our apple coffee today 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.500
 we want to answer to another of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 your requests and if you have any 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.900
 do not hesitate to make them or in ours 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.269
 youtube channel apple coffee official in i 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 various comments under our videos or in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.490
 various comments in the various posts of ours 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
 apple blog puntonet coffee or on 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
 our apple coffee facebook page 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.230
 the question is how can i go about having 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 a minimum guarantee of continuity 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 of the duration of my battery too 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 when I'm traveling and I don't have the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 possibility to connect a power supply 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 in an electrical outlet 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 the answer for that would be easy 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.260
 buy an external battery one 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 portable battery there are so many in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 around a little, though, because there are so many 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.620
 around is also very easy to take 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 a few rip-offs and for this reason 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.119
 unfortunately for my pockets found 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.820
 many before you can make this video e 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 in the end also thanks to an offer 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.869
 very interesting that is on the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 amazon.it portal I found peace with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 I will show you this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 look at it is very thin and very light it is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 an external battery not only for iphone 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
 but also for many others 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.030
 devices that can be recharged 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 via USB socket and has a power of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.189
 3,600 but I like so much to say how to say 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 some power no.ma h the value i 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.970
 I say so because for me in the end 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 a dogma 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 however it is to the power we say of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.369
 almost three times the battery of a one 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.409
 with 6 that however already quite a lot 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.000
 compared to others and the nice thing is that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.350
 don't take anybody else with you 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.260
 for example because now that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.420
 comparison with the with 6 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 here is this is with 6 this is the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 external battery that much less 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.740
 wide of the iPhone 6 and in any case 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.190
 lightest lighter than the iphone 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.140
 see and don't worry it's not that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.540
 you have to attack reform like this 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.700
 simply when the iPhone does 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.140
 download because maybe you're doing a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.690
 long journey you don't have but the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.620
 need to recharge them you need 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.790
 a lot then what you can do is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.880
 connect this battery 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.520
 if you have previously uploaded it from 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.100
 electrical outlet with normal cable 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.910
 of the iPhone or even a compatible one like 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.400
 this 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.060
 allison himself then raised 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.440
 etc 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 then the usual end that you put 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.600
 of the entry of colleagues in the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.190
 the moment you connect see the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.560
 battery is charging 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.660
 now until the battery stays in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.850
 charge then must end 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.980
 the complete recharge operation of the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.140
 iphone battery that currently at 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.570
 77 percent 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.110
 this led you see this white veil 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.030
 dot my finger in that one above 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.880
 remains illuminated after when 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.950
 the infinite recharge operation yes 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.470
 then automatically turns off the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.870
 battery is no longer active 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.180
 the battery was no longer operational 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.130
 and then the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.200
 advice is that even if it does not come 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.970
 used the battery completely for 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.030
 to be able to top up completely 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.140
 the iphone when you finish a charge 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.230
 however, as soon as possible to reconnect 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.230
 the external battery to re-supply it 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.730
 from an electrical source so take 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.280
 the cable in this case wants to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.870
 equipment in this package 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.530
 battery to whom or to how we should ok 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.800
 pronounce it in Italian and connect it 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.050
 here from the waiting microsd this time not from 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.260
 normal usb that we used before for 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.350
 recharge the iPhone and then connect it or 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.510
 to the computer with a USB socket or with 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.760
 a feeder like that too 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.340
 the iPhone's connected to the socket by 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.230
 wall to the wall socket and so 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.700
 in short, you make sure you have some 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.240
 stockpile charge can you 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.640
 also use a trip to the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.860
 pack the nice thing is that there is 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.880
 also a battery case 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.680
 so you can bring it yourself 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.750
 around in the bag so that you 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.880
 dates that are ruined that it goes to 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.550
 contact with liquids etc. and then there is 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.580
 this thing pretty much me me 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.830
 I was expecting it with these suckers 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.770
 stick to hold I guess 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.470
 the iphone while it is in charge with the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.840
 battery are therefore suction cups 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.970
 you will see rubber sticking on 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.970
 shelves on smooth surfaces 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.320
 the important thing is that in this 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.810
 moment this battery is on offer 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.050
