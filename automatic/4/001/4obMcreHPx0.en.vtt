so now let's move on to the sounds or
the<00:01:44.800> car<00:01:45.010> sounds<00:01:45.430> like

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.969 

now<00:02:08.210> for<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.540> final<00:02:08.690> part<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.140> testing<00:02:09.380> we're

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
now for the final part of testing we're

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.130 
now for the final part of testing we're
going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.250> find<00:02:10.460> out<00:02:10.580> how<00:02:10.729> quickly<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.330> canis

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
going to find out how quickly this canis

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.310 
going to find out how quickly this canis
Mesa<00:02:12.680> also<00:02:13.490> known<00:02:13.640> as<00:02:13.790> Jeep<00:02:14.090> climbs<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:15.020> Mount

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
Mesa also known as Jeep climbs up Mount

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.560 
Mesa also known as Jeep climbs up Mount
chiliad<00:02:15.530> let's<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.490> how<00:02:16.640> quickly<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.240> do<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
chiliad let's see how quickly can do it

00:02:17.570 --> 00:04:59.689 
chiliad let's see how quickly can do it
so<00:02:18.100> yeah<00:02:19.100> let's<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.240> it

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:23.110 

you<00:05:00.699> gotta<00:05:00.909> watch<00:05:01.149> out<00:05:01.449> for

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.719 

you

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.060 

and<00:05:26.729> there<00:05:27.210> we<00:05:27.330> go<00:05:27.479> so<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.990> canis<00:05:28.320> Mesa<00:05:28.740> also

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
and there we go so the canis Mesa also

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.430 
and there we go so the canis Mesa also
known<00:05:29.220> as<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.370> jeep<00:05:29.669> came<00:05:30.419> up<00:05:30.660> Mount<00:05:30.930> Juliet<00:05:31.139> in

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
known as a jeep came up Mount Juliet in

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.620 
known as a jeep came up Mount Juliet in
three<00:05:31.710> minutes<00:05:31.889> and<00:05:32.190> six<00:05:32.520> seconds<00:05:32.970> which<00:05:33.600> is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
three minutes and six seconds which is

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.159 
three minutes and six seconds which is
quite<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.530> bit<00:05:35.280> behind<00:05:35.550> -<00:05:36.449> from<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.930> other

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
quite a bit behind - from the other

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.890 
quite a bit behind - from the other
pickup<00:05:37.770> trucks<00:05:38.039> that<00:05:38.250> we<00:05:38.370> had<00:05:38.580> now<00:05:39.120> keep<00:05:39.750> in

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
pickup trucks that we had now keep in

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.779 
pickup trucks that we had now keep in
mind<00:05:39.930> this<00:05:40.259> one<00:05:40.500> has<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.710> smaller<00:05:41.100> engine<00:05:41.580> and

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
mind this one has a smaller engine and

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.210 
mind this one has a smaller engine and
overall<00:05:42.449> is<00:05:42.630> quite<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.870> bit<00:05:43.110> smaller<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.680> it

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
overall is quite a bit smaller so it

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.140 
overall is quite a bit smaller so it
wasn't<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:44.639> fast

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
wasn't that fast

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.320 
wasn't that fast
therefore<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.810> handling<00:05:46.199> score<00:05:46.710> will<00:05:46.949> be

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
therefore the handling score will be

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.969 
therefore the handling score will be
nine<00:05:48.330> out<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.570> ten<00:05:48.900> as<00:05:49.080> he<00:05:49.259> could<00:05:49.440> handle<00:05:49.620> very

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
nine out of ten as he could handle very

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.879 
nine out of ten as he could handle very
well<00:05:50.070> although<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.180> speed<00:05:51.389> will<00:05:51.750> be<00:05:52.259> given<00:05:52.710> a

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
well although the speed will be given a

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.580 
well although the speed will be given a
seven<00:05:53.639> out<00:05:53.820> of<00:05:53.850> ten<00:05:54.000> as<00:05:54.389> it<00:05:54.840> wasn't<00:05:55.169> very<00:05:55.320> fast

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
seven out of ten as it wasn't very fast

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.010 
seven out of ten as it wasn't very fast
at<00:05:55.830> some<00:05:56.009> points<00:05:56.400> in<00:05:56.699> traction<00:05:57.090> will<00:05:57.690> receive

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
at some points in traction will receive

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.830 
at some points in traction will receive
an<00:05:58.229> eight<00:05:58.560> out<00:05:58.919> of<00:05:59.039> ten<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.840> therefore

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
an eight out of ten and therefore

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.969 
an eight out of ten and therefore
overall<00:06:01.440> scoring<00:06:02.310> eight<00:06:03.000> out<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.360> ten<00:06:03.979> score

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
overall scoring eight out of ten score

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.770 
overall scoring eight out of ten score
