00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.529
 now the art world be good them 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.930
 I bring a trick in the drone map of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.200
 multiplayer mode of black ops 2 les 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.370
 I bring a trick out of the drone map 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080
 as I said 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.810
 with the help package streak so 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 proceed to the trick here we see that what 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.000
 what we have to do is throw a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.829
 package there we see that we have thrown it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.110
 fatal although good the one thrown by ok but 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.759
 the truth is that it has been able to come out to me 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.619
 that is, he was really doing the 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.790
 trick he was in the corner and in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 it has truly brought me out that I was 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.450
 trying to push it and we see that the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.910
 repeat that like me in the corner and 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250
 we see that I am pushing and I get out 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 On one side of the map, that is, I stayed 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.970
 flipping is worth but good that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 thank him because thanks to him I could 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.980
 do the trick and noel and the truth is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 that good in the ups tricks but the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 It really helps me a lot to do 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 this because the truth is that I do not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 I was doing the trick myself 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 said it was there editing I started to say 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.250
 good and I'll push see what it's 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 something good to get out of here that what 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 we have to do what we have to do 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410
 to do is to go 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.930
 around the corner is here and I'm 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.340
 thinking I say it after so much giving 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.290
 laps that I fell down the map 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.300
 politician let's go around here we see that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 it's not patched we put a little jump in 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.990
 the corner to be able to go up later to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.790
 see what I do here at the moment I try and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.050
 when you look you can go up here and 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.070
 then we can continue for this 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.200
 blue line sorry blue I'm at the tonic 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.759
 yellow and black and there we see that what 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.490
 I have to do it is a jump you see that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.440
 we have crossed the fence that and we see 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.100
 that we are completely out of the map 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.509
 if we see that I tell a few to go all over the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.130
 map and we see that it is not apart from 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.860
 person I could not go that I 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.250
 I could fall over there I do not know and live watch 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.050
 and the water is not all very handsome and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.310
 as many people tell me that the maps 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.369
 They are charged more for outside than for 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.500
 inside alexis they have almost all the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.640
 why is it worth it is map inside 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 on average is cured what happens that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.479
 this here is redundant because we see that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.270
 we can be firing there to see if 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.039
 this real ground and we see around here 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.120
 we see that we can go through the 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.030
 houses are you pretty 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.700
 fun and funny because I thought 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 that can raise the houses but although not 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.210
 the truth is not bad, because yes 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.120
 practically all the sites upload 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.680
 in the castles and the truth is that I 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.690
 he liked it a lot this is the map that more 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.400
 I liked to leave, it's worth it, it has not 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.020
 I left all but it came out of some 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.660
 and the truth that this is the most handsome 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.390
 for me and we see that we can go around to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.490
 I'm going after going through here without 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
 no problem the truth is that that 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.880
 huge the map on the outside because it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.750
 can go anywhere what you 're going 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.190
 that some sites that are 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
 parked you have to be careful to put 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.670
 an insertion outside the map as the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.990
 seen at the beginning they are 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.670
 stained and vico abounds a barrier 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.240
 invisible I have to go around 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.950
 here and we can enter the map to enter 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.630
 we can stay in a hiding place fell 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.400
 and we'll see that he jumps down 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.780
 there we see that you can go beyond 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.700
 stones and coming to look at a patch 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.620
 meters high and there we see that we can 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.450
 stay here and we're out of map what 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.220
 what happens we can shoot from there 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.650
 what happens is that this change is 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.070
 impossible because this trick is super 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.960
 difficult for you to leave we go the two 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.970
 we would be testing it for a week 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.720
 and I accidentally start pushing and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.810
 it came out 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.020
 let's be amazed because not everything 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.520
 the world is lying trying 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.290
 very much very much 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.550
 we know what drawings I'm going to drop another 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.530
 time to the map but you can not fall 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.690
 because it's completely impossible there 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.330
 to kill yourself to fall into the map 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.330
 again and we see that he is 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:42.849
 the tunnel is the name of the insertion 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.920
 put in the beginning I say good then 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.390
 if there is no need to return we see that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.420
 we can do a kinematics you see that 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.090
 I'm shooting and you can not see anything is your 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.250
 dark you can catch the ips take away the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.959
 very funny black background has been the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.000
 You can really get up here without 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.310
 problem do not slip or anything go 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.860
 Once this map has been passed on the outside, it has 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.819
 I loved the truth is that I spend 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.000
 very well everyone has put on 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.400
 viewer to see it and it has been brutal and 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.700
 without a map we see that it is perfect for 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 camp 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.980
 and we see that I have returned to the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.870
 principle that we see that this is the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.760
 cinematic that I liked the most 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.550
 water what happens that union is for 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.110
 down you die you fall down and go 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.040
 falling down down here 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.470
 a patch kills you 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.780
 we have to go to the end and 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.690
 we see that the water goes on and on and on and on 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.940
 there it stays we are going to incredible that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.250
 they had done that was the water arrives 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.920
 up there and the blow disappears as if 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.350
 there was an invisible waterfall and this is 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.050
 my house if my house how beautiful is that 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.140
 pretty 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.930
 to finish we see that we are going to finish it 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.590
 consuming ourselves in him in him 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.940
 the truck is red that can not be 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.940
 do anything you can put me on the map or 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.880
 nothing and being able to jump in there that there is in 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.980
 the tubes those and so good then in 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.050
 the channels of the players the 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.570
 you will have in the description of this video 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.950
 worth of those who have been participating 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.860
 collaborating in this video which they have 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.720
 participated are borok will fox and clover 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.240
 it's worth the one that has thrown away the package 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.740
 placed has been good okay and so 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.000
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.160
 video do not forget to leave your comment 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.990

 here he gave a greeting and until next time
