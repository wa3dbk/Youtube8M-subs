you could actually see the license tag
the<00:07:16.100> top<00:07:16.370> number<00:07:16.550> so<00:07:16.880> you<00:07:16.940> could<00:07:17.240> not<00:07:17.450> call<00:07:17.720> it

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
the top number so you could not call it

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.300 
the top number so you could not call it
