00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
don't like about this game is that I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.390 
don't like about this game is that I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
don't know how to pronounce this and I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.910 
don't know how to pronounce this and I
looked<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.820> up<00:03:05.910> online<00:03:06.150> now<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:07.200> part<00:03:07.800> Italian

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
looked it up online now I'm part Italian

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.540 
looked it up online now I'm part Italian
and<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> feel<00:03:09.120> even<00:03:09.330> more<00:03:10.370> embarrassed<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
and so I feel even more embarrassed and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.950 
and so I feel even more embarrassed and
ashamed<00:03:11.670> by<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.240> fact<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.690> don't<00:03:12.900> know

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
ashamed by the fact that I don't know

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.350 
ashamed by the fact that I don't know
how<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.170> pronounce<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.620> game<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.940> and

how to pronounce this game and and

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.700 
how to pronounce this game and and
that's<00:03:15.480> probably<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:16.020> of<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.200> shortcomings

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
that's probably one of the shortcomings

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.420 
that's probably one of the shortcomings
why<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.640> game<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.680> has<00:03:19.680> not<00:03:19.890> taken<00:03:20.130> off

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
why this game is not has not taken off

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.480 
why this game is not has not taken off
more<00:03:20.850> than<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.690> should<00:03:21.960> have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
more than it and then it should have

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.160 
more than it and then it should have
unfortunately<00:03:23.490> I<00:03:23.580> think<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.210> nobody

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
unfortunately I think because nobody

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.450 
automatically throw this order card down
and<00:05:16.180> get<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.780> points<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.130> there's<00:05:18.280> all

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
and get the points and so there's all

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.000 
and get the points and so there's all
these<00:05:18.640> little<00:05:18.700> things<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.470> that

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
one of the joys of this game that I

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.000 
one of the joys of this game that I
found<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.140> it's<00:05:32.590> it's<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.550> very

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
found is that it's it's a very

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.040 
found is that it's it's a very
unassuming<00:05:36.010> looking<00:05:36.970> game<00:05:37.240> it's<00:05:37.660> it's<00:05:37.930> just

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
unassuming looking game it's it's just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.320 
unassuming looking game it's it's just
it's<00:05:38.440> easy<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:39.070> teach<00:05:39.340> it's<00:05:39.610> easy<00:05:40.180> to

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
it's easy to teach it's easy to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.700 
it's easy to teach it's easy to
understand<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:40.810> there<00:05:40.990> is<00:05:41.080> replayability

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
understand and there is replayability

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.520 
understand and there is replayability
here<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:42.550> fantastic<00:05:43.180> i<00:05:43.930> love<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.500> fact

here that is fantastic i love the fact

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.010 
here that is fantastic i love the fact
that<00:05:44.830> these<00:05:45.070> cubes<00:05:45.850> these<00:05:46.120> produce<00:05:46.390> cubes<00:05:46.870> are

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
that these cubes these produce cubes are

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.410 
that these cubes these produce cubes are
set<00:05:47.290> up<00:05:47.440> however<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.550> want<00:05:48.820> each<00:05:49.120> time<00:05:49.360> you

set up however you want each time you
play<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.380> purple<00:05:50.740> can<00:05:50.860> be<00:05:50.950> next<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.250> the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
play that the purple can be next to the

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.280 
play that the purple can be next to the
red<00:05:51.550> or<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.120> white<00:05:52.360> can<00:05:52.630> be<00:05:52.720> here<00:05:52.870> it<00:05:53.140> doesn't

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
red or the white can be here it doesn't

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.020 
red or the white can be here it doesn't
matter<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:53.830> just<00:05:53.890> set<00:05:54.190> it<00:05:54.220> up<00:05:54.400> randomly<00:05:54.790> and

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
matter you just set it up randomly and

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.410 
matter you just set it up randomly and
then<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:56.020> cue<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.370> dice<00:05:57.610> that<00:05:57.910> represent

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
then the cue the the dice that represent

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.270 
then the cue the the dice that represent
the<00:05:58.510> price<00:05:58.900> at<00:05:59.080> which<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.530> produce<00:05:59.830> is<00:06:00.100> being

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
the price at which that produce is being

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.350 
the price at which that produce is being
so<00:06:00.490> being<00:06:01.210> bought<00:06:01.600> at<00:06:01.870> that<00:06:02.620> market<00:06:03.460> the

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
so being bought at that market the

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.780 
so being bought at that market the
randomization<00:06:05.290> there<00:06:05.470> means<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:06.040> that<00:06:06.580> this

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
randomization there means that that this

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.610 
randomization there means that that this
game<00:06:07.000> plays<00:06:07.330> out<00:06:07.480> differently<00:06:07.900> every<00:06:08.110> single

really<00:06:23.740> think<00:06:23.980> that<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:25.150> basics<00:06:25.720> can<00:06:25.930> be

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
really think that the basics can be

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.320 
really think that the basics can be
understood<00:06:26.320> by<00:06:26.950> a<00:06:26.980> much<00:06:27.430> younger<00:06:27.460> audience

understood by a much younger audience

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.720 
understood by a much younger audience
than<00:06:28.570> that<00:06:28.780> and<00:06:29.110> certainly<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.460> bright

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
than that and certainly the the bright

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.910 
than that and certainly the the bright
and<00:06:31.000> colorful<00:06:31.570> graphic<00:06:32.230> design<00:06:32.530> of<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.770> game

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
and colorful graphic design of the game

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.130 
and colorful graphic design of the game
really<00:06:33.160> invites<00:06:33.670> a<00:06:33.970> younger<00:06:34.690> audience<00:06:34.720> to

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
really invites a younger audience to

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.690 
really invites a younger audience to
take<00:06:35.320> a<00:06:35.350> look<00:06:35.560> at<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.800> I<00:06:36.040> think<00:06:36.370> it's<00:06:36.490> a<00:06:36.520> great
