interesting<00:03:34.000> as<00:03:34.299> well<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:38.109> I<00:03:38.139> want<00:03:38.290> to

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
interesting as well and so I want to

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.400 
interesting as well and so I want to
expand<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.739> further<00:03:39.069> towards<00:03:40.109> India<00:03:41.109> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
expand this further towards India and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.250 
expand this further towards India and
towards<00:03:41.829> Gandhi<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.639> his<00:03:42.760> concept<00:03:43.389> of<00:03:43.540> Swaraj

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
that primitive societies cannot survive

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.730 
that primitive societies cannot survive
without<00:04:46.120> war<00:04:47.220> but<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.550> disagree<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.630> think<00:04:50.380> that

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
without war but I disagree I think that

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.440 
without war but I disagree I think that
if<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.010> yeah<00:04:51.520> we<00:04:51.670> are<00:04:51.790> animals<00:04:52.180> we<00:04:52.330> are

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
if you yeah we are animals we are

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.600 
if you yeah we are animals we are
essentially<00:04:52.840> animals<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> believe

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
essentially animals we but I believe

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.490 
essentially animals we but I believe
that<00:04:54.640> we<00:04:54.850> are<00:04:54.970> evolving<00:04:55.390> we<00:04:55.510> are<00:04:55.660> moving<00:04:56.200> past

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
that we are evolving we are moving past

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.020 
that we are evolving we are moving past
the<00:04:56.710> notion<00:04:57.040> not<00:04:57.190> only<00:04:57.370> for<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> state<00:04:57.850> and

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
the notion not only for a state and

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.390 
the notion not only for a state and
along<00:04:58.240> with<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:58.870> notion<00:04:59.680> of<00:04:59.890> a<00:04:59.980> state<00:05:00.220> but

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
along with that notion of a state but

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.830 
along with that notion of a state but
the<00:05:00.520> idea<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:00.850> we<00:05:01.060> need<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.330> aggress<00:05:01.630> on

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the idea that we need to aggress on

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.050 
the idea that we need to aggress on
individuals<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.440> we<00:05:02.770> need<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.730> try<00:05:04.030> to

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
individuals that we need to try to

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.350 
individuals that we need to try to
