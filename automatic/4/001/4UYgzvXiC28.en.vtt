00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.960
 Hello everyone here is your dad today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.650
 is about the first commissioning of the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 came to wmv 1 bluetooth wireless microphone 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 I have to deal with this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 the already needed 23 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 worried about batteries and put them now 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.489
 into the devices 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.870
 here the microphone with a light 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.700
 thumb print or I take the here 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 index finger and he is so easy 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 not you can the battery compartment 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 postpone it is secured with a 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.640
 This is yours in the plastic band 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.379
 Wildlife does not fall on the earth 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 does not recover battery insert 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 please note and battery compartment again 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.140
 shut down 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 this is already on 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 been and it is already looking for his 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.960
 towards the opposite is not 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.840
 with battery and not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 turned on the same game here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.850
 in microphone materials lay there 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 just close 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 and now I can turn it on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 the upper slide if you have the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 clings upwards as viewed above 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.619
 is happening now try the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.210
 connect both microphones and therefore 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.790
 the blue light flashes in the moment where 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.270
 Both blue lights are lit as well 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 now the microphones are connected 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.189
 I still need that to the microphone 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.380
 to try the camera 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:45.630
 the connection cable this is this one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 The microphone itself remains with me 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 Connecting cable will be with the ear of the handset 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.970
 contact and then later with 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.009
 the video recorder 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.869
 I do that after I have the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.520
 VCR shut off briefly so 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.229
 now that's what happened here 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
 part I have that just s.kabel 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 dangle 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.610
 I'll take one of my headphones now 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 out of the pack 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:21.000
 i can hear if the microphone is sending me 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.390
 Although it is assumed that was the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 Blue connection lamps also light up 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.840
 here the mono plug of the headphones of the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.049
 earphone into my ear and that 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.099
 microphone i hear it now i plug 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:47.040
 me on my t-shirt the rest of this 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.569
 Videos at least until I stop again 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.459
 I will go with this now 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.280
 talking about microphones 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.859
 to make your quality clear 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.230
 I will now make and show in 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.730
 the neighbor room run 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.950
 in between, two doors will be 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 and a wall you will see that, too 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.920
 is no problem for this microphone 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.100
 89 meters is a distance it too 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.209
 in the house I'll manage now 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 go back because the test is over if 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.989
 I'm back at the camera I will 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.450
 the camera briefly turn again so 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.579
 I can change the microphone too 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.579
 to show the end of the recording 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.530
 out of the camera here the receiver 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.849
 the receiver and the microphone and the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.760
 listener from me 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:55.799
 I remove that from the camera and switch 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.189
 the microphone so I do it with the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.919
 receiver and remove that 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.840
 connection cable so if now everything 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.060
 the sound should be optimal 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.879
 If you are outside you can 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.469
 additionally this top protection over 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.069
 The microphone hours is wrong 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.629
 direction so then around 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.190
 wind noise and pop noises 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.019
 little subdued inside the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 perhaps I've said I do 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.349
 In addition, you can try on the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.650
 side still regulate the volume like 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.419
 just that would be an attempt on the 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.070
 you provided her with the microphone 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.199
 someday your own name is yourself 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.509
 test supposed that's it I hope you 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.720
 Become a little smarter and up 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.090
 to the next video greet you dad and 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.090
 outside with still no snow
