00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.520
 ah 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
 to be the star of the attentive night 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.789
 to this video we will see how in 5 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
 Simple steps to get a smoky eye 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.059
 perfect 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.439
 We started applying black pencil 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.439
 all the contour of eyelashes 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.770
 we are blurring and we create the base in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 smoked cream 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.980
 we also mark at the bottom 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.810
 of the eye well pegadito to the eyelash 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.640
 we blur everything up and down and a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.400
 Once the pencil has faded, we turn to 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.400
 apply the eye shadows we apply the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.430
 light shade number 19 in the arch of the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.430
 eyebrow 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.770
 and now we fill the whole mobile eyelid 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.270
 with the black shadow insisting 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.610
 especially in the contour of the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.890
 eyelashes this is the area of greatest 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.260
 intensity once we reach the basin 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.050
 of the eye with the little product that already 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.850
 it remains in the brush we are blurring 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.050
 we also mark with the black shadow in 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.050
 the lower line of the eyelid 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.310
 well attached to the eyelashes 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 and to finish we apply black pencil 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.120
 inside the eye 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.280
 that now we apply double layer of 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.730
 eyelash mask we do a little bit 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 of zig zag and we comb fixed and combed 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.360
 upwards 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.820
 we apply the black pencil in all the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.820
 eyelash contour 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.229
 we blur with the shadow brush of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.270
 eyes we also mark in the part 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 inferior and we also diffuse in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.100
 bottom part and we're going to apply the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.320
 eye shadows first the most clarita 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 eyebrow and fill all the eyelid mobile 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.600
 with the black shadow we are applying to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 little touches existing at birth 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.530
 of the tabs and until you reach the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.780
 eye socket 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.000
 of the eye and we also mark in the part 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.049

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 beveled we apply black pencil inside 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.590
 of the eye 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.640

 with zigzag movements and at the same time 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 combing and to complete the look let's go
