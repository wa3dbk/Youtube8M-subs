00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:04.037
The President: Well, as some
of you aware, several weeks

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:11.845
ago we lost two of New
York's finest, Rafael Ramos

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.414
and Wenjian Liu.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.650
They were serving their
community with great honor

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.487
and dedication and courage.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.823
And all of New York grieved
and all of the

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:24.858
nation grieved.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.727
It was a reminder of the
incredibly difficult and

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.264
dangerous work that so many
of our law enforcement

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.367
officers are engaged
in every single day.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.937
I had a chance to meet the
families of officers Ramos

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:43.610
and Liu at the memorial that
we did just a few days ago.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.346
But it's important for us
not only to honor their

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.582
memory, it's also important
for us to make sure that we

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.920
do everything we can to help
ensure the safety of our

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.424
police officers when they're
in the line of duty.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.361
And this legislation --
which has been sponsored on

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:06.833
a bipartisan basis by people
like Senators Cardin and

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:12.172
Representatives Reichert
and Pascrell -- represent I

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:17.911
think the best of a
bipartisan support for

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.712
law enforcement.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.917
What this legislation is
going to do is to initiate a

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.520
Blue Alert System so that
when we know there is an

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.525
active threat against law
enforcement, that the alerts

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.296
are going out at a
comprehensive and

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.164
expeditious way.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.301
That prevents the
possibility that other

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:45.371
officers may be caught by
surprise, and it ensures

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.808
that appropriate steps can
be taken as quickly

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.210
as possible.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.746
So I want to again thank the
members of Congress who have

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.084
come together to put this
legislation in place.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:01.054
Most of all, I want to thank
the families who obviously

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.991
are still grieving from a
terrible tragedy but have

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:09.662
worked hard to make sure
that it is translated into

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.064
something concrete.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.666
And we're very
proud of them.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.302
I'm particularly proud of
the children here -- these

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:22.842
young men who, I think, are
obviously grief stricken but

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.944
we know they're going to do
a great job looking after

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.080
their mom moving forward.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.715
So with that, what I'd
like to do is sign

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.518
the legislation.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.238
Done.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.473
Thank you very
much, everybody.
