00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.630 
at the RV we can ask a ton of questions
one<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.080> being<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.890> dim<00:00:29.130> your

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
one of which being how do you dim your

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.260 
one of which being how do you dim your
compact<00:00:30.570> fluorescent<00:00:31.170> light<00:00:31.289> bulbs<00:00:31.759> for<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
compact fluorescent light bulbs for that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
compact fluorescent light bulbs for that
I<00:00:33.570> am<00:00:33.660> gonna<00:00:33.840> turn<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.140> over<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> Dan<00:00:34.739> Nunez

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I am gonna turn it over to Dan Nunez

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270 
I am gonna turn it over to Dan Nunez
with<00:00:35.700> Centauri<00:00:36.030> Sales<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.950> reason<00:00:38.190> why

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with Centauri Sales and the reason why

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
with Centauri Sales and the reason why
they<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.579> asked<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.879> question<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.480> because

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
they get asked that question is because

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
they get asked that question is because
Congress<00:00:40.230> has<00:00:40.410> outlawed<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:41.090> incandescent

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
Congress has outlawed these incandescent

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
Congress has outlawed these incandescent
lamps<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.309> everybody<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.460> scrambling<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.120> find

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
lamps so everybody is scrambling to find

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
lamps so everybody is scrambling to find
a<00:00:45.570> replacement<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.680> can't<00:00:46.890> find

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
a replacement so when they can't find

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
a replacement so when they can't find
these<00:00:47.309> anymore<00:00:47.700> they'll<00:00:48.510> find<00:00:48.809> either<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
these anymore they'll find either a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
these anymore they'll find either a
compact<00:00:49.559> fluorescent<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
compact fluorescent we're gonna find a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.790 
compact fluorescent we're gonna find a
an<00:00:51.180> LED<00:00:51.660> lamp<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.129> they're<00:00:53.699> they're

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
an LED lamp and and they're they're

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
an LED lamp and and they're they're
putting<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.640> circuit<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.149> they

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
putting them on a on a circuit that they

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.479 
putting them on a on a circuit that they
already<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.199> incandescent<00:00:59.129> dimmer

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
already have it in incandescent dimmer

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.680 
already have it in incandescent dimmer
on<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:01.199> can't<00:01:01.410> dim<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.760> lamps<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.570> an

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
on and you can't dim these lamps with an

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.140 
on and you can't dim these lamps with an
it<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.960> compatible<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.799> compare<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it not compatible not compare okay so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
it not compatible not compare okay so
what<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
what can we do well we can get one of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.250 
what can we do well we can get one of
these<00:01:08.250> CL<00:01:08.760> dimmers<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.710> from<00:01:10.710> Lutron<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
these CL dimmers this is from Lutron it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
these CL dimmers this is from Lutron it
has<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> ability<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> dim<00:01:14.520> compact

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
has the ability to dim compact

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.380 
has the ability to dim compact
fluorescent<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.200> LEDs<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.869> really

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
fluorescent or LEDs and it really

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
fluorescent or LEDs and it really
understands<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> low<00:01:22.140> end<00:01:22.350> trim<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> if

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
understands where the low end trim is if

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
understands where the low end trim is if
we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> adjust<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> trim<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.350> whatever

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we have to adjust that trim for whatever

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.800 
we have to adjust that trim for whatever
reason<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
reason it's it's it's going to all it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.480 
reason it's it's it's going to all it's
going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> requires<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.530> little<00:01:31.920> adjustment<00:01:32.400> on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
going to requires a little adjustment on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.469 
going to requires a little adjustment on
this<00:01:32.610> dimmer<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> lamp<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:36.090> flicker

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this dimmer the lamp will flicker

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
this dimmer the lamp will flicker
it<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.280> have<00:01:38.280> dead<00:01:38.549> travel<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.329> people

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it will have dead travel and people

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.890 
it will have dead travel and people
don't<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
don't think that the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.630 
don't think that the
dimers<00:01:41.200> working<00:01:41.680> while<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:42.040> one<00:01:42.220> has<00:01:42.250> an

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
dimers working while this one has an

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640 
dimers working while this one has an
adjustable<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.990> full<00:01:44.230> range<00:01:44.470> of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
adjustable so you have full range of

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.430 
adjustable so you have full range of
dimming<00:01:44.980> it<00:01:45.100> at<00:01:45.760> all<00:01:46.030> times<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.350> the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
dimming it at all times and then the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.750 
dimming it at all times and then the
other<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.920> other<00:01:48.010> thing<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.490> need<00:01:48.640> to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
other the other thing that you need to

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.210 
other the other thing that you need to
know<00:01:48.850> about<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.600> these<00:01:50.530> lamps<00:01:50.860> don't

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
know about this is these lamps don't

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.810 
know about this is these lamps don't
always<00:01:51.850> dim<00:01:52.120> down<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.600> 1%<00:01:52.810> they<00:01:53.820> really

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
always dim down to 1% they really

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.230 
always dim down to 1% they really
struggle<00:01:55.180> with<00:01:55.330> that<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:56.550> but<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.850> does<00:01:58.060> that

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
struggle with that so but it does that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.690 
struggle with that so but it does that
full<00:01:58.480> range<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.870> dimming<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.440> ok<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.310> there<00:02:00.580> is

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
full range of dimming so ok and there is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.130 
full range of dimming so ok and there is

dimmer<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.790> reason<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.300> these<00:02:43.540> is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
dimmer the reason I like these is

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.770 
dimmer the reason I like these is
because<00:02:44.650> they<00:02:44.860> dim<00:02:45.160> down<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:46.030> about<00:02:46.480> five

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
because they dim down to about five

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.540 
because they dim down to about five
percent<00:02:47.050> versus<00:02:47.800> these<00:02:47.950> where<00:02:48.250> they<00:02:48.340> dimmed

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
percent versus these where they dimmed

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.699 
percent versus these where they dimmed
down<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.880> about<00:02:49.000> twenty<00:02:49.330> percent<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:50.560> would

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
down to about twenty percent these would

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.620 
down to about twenty percent these would
be<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> great<00:02:51.070> use<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.550> media<00:02:52.150> room<00:02:52.390> or
