out<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> hand<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> look<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.180> their

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
out of hand but have a look at their

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.749 
out of hand but have a look at their

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
tails they're not bolt upright and it's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.060 
tails they're not bolt upright and it's
because<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.240> able<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> interpret<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.380> dog's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
because I'm able to interpret the dog's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130 
because I'm able to interpret the dog's
energy<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> emotional<00:01:57.540> state<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:57.990> the

energy and emotional state from the
tails<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.159> confident<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.299> no

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
tails that I'm confident there's no

trouble<00:02:01.020> brewing<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.790> just

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
trouble brewing at all here they're just

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
trouble brewing at all here they're just
having<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> fun<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.770> all

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.840 

so<00:02:11.140> she<00:02:12.140> knows<00:02:12.350> how<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.620> tell<00:02:12.890> him<00:02:12.950> off<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.400> so

this if you see his waggy tail it's a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.610 
this if you see his waggy tail it's a
low<00:02:15.650> tail<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.450> very<00:02:17.690> low<00:02:17.960> energy<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.530> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
low tail it's a very low energy it's a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.720 
low tail it's a very low energy it's a
high<00:02:19.430> energy<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.630> not<00:02:20.840> bolt<00:02:21.080> up<00:02:21.260> ride<00:02:21.730> so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
high energy but it's not bolt up ride so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.820
