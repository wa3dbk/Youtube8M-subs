00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.179 

got<00:00:02.170> a<00:00:02.200> new<00:00:02.410> reactor<00:00:02.920> on<00:00:03.040> the<00:00:03.160> bench<00:00:03.600> 13<00:00:04.600> plates

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:05.189 
got a new reactor on the bench 13 plates

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.310 
got a new reactor on the bench 13 plates
she's<00:00:06.189> running<00:00:06.519> at<00:00:06.609> 40<00:00:06.970> amps<00:00:07.269> right<00:00:07.390> now

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
she's running at 40 amps right now

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.959 
she's running at 40 amps right now
11.7<00:00:10.320> volts

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
11.7 volts

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.350 
11.7 volts
and<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> put<00:00:13.950> up<00:00:14.039> three<00:00:14.369> litres<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> minute

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
and so put up three litres a minute

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.650 
and so put up three litres a minute
as<00:00:16.840> she<00:00:17.140> sits<00:00:17.350> right<00:00:17.620> now<00:00:17.920> and<00:00:18.330> she's<00:00:19.330> permit

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
as she sits right now and she's permit

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.300 
as she sits right now and she's permit
of<00:00:19.780> just<00:00:19.990> right<00:00:20.440> around<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.920> hundred<00:00:21.190> degrees

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
of just right around a hundred degrees

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.770 
of just right around a hundred degrees
just<00:00:21.820> over<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.110> reason<00:00:23.470> for<00:00:24.330> running<00:00:25.330> so

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
just over and the reason for running so

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.100 
just over and the reason for running so
cool<00:00:26.080> at<00:00:26.350> this<00:00:26.650> amperage<00:00:27.250> is<00:00:28.110> the

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
cool at this amperage is the

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.630 
cool at this amperage is the
modifications<00:00:30.010> that<00:00:30.190> I<00:00:30.280> made<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.760> place

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.619 

really<00:00:34.390> important<00:00:34.899> weld<00:00:35.530> on<00:00:35.739> 16<00:00:36.399> as<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.449> can

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
really important weld on 16 as you can

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.860 
really important weld on 16 as you can
see

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
see

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.689 
see
you<00:00:40.289> just<00:00:40.469> weld<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> holes<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.699> around

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
you just weld on in the holes and around

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.470 
you just weld on in the holes and around
the<00:00:44.879> holes<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.899> plates<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:47.399> also<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the holes with plates and also the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
the holes with plates and also the
opposing<00:00:49.170> side<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.790> hole<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.710> plate

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
opposing side to the hole in the plate

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.869 
opposing side to the hole in the plate
next<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.589> if<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.519> were<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.790> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
next to this one if it were in the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.220 
next to this one if it were in the
reactor<00:00:57.390> obviously

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.530 

and<00:01:00.410> like<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:00.950> said<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.220> fill<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.820> holes<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.300> and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
and like I said I fill the holes in and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.730 
and like I said I fill the holes in and
then<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.930> read<00:01:03.230> rill<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:04.489> can<00:01:04.670> read<00:01:04.850> rill

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
then I read rill and you can read rill

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.090 
then I read rill and you can read rill
to<00:01:06.740> any<00:01:06.890> size<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.430> want<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.409> they<00:01:09.409> can<00:01:09.440> modify

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
to any size you want and they can modify

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.030 
to any size you want and they can modify
it<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.900> idea<00:01:11.900> flow<00:01:12.290> just<00:01:12.619> right

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 

I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.910> really<00:01:18.090> important<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I think it's really important but this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
I think it's really important but this
is<00:01:20.100> dumb<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:20.640> mean<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> definitely

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
is dumb I mean this is definitely

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.280 
is dumb I mean this is definitely
definitely<00:01:23.650> cut<00:01:23.890> down<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.460> heat<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
definitely cut down on the heat this

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.210 
definitely cut down on the heat this
reactor<00:01:26.980> was<00:01:27.250> tested<00:01:27.810> before<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.110> glue<00:01:29.350> was

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
reactor was tested before the glue was

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.210 
reactor was tested before the glue was
applied<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:31.000> was<00:01:31.630> running<00:01:31.900> well<00:01:32.260> at<00:01:32.650> these

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
applied and was running well at these

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.560 
applied and was running well at these
amps<00:01:34.200> 160<00:01:35.200> degrees<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.910> didn't<00:01:37.180> take<00:01:37.300> long

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
amps 160 degrees and it didn't take long

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.340 
amps 160 degrees and it didn't take long
to<00:01:37.630> get<00:01:37.900> there

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
to get there

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.219 
to get there
this<00:01:39.040> reactors<00:01:39.640> been<00:01:39.850> running<00:01:40.180> all<00:01:40.600> day<00:01:40.960> on

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
this reactors been running all day on

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.600 
this reactors been running all day on
the<00:01:41.440> bench<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.590> not<00:01:44.830> much<00:01:45.070> more<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.490> a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
the bench and it's not much more of a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.490 
the bench and it's not much more of a
hotter<00:01:45.790> degrees<00:01:46.180> later<00:01:46.780> no<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.640> got

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
hotter degrees later no see I got

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.870 
hotter degrees later no see I got
a<00:01:50.530> nice<00:01:51.130> clean<00:01:51.900> electrolyte<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> couple<00:01:54.730> of

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
a nice clean electrolyte got a couple of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.860 
a nice clean electrolyte got a couple of
cuddlers<00:01:55.120> here

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.319 

gasps<00:01:58.530> comes<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.270> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> back

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
gasps comes down in the back

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.080 
gasps comes down in the back
goes<00:02:02.899> up<00:02:03.109> this<00:02:03.680> one<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> brass<00:02:04.460> stone<00:02:04.880> in

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
goes up this one with a brass stone in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.569 
goes up this one with a brass stone in
it<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.750> secondary<00:02:06.200> Butler<00:02:06.679> but<00:02:07.340> just

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
it you have a secondary Butler but just

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.240 
it you have a secondary Butler but just
a<00:02:07.700> stainless<00:02:08.149> screen<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.750> bottom<00:02:09.129> it<00:02:10.129> goes

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
a stainless screen in the bottom it goes

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.330 
a stainless screen in the bottom it goes
up<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.759> out<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.330> then<00:02:11.959> I'll<00:02:12.860> run<00:02:12.980> through

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
up and out and then I'll run through

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.940 
up and out and then I'll run through
this<00:02:13.459> filter<00:02:13.760> canister<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.599> 2<00:02:14.959> micron<00:02:15.500> filter

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
this filter canister a 2 micron filter

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.630 
this filter canister a 2 micron filter
to<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.970> some<00:02:17.180> really<00:02:17.720> dry<00:02:17.959> gas<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.489> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
to get some really dry gas and as you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.600 
to get some really dry gas and as you
can<00:02:19.819> see<00:02:20.030> there<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.569> no<00:02:20.810> steam<00:02:21.459> coming<00:02:22.459> out<00:02:22.549> of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
can see there is no steam coming out of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.740 
can see there is no steam coming out of
this<00:02:22.819> video<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> anyway<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.299> want<00:02:26.660> to
