00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 on television more also more than 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.469
 nothing means that the announcer who 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.500
 we have here in this program we the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.500
 we brought from the body house from there 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.720
 because when you're not in the program 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.920
 you are in any story you talk like 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.440
 the mayor 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:33.070
 we want to tell you right now that 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:35.020
 conductive that this action next to the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.160
 second town of walking the querendas 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 it was my fever campaign 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.680
 with the onion cambray 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:07.910
 when the program that is suffering 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.210
 what 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.210
 so it splashes you 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.400
 therefore 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.010
 I love you I love you so much 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 just a few minutes are enough 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 that the pumpkin does not turn color 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 we want about sewing because it loses all 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 the additional values although it sounds 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 stay because that sounds but not the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.530
 we want a green soup ok 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.170
 that are completely golden like this 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 as toast to be liquefied 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.320
 so that we remain this way 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.900
 look if I'm going to put to make but 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.570
 can put a little bit of chili wide or 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.420
 polvito of chile guajillo that we have 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.300
 at home for the country it's fine if 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.670
 I have a little egg already perfectly 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.710
 mixed work and I'm going to put you so much 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.380
 sara of fish that without being able to pass with 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.500
 much 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.500
 why 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.249
 I do not know anything else because I do not want to 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.329
 I really like the fish in its 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.620
 preference 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.239
 I am of opinion that we do not buy 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.560
 red snapper or stolen there are many 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.180
 fish in the market that we can 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 consume why why why not 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.019
 because if you do not see again expensive and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.810
 It is so expensive that we buy 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.130
 It is always the same fish 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.010
 there are many sought after by the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.870
 foreign is the tilapia this reason 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.360
 we have things that good also a way 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.540
 but it's worth the sierra this luxury 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.540
 ton 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.220
 for 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:56.800
 and you and I are going to bread our hand 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.950
 exactly 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.370
 we give the excesses 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.370
 the lips are bad very bad 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.420
 coriander 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.709
 to show you a little 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:37.090
 because it's a fish thing 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:40.720
 I think then chile always garlic 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:46.750
 mayonnaise and lemon exactly ok now 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.880
 we're not going to fry it in the oven 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.340
 average temperature and we're going to put it 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.570
 on an aluminum foil and let's 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.630
 have a ready-made fish like the one 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.910
 we have here in cooking shows 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.580
 always're all clean I 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.750
 I already had some fish here 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.420
 ready 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.540
 but let's put it in the oven for 8 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:11.430
 hours I already have the equipment easy 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.430
 8 minutes, either 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.130
 barely 15 minutes and the poor people 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.990

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.990
