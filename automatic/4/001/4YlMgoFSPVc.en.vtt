the cuticle area of my nail and then I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.299 
the cuticle area of my nail and then I

just happened to have some gold leaves
so<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.080> hurt<00:01:04.830> her

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so I think I hurt her

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
so I think I hurt her
nail<00:01:05.939> design<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.869> gold<00:01:07.080> part<00:01:07.350> looks<00:01:07.530> more

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
nail design the the gold part looks more

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.450 
nail design the the gold part looks more
crisp<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.700> might<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.530> some<00:01:10.530> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> gold<00:01:11.100> foil

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
crisp it might be some kind of gold foil

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.140 
crisp it might be some kind of gold foil
or<00:01:12.090> something<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.920> um<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.549> don't

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
or something like that but um I don't

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.429 
or something like that but um I don't
have<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:16.049> work<00:01:16.259> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
have that so I'm just gonna work with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.890 
have that so I'm just gonna work with
what<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> have

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
what I have

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
what I have
so<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:20.159> wait<00:01:20.340> till<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> red<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> completely

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so you wait till the red is completely

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
so you wait till the red is completely
dry<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> course<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.220> take<00:01:23.369> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
dry of course and then you can take your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.480 
dry of course and then you can take your
gold<00:01:23.670> polish<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:27.259> can<00:01:28.259> give<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> out

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.540 

yeah<00:01:35.140> you're<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.260> gonna<00:01:36.500> paint<00:01:39.550> little

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
yeah you're just gonna paint little

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.210 
yeah you're just gonna paint little
crescent<00:01:41.240> shape

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.910 

in<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.000> cuticle<00:01:50.690> area<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.470> probably

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
in the cuticle area and it probably

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.290 
in the cuticle area and it probably
easier<00:01:55.310> if<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.610> used<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:57.640> dotting<00:01:58.640> tool<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:59.180> do

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
easier if you used a dotting tool to do

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.090 
easier if you used a dotting tool to do
this<00:01:59.480> or<00:01:59.900> a<00:02:00.890> thinner<00:02:01.760> brush<00:02:02.650> so<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.710> can<00:02:03.950> be<00:02:04.070> a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
this or a thinner brush so you can be a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.160 
this or a thinner brush so you can be a
little<00:02:04.310> more<00:02:04.430> precise<00:02:04.850> but<00:02:05.720> because<00:02:06.050> I'm

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
little more precise but because I'm

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.590 
little more precise but because I'm
gonna<00:02:06.320> cover<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.710> with<00:02:06.890> goldleaf<00:02:07.460> anyway<00:02:08.300> I

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
gonna cover this with goldleaf anyway I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.800 
gonna cover this with goldleaf anyway I
don't<00:02:09.410> really<00:02:09.770> care<00:02:09.979> about<00:02:10.010> being<00:02:11.500> exact<00:02:13.810> this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
don't really care about being exact this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.580 
don't really care about being exact this
is<00:02:14.960> just<00:02:15.220> serving<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.370> base<00:02:16.580> mostly<00:02:17.590> so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
is just serving as a base mostly so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.640 
is just serving as a base mostly so
we'll<00:02:18.800> wait<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.400> dry<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.440> I'll<00:02:21.440> come

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
falls apart very easily just making a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.740 
falls apart very easily just making a
tiny<00:02:40.610> breath<00:02:40.940> makes<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.420> fly<00:02:41.660> away<00:02:42.670> okay<00:02:43.750> so

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
tiny breath makes it fly away okay so

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.450 
tiny breath makes it fly away okay so
here<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.140> got<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> small<00:02:45.740> piece<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.100> my<00:02:46.250> dotting

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
here I got a small piece on my dotting

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.860 
here I got a small piece on my dotting
tool<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.920> wanna

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.990 

use<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.650> more<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.100> bottom<00:02:57.459> side<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
use them more in the bottom side of the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
use them more in the bottom side of the
tool<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.540> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.069> smash<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.220> down<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> bit<00:03:02.040> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
tool to kind of smash it down a bit and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.360 
tool to kind of smash it down a bit and
then<00:03:04.090> you're<00:03:04.240> going<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.480> use<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.340> pointy<00:03:06.340> side

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
then you're going to use the pointy side

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.420 
then you're going to use the pointy side
to<00:03:07.030> make<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:08.230> make<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:08.740> round<00:03:08.980> or

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
to make to make it a little round or

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.839 
to make to make it a little round or
push<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.700> in

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.880 

it's<00:03:18.450> gonna<00:03:18.629> have<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> clinically<00:03:19.530> effect

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
it's gonna have a clinically effect

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.440 
it's gonna have a clinically effect
because<00:03:20.249> that's<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.549> what<00:03:20.670> gold<00:03:20.969> leaf<00:03:21.180> does

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
because that's just what gold leaf does

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.119 
because that's just what gold leaf does
and<00:03:21.719> you<00:03:21.780> mash<00:03:22.439> it<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:24.349> but<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.379> think<00:03:26.040> it

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
and you mash it down but I think it

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.989 
and you mash it down but I think it
still<00:03:26.310> looks<00:03:26.459> pretty<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:32.040> not<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.459> clean<00:03:32.849> and

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:32.999 
still looks pretty it's not as clean and

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.750 
still looks pretty it's not as clean and
crisp<00:03:33.269> looking<00:03:33.599> as<00:03:33.780> um<00:03:34.579> Samantha's<00:03:35.579> nail

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
crisp looking as um Samantha's nail

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.800 
crisp looking as um Samantha's nail
design<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:38.040> it's<00:03:38.909> still<00:03:41.540> glitzy<00:03:42.540> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
design is but it's still glitzy and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.479 
design is but it's still glitzy and
pretty<00:03:43.079> looking<00:03:43.439> this<00:03:43.980> would<00:03:44.129> be<00:03:44.250> really

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
pretty looking this would be really

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.699 
pretty looking this would be really
pretty<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:44.969> um<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:47.329> new<00:03:48.329> years<00:03:48.569> actually

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.020 

just<00:03:52.709> mash<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.040> down<00:03:53.219> a<00:03:53.400> little<00:03:53.790> like<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.450> and

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
just mash it down a little like that and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.369 
just mash it down a little like that and
I<00:03:58.849> guess<00:03:59.849> you<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.180> apply<00:04:00.419> a<00:04:00.449> topcoat<00:04:00.780> over<00:04:01.019> it

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
I guess you can apply a topcoat over it

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.390 
I guess you can apply a topcoat over it
I<00:04:01.560> I'm<00:04:02.069> gonna<00:04:02.280> try<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.760> see<00:04:04.040> what<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.159> does

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
I I'm gonna try and see what it does

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.240 
I I'm gonna try and see what it does
when<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.879> apply<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> topcoat<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.719> a<00:04:07.010> gold<00:04:08.010> leaf

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
when I apply a topcoat of a gold leaf

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.890 
when I apply a topcoat of a gold leaf
I'm<00:04:08.549> not<00:04:08.699> sure<00:04:08.909> what<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> reaction<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.689> gonna

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
I'm not sure what the reaction is gonna

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:18.289 
I'm not sure what the reaction is gonna
be<00:04:12.349> but<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.379> need<00:04:13.650> something<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:15.470> hear<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:17.299> so
