00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.319
 this time we present a new 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.990
 video tutorial that tells us how 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.990
 set up sound card 8 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.139
 channels know to be used in 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.340
 virtual dj ok one of the first things 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.980
 that we have to keep in mind is that 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.859
 we must install the driver correctly 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.689
 of the card that I suggest first 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.480
 we install the driver after we connect 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.730
 the weighing card ok then we 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.460
 we go to team I like to install 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.239
 I do not like the drivers directly 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.860
 use them the authors of these 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.200
 devices to avoid errors and or 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.480
 I prefer to select the secondary button 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 open and find my operating system in 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.050
 this case I am dealing with windows 7 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 Windows 7 selection will be covered and started 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920
 the entire installation process 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.220
 but let's run it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 when installing the driver 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.560
 automatically 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.829
 ok in my case the videos effects we 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 restart the computer you follow 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.909
 restart the computer because it is very 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.110
 likely to not restart the computer 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.360
 bring you problems in the configuration 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 I am to avoid headaches 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.340
 restart on the computer I'm not going to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 do for what I said earlier 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 although it is interesting to enroll the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.080
 software we see here in the bar 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.960
 chores 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.150
 usb multichannel audio de baix this us 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 indicates that the driver and software of the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.820
 card has been installed 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.500
 we execute this comes by default from 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.119
 this way so I had it 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.180
 installed and that's why it shows different 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.180
 comes two channels two speakers 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 if we have to configure that card 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.350
 way it will not work because we 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.569
 we need to open all the channels in 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.220
 the card to use it in the virtual 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.580
 dj is for this reason that we are going to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.920
 use 8 channels 7% 7.1 speakers 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 we accept we keep the changes we 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 let's go to virtual dj 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.800
 with our virtual day and active we go down 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.010
 to configuration 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.340
 in outputs we will select the option 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.530
 &amp; founds 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 in the card option d we are going to 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.530
 select four points 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.090
 carl that is our sound card 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.770
 multichannel it is important that this list 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.190
 Expanding probably will not appear 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.670
 as it appears on my computer this is 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.470
 because I have other sound cards 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.100
 ok no matter how it seems 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 important is that you select the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.010
 card that says usb speakers 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.950
 multichannel audio de baix that is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.989
 our sound card you know 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.140
 so that it appears to them there clear they must 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.080
 have connected the sound card to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.650
 pc after having restarted ok if you do not 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.660
 have connected will not appear 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 select the card 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.590
 with respect to the exits we leave them 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.380
 so master by the front exit and the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.030
 headphones through the rear exit if we 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.200
 we go to the physical connections to the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.490
 card we will connect the output of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.490
 audio to the public where front says ok that 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.690
 is the master and the headphones at the exit 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.250
 what the real pto says 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.310
 okay 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.540
 we apply the changes we accept and here 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.880
 we do the basic programs 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.280
 what is the basic program if we 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.040
 we have here in the middle of the two 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.120
 dishes should sound simultaneously 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.570
 when he gives play ok 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.859
 if I take the audio all to the 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.110
 side 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.229
 straight 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.939
 active this dish should not sound anything 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:34.750
 by the audio cornets the public 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:34.750
 it should only sound through the earphones 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.990
 while come select here the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.060
 press kutxa option in the case 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.889
 the opposite happens the same if you selected 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.889
 this side of press kutxa I give him play 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.969
 and I 'm going for this side I should just 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.389
 listen to the audio in the headphones with 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.649
 this we have 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.199
 completely configure our card 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:04.940
 of sounds open is a card that 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.720
 it has a quite acceptable performance 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.370
 with the virtual dj I recommend them for 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.140
 any information you can contact 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.140
 outside puntocom 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.510
