00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello guys how are people the day 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.919
 today I am very happy to greet you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.469
 and well, as you can see, I'm in the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.650
 kitchen we decided to give you some tips 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.900
 juices that are super healthy fruits 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.480
 and vegetables and I chose juices that are 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.699
 super practical to make and with fruits and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 vegetables that they find very easy in the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 super or in the itinerant markets 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 where sometimes it's like a little 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 cheaper to get fruits and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 vegetables remember that if you take these 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.190
 juices every day as they can improve 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 very much your health and good at the beginning 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.360
 the best feel a little weird with 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 these juices and if so, it's because their 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 body was very intoxicated and the juices 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.230
 they are helping you to get everything out 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.969
 this seprona and stuck in the stomach and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.340
 that bad diet that maybe they have 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.190
 carried and maybe at the beginning yes as 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 that they say to me and I am very heavy or woe 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.649
 it was the east because the truth and then 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.270
 do not worry it's a good sign because 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.030
 it means that the juices are 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.460
 helping to detoxify and good not 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 forget to buy fresh fruits and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.550
 clean them 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.830
 become infected and wash them super well 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.450
 they are called their little hands, they wash their 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.370
 fruits buy these droplets for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 disinfect and they put them there a little while 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.720
 so that it will not hurt them in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 instead of benefiting the first one that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.140
 we're going to do is going to be a juice against the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 for hair loss played against 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 hair loss 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.700
 We are going to need 6 carrots 150 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
 grams of alfalfa or spinach 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.979
 you find and it's easier to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 4 lettuce leaves get is everything 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.520
 what we need and the first thing we have 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.140
 what to do is to wash our 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.630
 spinach I already washed it super well 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 we disinfect and everything and good you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 they can also do it with alfalfa me 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.750
 I did not find but with the spinach option 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.660
 against it is pagan with spinach and let's go 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.399
 to need 4 sheets of lettuce 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.369
 we were going to make these juices in the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.660
 juice extractor but investigating us 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.179
 we realized that the juice extractor 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.200
 does not retain all the fiber that the 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.450
 fruits and vegetables 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.289
 so we recommend a lot more 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.289
 to use the liquadora 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.060
 this appointment but remember that everything is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.060
 for health 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.250
 Rich knows the truth as he knows trouble 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.170
 the 9 as pure pÃ¡lpito but no but it is 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.970
 rich is the best if they want 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 you can add a few drops 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.800
 of lemon to make a little more 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.020
 of flavor orange juice or grapefruit 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.209
 so that he is still a little bit more 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.190
 flavor but if not how can you take it 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.200
 perfectly and will help them for the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.840
 channel fall so now let's do 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.150
 a juice that is to prevent 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.670
 cramps for all these people who 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.790
 they get cramps with this little game 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.370
 can lighten very well and also this 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.530
 it makes me that is super super rich what 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.700
 only we need are two or three 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.190
 guavas and 150 grams of strawberries here already 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.200

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.920
 juices besides helping for the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.940
