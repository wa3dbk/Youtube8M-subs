00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
even then I left a little extra tab so I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.230

can fold over both just to give it some
clean<00:01:12.540> edges<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:13.680> gives<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
clean edges but it also gives it a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
clean edges but it also gives it a

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.639 
you can do this to each one of your
notebooks<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:07.539> here<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:07.869> use<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.379> stamp

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
notebooks so here I just use the stamp

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.469 
notebooks so here I just use the stamp
pad<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.069> stamped<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.489> with<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.640> letter<00:02:09.819> S<00:02:10.030> but

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
pad and I stamped it with a letter S but

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.050 
pad and I stamped it with a letter S but
you<00:02:10.690> can<00:02:10.929> obviously<00:02:11.860> spell<00:02:12.370> out<00:02:12.610> what<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you can obviously spell out what the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.449 
you can obviously spell out what the
subject<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.930> notebook<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:15.010> your

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
subject for that notebook is or your

name or whatever you'd like now moving

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.250 
name or whatever you'd like now moving
on<00:02:20.310> here's<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> very<00:02:21.819> simple<00:02:21.910> way<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.420> also

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
on here's a very simple way to also

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.100 
on here's a very simple way to also
personalize<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.400> pens<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.940> pencils<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.840> used

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
personalize your pens and pencils I used

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.979 
personalize your pens and pencils I used
to<00:02:26.230> do<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.280> paper<00:02:27.549> on<00:02:27.879> my<00:02:27.989> pencils

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
to do this with all paper on my pencils

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.500 
to do this with all paper on my pencils
but<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.040> was<00:02:30.129> really<00:02:30.549> hard<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.849> get<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.180> just

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
but that was really hard to get on just

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.860 
but that was really hard to get on just
because<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:32.019> wallpaper<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.310> sticky<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.480> I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
because that wallpaper is so sticky so I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.390 
because that wallpaper is so sticky so I
felt<00:02:35.140> with<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.379> way<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.829> just<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.250> lot

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
felt with this way it's just a lot

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.309 
felt with this way it's just a lot
easier<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.360> maneuver<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.170> work<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:41.049> here

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
easier to maneuver and work with so here

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.680 
easier to maneuver and work with so here
I<00:02:41.349> start<00:02:42.160> off<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.819> again<00:02:43.209> applying

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
I start off with just again applying

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.220 
I start off with just again applying
some<00:02:44.280> glue<00:02:45.280> stick<00:02:45.579> onto<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.900> because

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
some glue stick onto this just because

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.309 
some glue stick onto this just because
it's<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> easiest<00:02:48.040> way<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.400> work<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.319> then

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
it's the easiest way to work with then

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.289 
it's the easiest way to work with then
once<00:02:50.709> you've<00:02:50.920> got<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.220> wrapped<00:02:51.760> around<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
once you've got it wrapped around the

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.960 
once you've got it wrapped around the
pen<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:53.049> finish<00:02:53.260> off<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:54.069> little<00:02:54.579> bit

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
pen you can finish off with a little bit

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.080 
pen you can finish off with a little bit
of<00:02:55.150> glue<00:02:55.840> stick<00:02:56.170> or<00:02:56.380> more<00:02:57.220> heavy<00:02:57.459> duty<00:02:57.579> glue

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
of glue stick or more heavy duty glue

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.089 
of glue stick or more heavy duty glue
just<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.630> make<00:02:58.840> sure<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.170> those<00:02:59.380> ends<00:02:59.829> don't

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
just to make sure that those ends don't

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.180 
just to make sure that those ends don't
budge<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:01.239> for<00:03:01.510> working<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.530> wrapping

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
budge but for working it in and wrapping

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.009 
budge but for working it in and wrapping
it<00:03:03.250> around<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.549> pen<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.810> glue

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
it around the pen like this the glue

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.589 
it around the pen like this the glue
stick<00:03:05.349> works<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.889> best

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.130 

and<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:11.379> minutes<00:03:12.189> you<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.420> brand<00:03:13.750> new<00:03:13.810> pen

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
and in minutes you have a brand new pen

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.750 
and in minutes you have a brand new pen
I<00:03:16.560> struggled<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.680> lot<00:03:17.860> with<00:03:17.920> finding<00:03:18.549> like<00:03:18.730> a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
I struggled a lot with finding like a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.759 
I struggled a lot with finding like a
pen<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.659> way<00:03:19.750> wrote<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.379> you

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
pen that I like the way wrote but you

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.199 
pen that I like the way wrote but you
know<00:03:20.890> didn't<00:03:21.189> like<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> pattern<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:21.939> this<00:03:22.090> is

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
know didn't like the pattern so this is

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.860 
know didn't like the pattern so this is
a<00:03:22.269> perfect<00:03:22.659> way<00:03:23.250> then<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.519> have<00:03:24.849> some<00:03:25.269> fabric

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
a perfect way then I have some fabric

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.220 
a perfect way then I have some fabric
here<00:03:26.439> that<00:03:26.769> has<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.400> gold<00:03:27.790> leaf<00:03:28.230> elephants
