00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello everyone today for breakfast, I decided 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.280
 cook rice sweet porridge in 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.849
 I will need 3 pots 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.639
 liter of milk a little raisins sugar salt 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.850
 a little bit of butter and also 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.480
 four tablespoons of rice for each 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.410
 potty 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.660
 I will prepare rice now and I will wash it and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 I fall asleep pots and so I prepared rice 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 washed it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.600
 as well as washed winters before 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 pot all inside 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 part of the pot edge must be lubricated 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:58.859
 take a small piece of butter 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:01:01.579
 and lubricate on the inside for 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.629
 This requires quite a bit of oil and 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.810
 so you can lay out 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.960
 with the main parts of our future sweet 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.430
 rice porridge for each pot of the floor 4 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.430
 tablespoons of rice 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:26.310
 distribute a handful of raisins hd pot 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 about 3 teaspoons sugar sugar 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.460
 salt to taste of course I must think that 3 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.799
 we will be enough and under big 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.100
 a pinch of salt surely everything remains 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.210
 for and cold milk and put 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210
 languishing in convection oven 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:57.350
 but q pour 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 before the rim do not need to mix everything as 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.600
 times and a liter is enough for 3 and a pot 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.270
 moving everything inside the pot on this 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.870
 stage by the way you can try for yourself 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.000
 for sugar if not enough then add on 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.250
 my taste is excellent in convection oven 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.780
 set the grille on low legs and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.520
 put on her pot 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.520
 cover it is not necessary and 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.250
 even it will be bad for cooking as 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.860
 once pots are placed on a height 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 the convection oven remains close the lid is not 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.200
 include in the mouth and structural mode 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.290
 I expose for a maximum of 30 minutes in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.450
 time see what happens with 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.130
 pots that followed the horns 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 baby ten minutes later 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.350
 the surface is formed foam do not know 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.319
 do you see it so it all looks on 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.440
 this stage 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.070
 20 minutes left 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:17.200
 ten minutes later we see that 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:21.010
 there was such a chicken here 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.000
 porridge such a golden crust then 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.430
 there is it foam but still i'm still 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.420
 10 minutes need to drown not sounded 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.570
 treasured tink 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.450
 I disconnected the convection oven from the outlet 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.580
 but ten more minutes the pots should 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.940
 languish under the hood aerogryl 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.870
 I'm tired of waiting when I can 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.610
 try that for porridge turns out so 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.930
 method made 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.150
 and so porridge has already been born under 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:59.080
 a convection oven cover 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:05.920
 and you can finally try that 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:09.070
 whether it turned out right now 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.590
 I recognize this foam, you can remove the burnt 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.220
 I do not think that it is edible so here 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:21.250
 It looks very Akasa rice increased 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:28.150
 volume now try very interesting 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:31.240
 the taste is like porridge this porridge is delicious but 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.450
 I thought that rice should be put smaller 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.710
 although the porridge was made by prescription 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.600
 which is attached with the instruction 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.630
 very tasty porridge turned on 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.240
 a pot as you saw cooking it very 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.850
 just don't stand over the stove 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.760
 all the ingredients laid in the pot 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.180
 and literally a half an hour there 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.960
 the face turns out great porridge 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.270
 very tasty porridge I have been here 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.280
 left a little bit and and come off 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.620
 impossible how tasty she is 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.600
 it turns out such an interesting taste 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.210
 after cooking this way here 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.250
 but the main thing is its hot when cool 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.729
 already she will lose her little 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.740
 lovely 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.900
 so that he, as prepared should immediately 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.840
 I've got even some here especially 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.389
 there is the aroma of the dish baked in the pot 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.580
 apparently that's what I highly recommend 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.759
