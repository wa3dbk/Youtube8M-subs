00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
addressing these issues with such fervor

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.840

few<00:05:30.570> people<00:05:30.600> would<00:05:31.380> agree<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.850> going

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
few people would agree that just going

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.280 
few people would agree that just going
down<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.330> street<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.660> put<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.840> bullet<00:05:34.110> in

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
down the street and put a bullet in

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.800 
down the street and put a bullet in
someone's<00:05:34.410> head<00:05:34.740> randomly<00:05:35.220> is<00:05:35.520> okay<00:05:35.970> so<00:05:36.690> we

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
someone's head randomly is okay so we

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.570 
someone's head randomly is okay so we
don't<00:05:36.960> really<00:05:37.080> have<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.470> preach<00:05:37.830> about<00:05:38.040> that

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
don't really have to preach about that

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.350 
don't really have to preach about that
so<00:05:38.940> much<00:05:39.260> few<00:05:40.260> people<00:05:40.500> argue<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.550> rape<00:05:42.150> is

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
so much few people argue that rape is

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.080 
so much few people argue that rape is
ideal<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:42.960> acceptable<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.820> don't<00:05:44.940> really

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
ideal and acceptable so we don't really

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.920 
ideal and acceptable so we don't really
have<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.480> preach<00:05:45.720> about<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:46.350> but<00:05:47.100> there<00:05:47.250> are

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
have to preach about that but there are
