00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
i'm actually using the ump which really

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
i'm actually using the ump which really
isn't<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> bad<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> gun<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> thought<00:00:23.039> give<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
isn't that bad of gun I thought give it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
isn't that bad of gun I thought give it
a<00:00:23.369> try<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.939> used<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> bit<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.500> game

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a try I used it a bit when this game

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
a try I used it a bit when this game
first<00:00:25.769> came<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.699> since<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:27.869> I've

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
first came out but since then I've

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.589 
first came out but since then I've
really<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.890> even<00:00:29.310> touched<00:00:29.550> base<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.210> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
really not even touched base with it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
really not even touched base with it
since<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> main<00:00:31.619> part<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> didn't

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
since for the main part that I didn't

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
since for the main part that I didn't
really<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.140> thought<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.920> would

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
really like as much I thought it would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
really like as much I thought it would
be<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> model<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.420> ump<00:00:36.719> which

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
be more like the model for to ump which

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
be more like the model for to ump which
it<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.620> nothing<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:38.879> it's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it was nothing really like I think it's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
it was nothing really like I think it's
got<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.329> features<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.530> don't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
got some features like it but I don't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
got some features like it but I don't
know<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.309> even<00:00:41.760> near<00:00:42.090> half<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.629> good<00:00:42.809> as

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
know it's not even near half as good as

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.549 
know it's not even near half as good as
the<00:00:43.110> month<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.180> but<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:46.260> using<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the month or two one but I was using it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.549 
the month or two one but I was using it
the<00:00:46.680> wrong<00:00:46.829> way<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> gun<00:00:48.210> has<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:49.140> fair

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the wrong way now this gun has a fair

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.610 
the wrong way now this gun has a fair
amount<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.829> kick<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.899> decent<00:00:52.530> at

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
amount of kick on it and it's decent at

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
amount of kick on it and it's decent at
range<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> has<00:00:53.460> recoil<00:00:54.090> which<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.750> know

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
range but it has recoil which you know

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.279 
range but it has recoil which you know
it<00:00:55.020> shoots<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> sky<00:00:56.280> so

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
it shoots right up to the sky so

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.420 
it shoots right up to the sky so
something<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.530> careful<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.129> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
something have to be careful with is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
something have to be careful with is
that<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.850> you're<00:00:59.969> running<00:01:00.090> rapid<00:01:00.660> fire<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that if you're running rapid fire on it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
that if you're running rapid fire on it
that<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.710> cannot<00:01:02.039> hold<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> trigger

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that you cannot hold down the trigger

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
that you cannot hold down the trigger
whatsoever<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.170> long-range

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
whatsoever if it's a long-range

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.580 
whatsoever if it's a long-range
engagement<00:01:05.510> now<00:01:06.510> another<00:01:06.840> thing<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.350> I'm

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
engagement now another thing that I'm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.140 
engagement now another thing that I'm
doing<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.310> gameplay<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> don't

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
doing this gameplay that I don't

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
doing this gameplay that I don't
recommend<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.869> running<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> silencer<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.369> even

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
recommend is running a silencer now even

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
recommend is running a silencer now even
though<00:01:11.760> silences<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.450> good<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.229> you're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
though silences are good for when you're

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.719 
though silences are good for when you're
going<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.710> Moab's<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.520> recommend

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
going from Moab's i would not recommend

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.480 
going from Moab's i would not recommend
it<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> UMP<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it on the UMP it really just I'm not

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
it on the UMP it really just I'm not
sure<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.270> even<00:01:18.810> though

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
sure if it's just because even though

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
sure if it's just because even though
silencers<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.590> guess<00:01:19.770> technically<00:01:20.250> only

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
silencers I guess technically only

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
silencers I guess technically only
affect<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.060> range<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.540> feels<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> brings

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
affect a range it feels like it brings

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
affect a range it feels like it brings
down<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> damage<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> gun<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.759> know

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
down the damage on the gun I don't know

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
down the damage on the gun I don't know
why<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.439> personally<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> feel<00:01:25.770> more

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
why and personally I feel more

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590 
why and personally I feel more
comfortable<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> suppressor<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.450> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
comfortable if the suppressor is not on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
comfortable if the suppressor is not on
the<00:01:27.750> gun<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.439> heard<00:01:28.680> other

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the gun and I've actually heard other

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
the gun and I've actually heard other
people<00:01:28.979> say<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.549> same<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> don't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
people say the same thing so I don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
people say the same thing so I don't
really<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.829> UMP<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.549> suppressor

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
really think the UMP is very suppressor

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.460 
really think the UMP is very suppressor
friendly<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> find<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.320> funny

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
friendly and I find that really funny

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
friendly and I find that really funny
because<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.759> model<00:01:36.630> 42<00:01:36.810> you'd<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.130> um

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because in model 42 you'd only see um

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
because in model 42 you'd only see um
Peas<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.909> suppressors<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
Peas with suppressors pretty much and I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
Peas with suppressors pretty much and I
think<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.680> did<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.290> kind

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
think they did that because it was kind

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
think they did that because it was kind
of<00:01:43.560> called<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> Opie<00:01:44.579> weapon<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> modern

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of called like the Opie weapon of modern

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
of called like the Opie weapon of modern
warfare<00:01:45.509> 2<00:01:45.869> considering<00:01:46.409> attending<00:01:46.470> stopping

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
warfare 2 considering attending stopping

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.130 
warfare 2 considering attending stopping
power<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> suppressor<00:01:48.360> did<00:01:48.540> nothing<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
power and the suppressor did nothing to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 
power and the suppressor did nothing to
the<00:01:49.259> range<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.829> gun<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.820> they

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the range on that gun so I think they

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.510 
the range on that gun so I think they
really<00:01:51.360> nerf<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> suppressor<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> UMP<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
really nerf the suppressor on the UMP in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.899 
really nerf the suppressor on the UMP in
this<00:01:53.729> game<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.329> prove<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.659> point<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.909> guns

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
that's my whole point of this but what I

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.350 
that's my whole point of this but what I
wanted<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:38.979> actually<00:05:39.160> say<00:05:39.580> about<00:05:39.789> this<00:05:40.000> was

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
wanted to actually say about this was

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.940 
wanted to actually say about this was
the<00:05:40.570> fact<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.260> think<00:05:41.650> they're<00:05:41.800> going

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
the fact that I think they're going

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.400 
the fact that I think they're going
overboard<00:05:42.340> with<00:05:42.669> prestiging<00:05:43.660> in<00:05:43.780> general<00:05:44.229> I

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
overboard with prestiging in general I

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.050 
overboard with prestiging in general I
kind<00:05:44.860> of<00:05:44.950> liked<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.280> when<00:05:45.430> there<00:05:45.550> was<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:45.729> max

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
kind of liked it when there was a max

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.790 
kind of liked it when there was a max
prestige<00:05:46.539> and<00:05:46.810> don't<00:05:46.960> get<00:05:47.050> me<00:05:47.110> wrong<00:05:47.410> for<00:05:47.740> the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
prestige and don't get me wrong for the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.529 
prestige and don't get me wrong for the
people<00:05:47.950> who<00:05:48.099> do<00:05:48.370> like<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.700> level<00:05:49.030> up<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.330> you

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
people who do like to level up and you

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.420 
people who do like to level up and you
know<00:05:49.599> do<00:05:49.810> all<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:50.080> stuff<00:05:50.139> is<00:05:50.860> always<00:05:51.070> cool

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
know do all that stuff is always cool

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.270 
know do all that stuff is always cool
but<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.419> reset<00:05:52.840> stats<00:05:53.410> option<00:05:53.919> is<00:05:54.010> kind<00:05:54.220> of

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
but the reset stats option is kind of

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.760 
but the reset stats option is kind of
pointless<00:05:54.490> really<00:05:55.090> because<00:05:55.960> if<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.440> just<00:05:56.650> get

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
pointless really because if you just get

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.409 
pointless really because if you just get
bored<00:05:57.010> of<00:05:57.160> leveling<00:05:57.610> up<00:05:57.760> I<00:05:57.940> think<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.270> should

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
bored of leveling up I think you should

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.790 
bored of leveling up I think you should
just<00:05:58.449> be<00:05:58.660> able<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.960> reset<00:05:59.229> your<00:05:59.260> status<00:05:59.710> I

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800
