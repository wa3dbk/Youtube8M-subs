00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
to start squirreling out in the back

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
to start squirreling out in the back
really<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.620> traction<00:02:38.490> control<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:38.970> abs

together<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> hit<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> brakes

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
together and if I have to hit the brakes

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.270 
together and if I have to hit the brakes
hard<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:42.390> there's<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.260> lot<00:02:43.620> less<00:02:43.920> chance

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
hard I know there's a lot less chance

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.860 
hard I know there's a lot less chance
that<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.610> bike<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.300> slip<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.720> from

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that this bike is going to slip out from

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.390 
that this bike is going to slip out from
underneath<00:02:46.140> me<00:02:46.440> too<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.070> really<00:02:47.250> is

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
underneath me too so it really is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.240 
underneath me too so it really is
totally<00:02:47.670> confidence-inspiring

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
totally confidence-inspiring
