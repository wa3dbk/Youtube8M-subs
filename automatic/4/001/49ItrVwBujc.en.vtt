00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.270

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.980
 Galicians if I had asked for sausages 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 goods 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.950

 asked for a chupe I would have asked if 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.610
 I am Peruvian 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.650
 so if I ask for the Spanish chorizo 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.520
 because he asks me if I'm Galician because 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.520
 this is a hardware store 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.130
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.130

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.980

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.580

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.080
 [Music] 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 loose without shame should give you grief 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.409
 you have been doing in 5 hours what 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.999
 any other would have done in just one 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.999
 and what you have made me suffer 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.820
 so many nights without sleep because of you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.330
 and the sacrifices I've had that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.330
 do for you 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.470
 no this is not life is life 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.490
 You have to talk about the money you've given me 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.490
 made to spend 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.100
 Because of you, always had to take 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100
 pills 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.000
 a limit 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.910
 conklin you speak 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.460
 [Applause] 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.560
 coke and gabi 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.020
 [Music] 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.290
 and all because you are using now so many 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.590
 appointment ties 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.859
 I do not know the tie of the appointment makes me 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.760
 feel more erect more firm more 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.760
 vigorous 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.480

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.660
 you should 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.180
 I feel 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.750
 [Applause] 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.750
 [Music] 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.750
 now 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.680
 It is curro you can not imagine what has 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.320
 passed because what happened to you 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.090
 manu whatever the car and I said the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.150
 keys to mentos that you look like man 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.150
 manolo but that sometimes happens 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.750
 because thieves put a wire 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.750
 until they manage to hook the insurance that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.650
 open the door but to do that there 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.870
 have experience being an expert 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.079
 you have my wife help me to them 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.329
 car thief did not but he was guiding me 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.290
 until I get to hook the insurance and 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:46.250
 see what was guiding you and how it went 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.349
 saying to the right more work to the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.750

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.760
 sure and april is that she was of 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.800

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.800
 [Laughs] 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.780
