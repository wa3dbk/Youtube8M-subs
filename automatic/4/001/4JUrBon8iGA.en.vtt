different than Anasazi Awana that I use
the<00:03:07.170> only<00:03:07.500> problem<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.190> when<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.970> trying

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the only problem was when I was trying

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.470 
the only problem was when I was trying
to<00:03:09.300> get<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:11.190> getting<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:11.910> powdery

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to get it it was getting really powdery

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.380 
to get it it was getting really powdery
and<00:03:12.990> like<00:03:13.410> falling<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.430> my<00:03:14.550> nose<00:03:14.610> yeah<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.180> don't

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and like falling on my nose yeah I don't

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.960 
and like falling on my nose yeah I don't
like<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:17.220> way<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> fix<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
like that so one way to fix that is to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.420 
like that so one way to fix that is to
do<00:03:18.240> your<00:03:18.270> eyebrows<00:03:18.750> first<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.250> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
do your eyebrows first and then you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.190 
do your eyebrows first and then you
you'll<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.150> able<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.420> clean<00:03:21.630> off<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> residue

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
you'll be able to clean off the residue

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.930 
you'll be able to clean off the residue
but<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.800> do<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> fact<00:03:23.490> that<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.760> can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
but I do like the fact that you can

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.190 
but I do like the fact that you can
personalize<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.630> colors<00:03:24.930> because<00:03:25.140> I

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
personalize the colors because I

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720 
personalize the colors because I
actually<00:03:25.320> didn't<00:03:25.680> realize<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.610> know<00:03:26.700> how

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730
