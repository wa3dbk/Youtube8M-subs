horses<00:00:46.220> that<00:00:46.730> was<00:00:46.910> until<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:47.540> got<00:00:47.570> involved

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
horses that was until we got involved

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.399 
with Doug mill Holland in about 1978
that<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:52.760> realized<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.690> horses<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:54.260> were

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
that we realized that the horses we were

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.069 
that we realized that the horses we were
reading<00:00:54.829> were<00:00:54.949> not<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:56.269> quality<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.780> you

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
reading were not the quality that you

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.979 
reading were not the quality that you
needed<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.620> compete<00:00:58.309> with<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.780> world

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
level now anytime you got a program

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.719 
level now anytime you got a program
that's<00:01:03.559> been<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> business<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.339> long

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
them really good and eventually you'll

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.690 
them really good and eventually you'll
get<00:01:32.119> some<00:01:32.390> place<00:01:33.010> this<00:01:34.010> knowledge<00:01:34.520> and

about<00:02:07.100> him<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.880> he's<00:02:08.569> very<00:02:08.840> trainable<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
about him is he's very trainable and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.990 
about him is he's very trainable and
quiet<00:02:11.409> I've<00:02:12.409> only<00:02:12.799> been<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.129> him<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.549> couple<00:02:13.819> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
quiet I've only been on him a couple of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.860 
quiet I've only been on him a couple of
times<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.840> he<00:02:15.349> has<00:02:16.159> stayed<00:02:16.519> very<00:02:16.849> good<00:02:17.209> very

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
times and he has stayed very good very

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.149 
times and he has stayed very good very
consistent<00:02:18.590> with<00:02:19.519> Helen<00:02:19.940> riding<00:02:20.390> him<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:21.159> think

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
consistent with Helen riding him I think

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.570 
consistent with Helen riding him I think
a<00:02:22.670> lot<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.930> attributed<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.680> obviously

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
a lot of that is attributed to obviously

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.789 
a lot of that is attributed to obviously
the<00:02:25.849> horses<00:02:26.299> mind<00:02:26.659> and<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.349> Joe's

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
the horses mind and I think Joe's

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.500 
the horses mind and I think Joe's
training<00:02:28.129> program<00:02:29.319> everything<00:02:30.319> was<00:02:30.709> done<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
training program everything was done the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.170 
training program everything was done the
right<00:02:32.720> way<00:02:32.799> very<00:02:33.799> easy<00:02:34.099> for<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> non-pro<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.909> get

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
right way very easy for a non-pro to get

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.610 
right way very easy for a non-pro to get
on<00:02:35.360> go<00:02:35.689> ride<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.000> learn<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:39.349> first
