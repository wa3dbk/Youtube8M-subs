00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the blu-ray print is better than any

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990 
the blu-ray print is better than any
print<00:00:25.080> I've<00:00:25.230> ever<00:00:25.439> seen<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> film<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
print I've ever seen of the film the
process<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.900> exactly<00:00:30.439> what<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.679> filmmaker

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
process is exactly what a filmmaker

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.280 
process is exactly what a filmmaker
would<00:00:32.880> envision<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:34.110> seen<00:00:35.840> blu-ray<00:00:36.840> prints

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
would envision I've seen blu-ray prints

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
would envision I've seen blu-ray prints
of<00:00:37.469> things<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.980> Lawrence<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.610> Arabia<00:00:39.090> which

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of things like Lawrence of Arabia which

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.200 
of things like Lawrence of Arabia which
I<00:00:40.079> remember<00:00:40.559> seeing<00:00:40.860> originally<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.760> theatres

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I remember seeing originally in theatres

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.569 
I remember seeing originally in theatres
which<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> revelation<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.219> blu-ray

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
which was a revelation and on blu-ray

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
which was a revelation and on blu-ray
all<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.020> comes<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.010> more<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
all of that comes back and more and the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130 
all of that comes back and more and the
French<00:00:49.739> Connection<00:00:50.539> never<00:00:51.539> looked<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.050> good

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
French Connection never looked as good

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
French Connection never looked as good
in<00:00:52.500> theaters<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> printing

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in theaters because of the printing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
in theaters because of the printing
process<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.530> blu-ray<00:00:55.800> there's<00:00:56.309> more

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
process but with blu-ray there's more

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569 
process but with blu-ray there's more
information<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> discs<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
information put into the discs and it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.319 
information put into the discs and it
reads<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:02.340> able<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> control

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
reads more and so you're able to control

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.950 
reads more and so you're able to control
also<00:01:04.549> where<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> correct<00:01:06.330> where<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> had

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
also where and correct where you had

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
also where and correct where you had
under<00:01:07.290> exposures<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.369> over<00:01:08.790> exposures<00:01:09.450> these

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
under exposures or over exposures these

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
under exposures or over exposures these
are<00:01:10.409> easily<00:01:10.860> corrected<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> digital

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
are easily corrected in the digital

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
are easily corrected in the digital
process<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> detail<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:16.500> alive

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
process and the detail is more alive

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.719

than any print I've ever seen on film

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.749 
than any print I've ever seen on film
it's<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.570> alive<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.049> blu-ray<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.280> I'm

but<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.489> birthday<00:02:14.909> party<00:02:15.329> and<00:02:15.569> bug<00:02:15.959> had<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
but the birthday party and bug had a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.339 
but the birthday party and bug had a
very<00:02:16.829> deep<00:02:17.549> effect<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.269> me<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.720> saw<00:02:19.110> them

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
very deep effect on me when I saw them

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.920 
very deep effect on me when I saw them
and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.590> thought<00:02:19.799> they<00:02:19.860> were<00:02:20.040> cinematic<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.569> of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and I thought they were cinematic and of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110 
and I thought they were cinematic and of
course<00:02:22.260> very<00:02:22.590> difficult<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.489> made<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
course very difficult to get made you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.990 
course very difficult to get made you
know<00:02:24.269> because<00:02:24.750> first<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.400> originate

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
know because first of all they originate

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.259 
know because first of all they originate
in<00:02:27.239> another<00:02:27.569> medium<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.579> that<00:02:29.579> medium<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
in another medium and that medium is

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.410 
in another medium and that medium is
thought<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.900> less<00:02:31.700> cinematic<00:02:32.730> than<00:02:33.060> pure

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
thought to be less cinematic than pure

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
thought to be less cinematic than pure
cinema<00:02:33.870> something<00:02:34.769> like<00:02:34.950> French<00:02:35.310> Connection

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
cinema something like French Connection

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.729 
cinema something like French Connection
for<00:02:36.120> example<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:38.459> moved<00:02:39.329> as<00:02:39.659> deeply<00:02:40.079> by

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
for example but I'm moved as deeply by

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.069 
for example but I'm moved as deeply by
those<00:02:41.010> works<00:02:41.579> as<00:02:41.909> I<00:02:41.939> am<00:02:42.239> by<00:02:42.420> anything<00:02:42.900> else

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840

when you were interviewing him did you

but<00:03:17.459> from<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.730> different<00:03:18.090> era<00:03:18.540> almost<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
but from a different era almost like a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.939 
but from a different era almost like a
mirror<00:03:19.560> image<00:03:20.030> that's<00:03:21.030> interesting<00:03:21.769> in<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.919> way

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
mirror image that's interesting in a way

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:29.180 
mirror image that's interesting in a way
I<00:03:24.169> did<00:03:25.730> but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.060> found<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.019> his<00:03:28.319> opinions<00:03:28.980> of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
I did but I found that his opinions of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.729 
I did but I found that his opinions of
his<00:03:29.340> own<00:03:29.519> work<00:03:29.879> differed<00:03:30.840> from<00:03:30.870> mine

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
his own work differed from mine

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.770 
his own work differed from mine
he<00:03:32.400> had<00:03:32.959> no<00:03:33.959> value<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:35.400> his<00:03:35.549> earliest<00:03:36.299> and

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
he had no value for his earliest and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.399 
he had no value for his earliest and
most<00:03:36.810> important<00:03:37.590> works<00:03:37.970> metropolis<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.239> M<00:03:39.599> he

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
most important works metropolis and M he

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.069 
most important works metropolis and M he
thought<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.889> were<00:03:40.949> he<00:03:41.609> said

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
thought they were he said

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.610 
thought they were he said
sophomoric<00:03:43.079> was<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.040> phrase<00:03:44.340> he<00:03:44.639> used<00:03:44.940> and

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
sophomoric was the phrase he used and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.710 
sophomoric was the phrase he used and
that's<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.889> think<00:03:46.919> because<00:03:47.549> those<00:03:48.090> films<00:03:48.510> got

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's I think because those films got

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.649 
that's I think because those films got
taken<00:03:49.379> away<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.739> him<00:03:50.250> by<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.549> producers<00:03:51.389> or

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
taken away from him by the producers or

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.559 
taken away from him by the producers or
by<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> studios<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.769> re-edited<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.699> now<00:03:54.299> as

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
by the studios and re-edited and now as

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.659 
by the studios and re-edited and now as
you<00:03:54.720> may<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.139> they<00:03:55.379> found<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.979> lot<00:03:56.129> of<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.400> cut

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
you may know they found a lot of the cut

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.349 
you may know they found a lot of the cut
footage<00:03:57.000> from<00:03:57.329> metropolis<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.979> nudie<00:03:59.879> new

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.259 
footage from metropolis and a nudie new
I<00:04:00.720> think<00:04:01.229> blu-ray<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.310> coming<00:04:02.879> out<00:04:03.030> of

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
I think blu-ray is coming out of

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.909 
I think blu-ray is coming out of
metropolis<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.840> felt<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.900> Lang<00:04:07.290> was<00:04:07.650> too

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
metropolis and I felt that Lang was too

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.569 
metropolis and I felt that Lang was too
harsh<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.639> his<00:04:08.819> own<00:04:09.060> career<00:04:10.040> more<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.250> than<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
harsh on his own career more so than I

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.869 
harsh on his own career more so than I
was<00:04:11.849> because<00:04:12.269> Lang<00:04:13.079> was<00:04:13.790> certainly<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
was because Lang was certainly a

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.529 
was because Lang was certainly a
profound<00:04:15.419> influence<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:16.349> me<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.889> every<00:04:17.130> other

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
profound influence on me and every other

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.289 
profound influence on me and every other
filmmaker<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.690> my<00:04:19.019> generation<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.820> yes<00:04:21.060> he

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
filmmaker of my generation but yes he

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.060 
filmmaker of my generation but yes he
had<00:04:21.389> a<00:04:21.419> lot<00:04:21.599> of<00:04:21.750> trouble<00:04:22.109> with<00:04:22.229> studios<00:04:22.740> as

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
had a lot of trouble with studios as

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820 
had a lot of trouble with studios as
well<00:04:23.310> he<00:04:24.270> was<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.479> cantankerous<00:04:25.110> guy

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
well he was a cantankerous guy

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.189 
well he was a cantankerous guy
like<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.069> think<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.460> I'm<00:04:27.669> not<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.900> don't
