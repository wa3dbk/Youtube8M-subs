00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800
 Paper rabbit lope 

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:15.200
 mobile game 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.133
 it is good! 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.000
 Good 

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:10.800
 Come 

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.633
 No... 

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.400
 Oops... good luck 

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.200
 Oh 

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.200
 I should be able to play this time. 

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.500
 it should be OK 

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.133
 Very easy 

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.200
 Hey! Got again 

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.500
 Flashing off... not good 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.100
 Oh 

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:31.466
 Oops 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.866
 Can't hold on 

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.566
 Calm and cheer 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.366
 Here... fast 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.200
 coming 

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:42.933
 unfortunately 

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.466
 Really annoying 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.233
 Also stuck in the same place 

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.133
 correct 

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.066
 right 

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:52.433
 Just this street signal light 

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.433
 The last "drip drips" 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.666
 People feel that this is a hot heart 

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.133
 Anxious 

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.933
 Are urged by it 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.133
 It’s better to cross the road first. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.766
 It’s too much trouble to cross the road. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.566
 Really 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 The protagonist of this game 

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.033
 It’s a bit like you. 

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.566
 It seems a bit 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.133
 So every time I lose, I feel a little overwhelmed. 

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.400
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.100
 Looked out? 

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.966
 Go to the movies. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.133
 Play again and go play? 

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.000
 Ok 

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:40.833
 what 

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.800
 I must score the highest score. 

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:46.533
 Look 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.600
 it is good 

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.033
 This is a good fight 

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:50.966
 Oh 

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:52.400
 Come 

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:55.666
 well 

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.533
 Good 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600
 calm 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.600
 Optimistic 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.133
 Ah... bad. 

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.233
 Come here. 

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.000
 Finished 

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.433
 It’s the “drip” sound of this signal light. 

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.233
 Then cross the road first. 

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.633
 The movie theater is not here. 

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.900
 what? 

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.166
 Go away 

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.466
 Why are you so long at this station? 

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:33.833
 To be continued 

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:30.933
 Walk away 

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:31.933
 Really...
