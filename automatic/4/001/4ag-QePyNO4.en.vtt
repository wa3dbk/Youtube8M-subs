and also the car fits our criteria what
we<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> work<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
we like to work on so

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.250 
we like to work on so
don't<00:01:53.760> have<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.660> your<00:01:55.050> car

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
don't have a go at it for you your car

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.110 
don't have a go at it for you your car
is<00:01:55.290> sitting<00:01:55.620> at<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.100> crossover<00:01:56.550> point<00:01:56.910> right

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
is sitting at that crossover point right

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.300 
is sitting at that crossover point right
now<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.960> still<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> road<00:01:58.620> car<00:01:58.950> well<00:01:59.220> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now so it's still a road car well it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.680 
now so it's still a road car well it's
not<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> road<00:01:59.730> car<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.150> road<00:02:00.360> cut

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
not a road car it's a road cut

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.380 
not a road car it's a road cut
orientated<00:02:01.380> sort<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.650> thing<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:03.180> very

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
orientated sort of thing so it's very

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.540 
orientated sort of thing so it's very
basic<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.200> setup<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.430> now

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
basic and it's setup but you're now

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.490 
basic and it's setup but you're now
looking<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.600> next<00:02:06.870> sort<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.200> level

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
looking to go to that next sort of level

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
looking to go to that next sort of level
so<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.009> look<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.280> things<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.670> sway<00:02:09.119> bar

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so we look at things like sway bar

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
so we look at things like sway bar
positioning<00:02:10.100> suspension<00:02:11.100> geometry<00:02:11.250> you've

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
positioning suspension geometry you've

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
positioning suspension geometry you've
done<00:02:12.210> all<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.570> basic<00:02:13.050> sort<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.380> setup

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
done all of your basic sort of setup

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
done all of your basic sort of setup
things<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.490> actually<00:02:14.760> need<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.210> pull

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
things now we actually need to pull

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.570 
things now we actually need to pull
shocks<00:02:15.660> out<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.500> fake<00:02:16.740> shocks<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.460> do

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
shocks out put fake shocks in and do

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790 
shocks out put fake shocks in and do
bump<00:02:17.820> steer<00:02:18.030> adjustments<00:02:18.690> measurements<00:02:19.290> work

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
bump steer adjustments measurements work

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.040 
bump steer adjustments measurements work
out<00:02:20.040> roll<00:02:20.280> center<00:02:20.520> heights<00:02:20.850> calculations<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
out roll center heights calculations and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.800 
out roll center heights calculations and
go<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.590> next<00:02:22.980> step<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.760> cars<00:02:24.000> very<00:02:24.330> well<00:02:24.570> set

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
go that next step the cars very well set

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
go that next step the cars very well set
up<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.490> sort<00:02:26.730> of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
up for what it is but it's a sort of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
up for what it is but it's a sort of
thing<00:02:26.970> where<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.780> discussed<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
thing where like we discussed from a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.590 
thing where like we discussed from a
road<00:02:28.830> car<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> race<00:02:29.550> car<00:02:29.820> if<00:02:30.210> you're<00:02:30.450> not

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
road car to a race car if you're not

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420 
road car to a race car if you're not
worried<00:02:31.080> about<00:02:31.170> noise<00:02:31.620> vibration<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
worried about noise vibration and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.740 
worried about noise vibration and
harshness<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.120> everything<00:02:33.480> else

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
harshness and everything else

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
harshness and everything else
what<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.760> make<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.150> car<00:02:36.360> that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
what can we now do to make the car that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.720 
what can we now do to make the car that
little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.290> better<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:38.040> went<00:02:38.250> over<00:02:38.490> all<00:02:38.610> of

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
little bit better we went over all of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.100 
little bit better we went over all of
your<00:02:38.820> acumen<00:02:39.150> angles<00:02:39.750> you've<00:02:39.990> obviously

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
your acumen angles you've obviously

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.380 
your acumen angles you've obviously
calculated<00:02:40.980> roll<00:02:41.130> Centers<00:02:41.550> bump<00:02:41.880> stairs<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
calculated roll Centers bump stairs and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.360 
calculated roll Centers bump stairs and
everything<00:02:42.480> else<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.500> improvements<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.340> be

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
everything else so improvements can be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.949 
everything else so improvements can be
made<00:02:44.490> there<00:02:44.880> which<00:02:45.090> we're<00:02:45.330> looking<00:02:45.600> at<00:02:45.690> doing

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
made there which we're looking at doing

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.050 
made there which we're looking at doing
with<00:02:46.709> your<00:02:46.830> fuel<00:02:47.070> system<00:02:47.250> obviously<00:02:47.940> we've

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
with your fuel system obviously we've

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.390 
with your fuel system obviously we've
removed<00:02:48.300> your<00:02:48.660> original<00:02:49.290> fuel<00:02:49.500> tank<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:50.190> fit<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
removed your original fuel tank to fit a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.670 
removed your original fuel tank to fit a
smaller<00:02:50.730> cell<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.750> fuel<00:02:52.020> tank<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.530> in

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
smaller cell the fuel tank that was in

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.900 
smaller cell the fuel tank that was in
the<00:02:52.800> vehicle<00:02:53.010> obviously<00:02:53.459> didn't<00:02:53.700> weigh<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the vehicle obviously didn't weigh a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.060 
the vehicle obviously didn't weigh a
hell<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.330> lot<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.990> all<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> associated

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
hell of a lot but all of the associated

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.170 
hell of a lot but all of the associated
components<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.790> with<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
components that go with it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.759 
components that go with it
bracketry<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.019> boot<00:02:58.230> floor<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
bracketry in the boot floor and

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.170 
bracketry in the boot floor and
everything<00:02:58.980> else<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.459> obviously<00:02:59.850> now<00:03:00.000> being

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
everything else is obviously now being

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.449 
everything else is obviously now being
removed<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.200> that's<00:03:01.830> sort<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.130> what<00:03:02.310> we're

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
removed so that's sort of what we're

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.800 
removed so that's sort of what we're
looking<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.820> doing<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.390> car<00:03:03.570> at<00:03:03.690> this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
looking at doing with the car at this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.680 
looking at doing with the car at this
stage<00:03:04.080> also<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.459> identifying<00:03:06.000> things<00:03:06.330> that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
stage also just identifying things that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.050 
stage also just identifying things that
as<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.140> road<00:03:07.440> car<00:03:07.470> would<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.010> okay<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
as a road car would be okay but as a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.090 
as a road car would be okay but as a
race<00:03:09.300> car<00:03:09.330> do<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:10.380> need<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.739> improved

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
race car do they need to be improved

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.979 
race car do they need to be improved
you've<00:03:11.790> pretty<00:03:11.970> much<00:03:12.180> given<00:03:12.480> us<00:03:12.600> an<00:03:12.720> open

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
you've pretty much given us an open

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.050 
you've pretty much given us an open
slate<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.500> said<00:03:14.010> look<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.489> needs<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.850> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
slate and said look if it needs it I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
slate and said look if it needs it I
don't<00:03:15.660> mind<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> thing

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
don't mind so we want to see the thing

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.850 
don't mind so we want to see the thing
go<00:03:17.430> as<00:03:17.550> fast<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.510> can't<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.320> why<00:03:19.560> as

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
go as fast as it can I can't see why as

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.070 
go as fast as it can I can't see why as
an<00:03:20.070> S<00:03:20.190> chassis<00:03:20.459> vehicle<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.060> won't<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.570> 60s

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
an S chassis vehicle it won't do 60s

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.750 
an S chassis vehicle it won't do 60s
around<00:03:22.200> make<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.680> plan<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.550> it's<00:03:23.670> an

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
around make your plan I think it's an

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.400 
around make your plan I think it's an
extremely<00:03:24.150> achievable<00:03:24.780> thing<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.080> others

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
extremely achievable thing as others

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.860 
extremely achievable thing as others
have<00:03:25.709> also<00:03:25.920> started<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.580> show<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.630> want<00:03:27.810> to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
have also started to show so we want to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.410 
have also started to show so we want to
see<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.110> car<00:03:28.290> performative<00:03:28.950> potential<00:03:29.519> but

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
see the car performative potential but

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.210 
see the car performative potential but
amongst<00:03:31.110> everything<00:03:31.500> else<00:03:31.800> we<00:03:31.950> want<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> see

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
amongst everything else we want to see

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
amongst everything else we want to see
you<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.640> fun<00:03:32.820> in<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.060> car<00:03:33.269> which<00:03:33.840> is

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
you have fun in the car which is

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.800 
you have fun in the car which is
essentially<00:03:34.769> what<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:36.239> first<00:03:36.510> step

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
essentially what it is the first step

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870 
essentially what it is the first step
was<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.019> install<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.500> new<00:03:37.680> Grady<00:03:38.100> six<00:03:38.459> piston

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
was to install the new Grady six piston

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.259 
was to install the new Grady six piston
brakes<00:03:39.150> with<00:03:39.420> Alcon<00:03:40.430> 355<00:03:41.430> Mill<00:03:41.670> Road<00:03:41.850> errs<00:03:42.060> and

project<00:03:43.050> leader<00:03:43.260> pads<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.700> bolt<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:45.150> kit

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
project leader pads it's a bolt on kit

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.720 
project leader pads it's a bolt on kit
for<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.690> Sylvia<00:03:46.110> or<00:03:46.260> GTR<00:03:46.800> who<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> pretty

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
for a Sylvia or GTR who is a pretty

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.930 
for a Sylvia or GTR who is a pretty
straightforward<00:03:48.150> affair

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.390 

the<00:03:55.750> next<00:03:56.080> step<00:03:56.260> was<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.440> remove<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.980> subframe

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
the next step was to remove the subframe

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:07.980 
the next step was to remove the subframe
so<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.760> could<00:03:57.910> remove<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.420> factory<00:03:58.660> fuel<00:03:59.110> tank

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.380 

which<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.860> out<00:04:09.070> we<00:04:09.460> proceeded<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.970> cut<00:04:10.210> out

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
which that out we proceeded to cut out

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.420 
which that out we proceeded to cut out
the<00:04:10.540> booth<00:04:10.750> floor<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.350> make<00:04:11.530> room

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.860 

meanwhile<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.610> made<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.000> some<00:04:20.180> new<00:04:20.330> sway<00:04:20.630> bar

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
meanwhile I made up some new sway bar

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.110 
meanwhile I made up some new sway bar
brackets<00:04:21.320> as<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.920> link<00:04:22.160> was<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:22.640> an<00:04:22.730> angle

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
brackets as the link was on an angle

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.360 
brackets as the link was on an angle
making<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.660> sway<00:04:23.930> bar<00:04:24.200> not<00:04:24.590> work<00:04:24.800> effectively

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
making the sway bar not work effectively

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.310 
making the sway bar not work effectively
with<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:26.330> new<00:04:26.540> one<00:04:26.690> in<00:04:26.810> place

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
with the new one in place

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.560 
with the new one in place
it<00:04:27.380> means<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.010> link<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.430> always<00:04:28.670> vertical<00:04:29.420> and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
it means the link is always vertical and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.560 
it means the link is always vertical and
acting<00:04:30.050> linearly<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.920> sway<00:04:31.160> bar<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:32.240> our

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
acting linearly on the sway bar in our

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.630 
acting linearly on the sway bar in our
next<00:04:32.870> issue<00:04:33.020> we<00:04:33.620> will<00:04:33.770> be<00:04:33.890> putting<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> new

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
next issue we will be putting in the new

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.730 
next issue we will be putting in the new
fuel<00:04:35.000> cell<00:04:35.240> installing<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.140> front<00:04:36.290> part<00:04:36.650> of
