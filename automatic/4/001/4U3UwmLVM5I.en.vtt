that<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.140> reason<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.590> these<00:03:22.709> hauntings<00:03:23.220> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
that the reason for these hauntings is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.850 
that the reason for these hauntings is
because<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> rich<00:03:24.150> history<00:03:24.360> both<00:03:25.140> bad<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
because of the rich history both bad and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.600 
because of the rich history both bad and
good<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.030> mansion<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.750> shadow<00:03:28.080> wall<00:03:28.610> this

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
good of the mansion and shadow wall this

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.280 
good of the mansion and shadow wall this
place<00:03:29.880> definitely<00:03:30.060> has<00:03:30.360> history<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.140> it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
place definitely has history because it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
place definitely has history because it
is<00:03:31.320> sacred<00:03:31.560> ground<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.280> an<00:03:32.400> old<00:03:32.549> place<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.180> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
is sacred ground it is an old place so I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.759 
is sacred ground it is an old place so I
think<00:03:34.049> they<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.230> want<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> make<00:03:34.739> sure

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
think they just want to make sure

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.250 
think they just want to make sure
everything's<00:03:35.310> still<00:03:35.519> intact<00:03:35.850> like<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.239> was<00:03:36.420> in
