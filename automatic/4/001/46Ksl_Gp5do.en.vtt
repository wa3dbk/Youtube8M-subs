00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
but you know it was kind of same last

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.139 
but you know it was kind of same last
year<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.100> know<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.369> homeless<00:01:24.759> were<00:01:24.909> less

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
year to you know the homeless were less

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.940 
year to you know the homeless were less
quick<00:01:25.390> during<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.750> week<00:01:25.929> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.350> during

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
quick during the week and then during

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.770 
quick during the week and then during
the<00:01:27.100> race<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.460> really<00:01:27.700> turn<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.030> up<00:01:28.179> but<00:01:28.420> I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
the race to really turn it up but I

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.059 
the race to really turn it up but I
think<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.200> biggest<00:01:29.409> thing<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.740> just<00:01:29.770> being

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
think the biggest thing is just being

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.580 
think the biggest thing is just being
focused<00:01:30.520> on<00:01:30.640> our<00:01:30.850> program<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.469> for<00:01:32.469> sure

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
focused on our program and for sure

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
with the rain it's maybe gonna be a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.420 
with the rain it's maybe gonna be a
little<00:02:13.629> bit<00:02:13.810> slicker<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.560> i<00:02:14.920> don't<00:02:15.099> i<00:02:15.310> don't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
any if it is a little bit different

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.129 
any if it is a little bit different
everybody's<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.299> have<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.630> deal<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:19.989> it

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139

that serapha charmin racing we're not

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.440 
that serapha charmin racing we're not
too<00:02:27.370> affected<00:02:27.730> by<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.880> rain<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.329> got

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
too affected by the rain we got

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.629 
too affected by the rain we got
everything<00:02:28.840> we<00:02:28.989> needed<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.319> do<00:02:29.500> done<00:02:29.639> before

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
everything we needed to do done before

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.910 
everything we needed to do done before
it<00:02:30.730> even<00:02:30.819> showed<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.569> when<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.350> rolled<00:02:32.590> back

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
it even showed up so when we rolled back

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.770 
it even showed up so when we rolled back
it<00:02:33.250> was<00:02:33.370> about<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.790> rain<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.540> when<00:02:34.690> we

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
it was about to rain and that's when we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.940 
it was about to rain and that's when we
were<00:02:34.900> done<00:02:35.049> we<00:02:35.230> weren't<00:02:35.410> gonna<00:02:35.500> go<00:02:35.680> back<00:02:35.799> in

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
were done we weren't gonna go back in

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.590 
were done we weren't gonna go back in
and<00:02:36.069> out<00:02:36.220> anyways<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:36.880> kind<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.120> predicted

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and out anyways we kind of predicted

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360 
and out anyways we kind of predicted
that<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.810> rain<00:02:38.019> was<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.769> rolling<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
that the rain was just rolling and I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.830 
that the rain was just rolling and I
think<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.609> lot<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.760> people<00:02:39.850> did<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.569> us<00:02:40.660> it's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
think a lot of people did so for us it's

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.120 
think a lot of people did so for us it's
not<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.019> big<00:02:41.200> deal

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
not a big deal

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.500 
not a big deal
a<00:02:42.160> lot<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.460> practice<00:02:42.850> all<00:02:43.000> week<00:02:43.030> long<00:02:43.330> we

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
a lot of practice all week long we

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.700 
a lot of practice all week long we
haven't<00:02:43.750> had<00:02:43.870> any<00:02:43.900> disturbances<00:02:44.650> from

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
haven't had any disturbances from

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.230 
haven't had any disturbances from
weather<00:02:45.040> yet<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> think<00:02:45.820> we<00:02:45.910> were<00:02:45.970> able<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
weather yet so I think we were able to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.490 
weather yet so I think we were able to
get<00:02:46.420> through<00:02:46.600> our<00:02:46.690> program<00:02:47.050> earlier<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
get through our program earlier in the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.380 
get through our program earlier in the
week<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.890> we're<00:02:48.850> gonna<00:02:48.940> be<00:02:49.060> good<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.270> go

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
week and we're gonna be good to go

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.730 
week and we're gonna be good to go
hopefully<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.810> doesn't<00:02:49.930> rain<00:02:50.050> tomorrow<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.620> we

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
hopefully it doesn't rain tomorrow so we

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.440 
hopefully it doesn't rain tomorrow so we
should<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.100> just<00:02:51.250> fine<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.760> think<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.360> will

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
should be just fine I think it will

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.820 
should be just fine I think it will
probably<00:02:52.630> be<00:02:52.750> good<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.230> some<00:02:53.260> rain<00:02:53.620> it'll

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
probably be good to have some rain it'll

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.320 
probably be good to have some rain it'll
take<00:02:54.160> some<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.490> rubber<00:02:54.670> away<00:02:54.940> last<00:02:55.180> year

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
take some of the rubber away last year

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.600 
take some of the rubber away last year
we<00:02:55.600> had<00:02:55.630> no<00:02:56.080> rain<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.890> entire<00:02:56.980> couple

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
we had no rain for the entire couple

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
we had no rain for the entire couple
weeks<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.940> we<00:02:58.030> were<00:02:58.150> here<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.600> that

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
weeks that we were here and that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.140 
weeks that we were here and that
basically<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.280> added<00:03:00.520> tons<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.910> tons<00:03:01.030> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
basically just added tons and tons of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.400 
basically just added tons and tons of
rubber<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.600> track<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.840> almost<00:03:02.080> made<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.290> a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
rubber on the track and almost made it a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.780 
rubber on the track and almost made it a
little<00:03:02.560> bit<00:03:02.710> slippery<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.130> think<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:03.430> race<00:03:03.610> day

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
little bit slippery I think I'm race day

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.220 
little bit slippery I think I'm race day
because<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> had<00:03:04.210> all<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.360> rubber<00:03:04.750> built<00:03:05.020> up

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
because you had all that rubber built up

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.530 
because you had all that rubber built up
and<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:05.920> us<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.580> think<00:03:07.030> it'll<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.210> great<00:03:07.360> to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
and for us now I think it'll be great to

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.970 
and for us now I think it'll be great to
get<00:03:07.660> some<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:07.930> cleaned<00:03:08.260> off<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.710> maybe

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
get some of that cleaned off and maybe

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980 
get some of that cleaned off and maybe
start<00:03:09.250> fresh<00:03:09.460> again<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.480> us<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.840> not

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
start fresh again and for us it's not

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.120 
start fresh again and for us it's not
going<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.170> affect<00:03:11.200> us<00:03:11.530> at<00:03:11.650> all<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.770> think<00:03:11.860> it'll

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
going to affect us at all I think it'll

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.650 
going to affect us at all I think it'll
be<00:03:12.190> almost<00:03:12.400> better<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:13.300> some<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
be almost better to to get some of it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570 
be almost better to to get some of it
washed<00:03:13.870> away<00:03:14.050> yeah<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.920> chevys<00:03:15.190> looks<00:03:15.340> strong

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
washed away yeah the chevys looks strong

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.970 
washed away yeah the chevys looks strong
i<00:03:15.610> think<00:03:16.420> i<00:03:16.660> think<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.200> hondas<00:03:17.530> will<00:03:17.620> be<00:03:17.710> great

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
i think i think the hondas will be great

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.280 
i think i think the hondas will be great
and<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.400> race<00:03:18.610> day<00:03:18.670> regardless<00:03:19.540> we<00:03:19.750> were<00:03:20.110> so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
and on race day regardless we were so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.600 
and on race day regardless we were so
strong<00:03:20.470> last<00:03:20.710> year<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.130> think<00:03:21.310> we've<00:03:21.490> been

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
strong last year and I think we've been

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.580 
strong last year and I think we've been
stronger<00:03:21.970> practice<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.930> will<00:03:23.050> be<00:03:23.170> strong<00:03:23.440> on

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
stronger practice and will be strong on

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.200 
stronger practice and will be strong on
race<00:03:23.770> day<00:03:23.800> for<00:03:24.160> sure<00:03:24.310> tomorrow<00:03:24.580> it's<00:03:24.910> hard<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
race day for sure tomorrow it's hard to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.090 
race day for sure tomorrow it's hard to
tell<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.870> really<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.500> difficult<00:03:26.770> to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
tell it really is it's just difficult to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.800 
tell it really is it's just difficult to
tell<00:03:27.280> how<00:03:27.550> we're<00:03:27.940> going<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.210> in<00:03:28.300> qualifying

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
tell how we're going to do in qualifying

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.800 
tell how we're going to do in qualifying
but<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.650> good<00:03:29.800> thing<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:30.010> qualifying<00:03:30.790> not<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
but the good thing is qualifying not the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.540 
but the good thing is qualifying not the
whole<00:03:31.960> thing<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.410> it's<00:03:32.950> really<00:03:33.220> about<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
whole thing here it's really about the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.640 
whole thing here it's really about the
race<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.060> qualifying<00:03:35.050> is<00:03:35.110> great<00:03:35.320> if<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.560> can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
race so qualifying is great if you can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.470 
race so qualifying is great if you can
qualify<00:03:35.830> on<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.280> pole<00:03:36.490> or<00:03:36.820> up<00:03:36.910> towards<00:03:37.300> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
qualify on the pole or up towards the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
qualify on the pole or up towards the
front<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.080> good<00:03:38.260> bragging<00:03:38.680> rights<00:03:38.920> but

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
front and it's good bragging rights but

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.580 
front and it's good bragging rights but
once<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.940> months<00:03:40.150> over<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:41.140> really<00:03:41.350> look<00:03:41.470> at

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
once the months over you really look at

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.960 
once the months over you really look at
how<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:41.800> did<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.160> race<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.340> that's<00:03:42.820> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
how you did in the race and that's the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.490 
how you did in the race and that's the
big<00:03:43.150> performance<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:44.020> you<00:03:44.110> want<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.320> have

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
big performance that you want to have

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.720 
big performance that you want to have
and<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.740> think<00:03:44.770> hunter<00:03:45.160> will<00:03:45.280> be<00:03:45.370> great<00:03:45.550> in<00:03:45.640> that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
and I think hunter will be great in that

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.890 
and I think hunter will be great in that
so<00:03:45.910> tomorrow<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.240> going<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.510> difficult<00:03:46.660> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
so tomorrow is going to be difficult to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.850 
so tomorrow is going to be difficult to
tell<00:03:47.050> I<00:03:47.080> don't<00:03:47.320> know<00:03:47.410> what<00:03:47.530> we're<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.800> be

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
tell I don't know what we're going to be

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.380 
tell I don't know what we're going to be
sitting<00:03:48.100> at<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:48.400> hopefully<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.240> get<00:03:49.300> in

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
sitting at but hopefully we can get in

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.610 
sitting at but hopefully we can get in
that<00:03:49.480> fast<00:03:49.750> nine<00:03:49.960> if<00:03:50.080> we're<00:03:50.230> up<00:03:50.320> there<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.500> think

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
that fast nine if we're up there I think

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.010 
that fast nine if we're up there I think
we'll<00:03:50.800> be<00:03:50.890> happy
