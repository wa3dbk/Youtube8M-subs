hey<00:00:01.860> everybody<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.610> Santa<00:00:03.510> Tesla<00:00:03.720> calm

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hey everybody this is Santa Tesla calm

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.700 
hey everybody this is Santa Tesla calm
with<00:00:04.710> my<00:00:05.270> yin<00:00:06.270> yang<00:00:06.540> magnet<00:00:07.410> motor

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
with my yin yang magnet motor

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.290 
with my yin yang magnet motor
configuration<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.700> got<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.970> all<00:00:09.120> together

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
configuration I got it all together

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.640 
configuration I got it all together
finally<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:11.900> see<00:00:12.900> i<00:00:12.929> got<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:14.299> 20-pound<00:00:15.650> stat

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
finally and see i got the 20-pound stat

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.700 
finally and see i got the 20-pound stat
ER<00:00:17.090> or<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> rotor<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.720> got<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.320> here

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
ER or so I rotor and I got this on here

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
ER or so I rotor and I got this on here
and<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.949> haven't<00:00:23.220> given<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.490> spin<00:00:24.330> yet<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> see

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and I haven't given a spin yet to see

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.000 
and I haven't given a spin yet to see
what's<00:00:24.869> supposed<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> work<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> idea<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.920> that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
what's supposed to work the idea is that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.050 
what's supposed to work the idea is that
I'm<00:00:26.279> utilizing<00:00:27.949> centrifugal<00:00:28.949> force<00:00:29.429> coupled

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I'm utilizing centrifugal force coupled

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.389 
I'm utilizing centrifugal force coupled
with<00:00:30.179> centripetal<00:00:30.779> force<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> inward<00:00:32.070> force

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
with centripetal force the inward force

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.150 
with centripetal force the inward force
by<00:00:33.390> having<00:00:33.690> these<00:00:33.780> magnets<00:00:34.260> bounce<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
by having these magnets bounce back and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200 
by having these magnets bounce back and
turn<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.079> goes<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.210> repulsion

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
turn this as it goes into the repulsion

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.170 
turn this as it goes into the repulsion
zone<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:40.020> start<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.820> idea<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
zone which would start here the idea is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
zone which would start here the idea is
that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.540> magnets<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.079> bounced<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.680> push

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that the magnets get bounced back push

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
that the magnets get bounced back push
it<00:00:44.789> around<00:00:45.059> say<00:00:45.840> let's<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.559> let's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it around say let's get out here let's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
it around say let's get out here let's
get<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> header<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> repulsion<00:00:48.120> zone

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
get a header this is the repulsion zone

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.729 
get a header this is the repulsion zone
we<00:00:48.629> don't<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.440> let's<00:00:49.620> get

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we don't want to be in here let's get

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160 
we don't want to be in here let's get
into<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> extraction<00:00:51.000> zone<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.079> them

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
into the extraction zone two of them

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.049 
into the extraction zone two of them
will<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.440> doing<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.860> while<00:00:53.520> two<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:53.940> are

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
will be doing that while two of them are

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
will be doing that while two of them are
going<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> attraction<00:00:55.260> zone<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
going into the attraction zone and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.760 
going into the attraction zone and
hitting<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.520> hopefully<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.940> 20-pound

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
hitting here and hopefully the 20-pound

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.000 
hitting here and hopefully the 20-pound
big<00:00:58.770> heavy<00:00:59.480> spinning<00:01:00.480> mass<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.800> rotor

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
big heavy spinning mass of the rotor

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
big heavy spinning mass of the rotor
will<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.969> sufficient<00:01:03.210> enough<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.930> bring<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
will be sufficient enough to bring it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.039 
will be sufficient enough to bring it
into<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.339> repulsion<00:01:05.909> zone<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> one

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
into the repulsion zone over that one

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
into the repulsion zone over that one
inch<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:08.540> don't<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> work

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
inch I don't know if it's going to work

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.090 
inch I don't know if it's going to work
it's<00:01:10.320> probably<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> work<00:01:11.070> because

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it's probably not going to work because

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
it's probably not going to work because
it's<00:01:11.520> impossible<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.570> i'm<00:01:12.689> hoping<00:01:12.869> i<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.140> get

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's impossible but i'm hoping i can get

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's impossible but i'm hoping i can get
it<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.680> optimum<00:01:14.130> speed<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:15.119> it'll

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it up to an optimum speed where it'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.609 
it up to an optimum speed where it'll
overcome<00:01:15.900> any<00:01:17.270> well<00:01:18.290> overcome<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> inertia

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
overcome any well overcome the inertia

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
overcome any well overcome the inertia
and<00:01:20.009> negative<00:01:20.700> resistance<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> repulsion

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and negative resistance of the repulsion

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.550 
and negative resistance of the repulsion
zone<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> let's<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.420> sliding<00:01:25.080> magnet

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
zone so let's see if this sliding magnet

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
zone so let's see if this sliding magnet
repulsive<00:01:26.009> technology<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.640> works<00:01:27.060> or

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
repulsive technology actually works or

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.710 
repulsive technology actually works or
not<00:01:27.930> i<00:01:28.409> did<00:01:28.470> add<00:01:28.799> some<00:01:29.670> more<00:01:29.820> magnets<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.540> on

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
not i did add some more magnets here on

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.670 
not i did add some more magnets here on
the<00:01:30.930> end<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> tubes<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.689> cause<00:01:33.689> her<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the end of the tubes to cause her to be

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
the end of the tubes to cause her to be
a<00:01:34.710> further<00:01:35.549> repulsion<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> center<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
a further repulsion in the center of the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
a further repulsion in the center of the
tube<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.250> magnets<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:38.909> right

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
tube with the magnets that are right

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810 
tube with the magnets that are right
here<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.259> bounced<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.579> won't<00:01:41.759> be

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
here so when he bounced back it won't be

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
here so when he bounced back it won't be
so<00:01:42.000> far<00:01:42.299> away<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.990> i'll<00:01:43.200> still<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.530> some

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so far away and i'll still have some

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.330 
so far away and i'll still have some
repulsion<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.180> turning<00:01:45.600> effect<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.979> trying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
repulsion and turning effect so trying

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
repulsion and turning effect so trying
to<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.729> centripetal<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.720> inward

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
to make use of centripetal or inward

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.999 
to make use of centripetal or inward
force<00:01:50.540> coupled<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.560> weight<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
force coupled with the the weight on the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.389 
force coupled with the the weight on the
outside<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> rotor<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.210> thicker<00:01:55.399> right

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
outside of the rotor is thicker right

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.990 
outside of the rotor is thicker right
here<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.100> give<00:01:59.159> me<00:01:59.399> centrifugal

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
here so that will give me centrifugal

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200 
here so that will give me centrifugal
force<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> outward<00:02:02.460> pulling<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
force the outward pulling from the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.289 
force the outward pulling from the
center<00:02:03.799> ok<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.579> nervous<00:02:05.729> probably

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
center ok a little bit nervous probably

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.469 
center ok a little bit nervous probably
won't<00:02:06.540> work<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.819> least<00:02:08.819> i'm<00:02:08.970> showing<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.300> what
