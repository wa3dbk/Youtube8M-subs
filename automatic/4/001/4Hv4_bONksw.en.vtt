00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
concealer now I'm somewhat of a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.670 
concealer now I'm somewhat of a
concealer<00:01:11.430> connoisseur<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.409> think

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
concealer connoisseur and I don't think

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.980 
concealer connoisseur and I don't think
these<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.150> really<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.390> super<00:01:16.049> identical

this<00:01:18.990> one's<00:01:19.200> definitely<00:01:19.500> creamier<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

one<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.280> does<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.580> good

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

one is but this one does have good
coverage<00:01:24.450> especially<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> cost<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:27.030> can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
coverage especially for the cost it can

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080

good concealer for the price I think

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.480 
good concealer for the price I think
it's<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.850> five<00:02:00.240> dollars<00:02:00.479> maybe<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.490> cherry

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
culture calm but I do like this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.260 
culture calm but I do like this
concealer<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.680> does<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> scent<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
concealer it does have like a scent to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.070 
concealer it does have like a scent to
it<00:02:09.300> though<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> floral<00:02:11.039> scent

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
it though it's like a floral scent

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.200 
it though it's like a floral scent
and<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.860> thing<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.190> get<00:02:13.250> concerned<00:02:13.580> about<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
and one thing I get concerned about is

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.760 
maybe when I get too deep in the jar
like<00:02:16.310> especially<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> have<00:02:17.210> nails

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
getting to the product it would be

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.870 
getting to the product it would be
difficult<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.510> may<00:02:20.690> need<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.020> use<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.200> brush

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880

fair skin tone this is already too dark

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.770 
fair skin tone this is already too dark
for<00:03:50.239> me<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.950> that's<00:03:51.950> how<00:03:52.190> most<00:03:52.790> drugstore

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
for me and that's how most drugstore

yellow<00:03:54.230> color<00:03:54.530> correctors<00:03:55.130> are<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:56.030> nice

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
yellow color correctors are the nice

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.320 
yellow color correctors are the nice
thing<00:03:56.600> about<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:57.110> NYX<00:03:57.709> color<00:03:58.160> corrector<00:03:58.880> is

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
thing about this NYX color corrector is

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.640 
thing about this NYX color corrector is
that<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.470> much<00:04:00.950> more<00:04:01.310> light<00:04:02.300> toned<00:04:02.840> yellow

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
that it's a much more light toned yellow

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.070 
that it's a much more light toned yellow
so<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.160> will<00:04:04.280> actually<00:04:04.550> work<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.300> someone<00:04:05.870> with

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
so it will actually work on someone with

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.880 
so it will actually work on someone with
a<00:04:06.290> lighter<00:04:06.620> skin<00:04:06.860> tone<00:04:07.239> like<00:04:08.239> myself<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:12.560> do

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
a lighter skin tone like myself so I do

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.820 
a lighter skin tone like myself so I do
like<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.850> again<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:15.080> does<00:04:15.230> have<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.440> scent

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
like that and again it does have a scent

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.430 
like that and again it does have a scent
it's<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.450> floral<00:04:17.450> e<00:04:17.600> sense<00:04:17.930> if<00:04:18.169> you're

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
it's a floral e sense if you're

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's a floral e sense if you're
sensitive<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.340> do<00:04:19.790> be<00:04:20.000> aware<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:22.010> then<00:04:22.700> I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
sensitive to that do be aware and then I

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.740 
sensitive to that do be aware and then I
have<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.450> lavender<00:04:23.960> which<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.260> was<00:04:24.380> think

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
have the lavender which I was think

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.680 
have the lavender which I was think
and<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:26.130> picture<00:04:26.490> looked<00:04:26.730> kind<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.120> more<00:04:27.360> pink

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
and the picture looked kind of more pink

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.420 
and the picture looked kind of more pink
so<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.110> was<00:04:28.260> think<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.740> that'll<00:04:29.100> be<00:04:29.250> good

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
so I was think you know that'll be good

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.290 
so I was think you know that'll be good
for<00:04:29.490> under-eye<00:04:30.480> circles<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.920> it's<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.730> so

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
for under-eye circles and it's not so

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.060 
for under-eye circles and it's not so
what<00:04:33.690> I've<00:04:33.840> done<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.080> I've<00:04:34.380> ended<00:04:34.620> up<00:04:34.770> using

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
what I've done is I've ended up using

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.010 
what I've done is I've ended up using
this<00:04:35.340> as<00:04:35.520> an<00:04:35.670> eyeshadow<00:04:35.790> base<00:04:36.270> because<00:04:36.810> it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
this as an eyeshadow base because it's

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.440 
this as an eyeshadow base because it's
not<00:04:37.290> really<00:04:37.590> gonna<00:04:37.740> conceal<00:04:38.310> anything<00:04:38.730> for<00:04:39.300> me

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
not really gonna conceal anything for me

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
not really gonna conceal anything for me
um<00:04:40.670> so<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.700> do<00:04:41.970> kind<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.480> regret<00:04:42.960> buying<00:04:43.170> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
um so I do kind of regret buying the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.890 
um so I do kind of regret buying the
lavender<00:04:44.010> one<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.550> do<00:04:44.640> like<00:04:44.970> these<00:04:45.240> two<00:04:45.690> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
lavender one but I do like these two the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.070 
lavender one but I do like these two the
yellow<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:47.330> flesh<00:04:48.330> tone<00:04:48.630> one<00:04:48.870> and

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
there's a very good color selection to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.370 
there's a very good color selection to
the<00:04:52.380> next<00:04:52.770> concealer<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.460> jar<00:04:53.670> almost<00:04:54.380> too

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
good of a color selection because you're

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.790

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
looking on there and it's kind of

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.830 
looking on there and it's kind of
confusing<00:04:59.430> like<00:04:59.610> oh<00:04:59.790> I<00:04:59.820> could<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.630> shade

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.100 
confusing like oh I could be this shade
this<00:05:01.020> shade<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.590> shade<00:05:02.450> but<00:05:03.450> overall<00:05:03.810> like

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
this shade in the shade but overall like

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.740 
this shade in the shade but overall like
I<00:05:04.230> said<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.590> like<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.610> am<00:05:05.970> NOT<00:05:06.300> somebody

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
I said I do like this I am NOT somebody

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.090 
I said I do like this I am NOT somebody
who's<00:05:06.990> sensitive<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:08.190> scents<00:05:08.820> though<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.860> I'm

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
who's sensitive to scents though and I'm

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.190 
who's sensitive to scents though and I'm
not<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.730> have<00:05:12.210> not<00:05:12.420> looked<00:05:12.690> at<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> ingredients

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
not I have not looked at the ingredients

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.400 
not I have not looked at the ingredients
on<00:05:14.010> this<00:05:14.330> let's<00:05:15.330> see<00:05:15.480> it<00:05:15.600> does<00:05:15.780> have<00:05:15.990> mineral

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
on this let's see it does have mineral

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.600 
on this let's see it does have mineral
oil<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.960> does<00:05:19.200> contain<00:05:19.560> silica<00:05:20.010> which<00:05:20.190> is<00:05:20.370> good

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
oil it does contain silica which is good

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.900 
oil it does contain silica which is good
because<00:05:20.760> silica<00:05:21.419> helps<00:05:21.750> prevent<00:05:22.610> things<00:05:23.610> from

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
because silica helps prevent things from

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.120 
because silica helps prevent things from
getting<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.270> fine<00:05:24.480> lines<00:05:24.660> although<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:25.770> find

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
getting in fine lines although I do find

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.460 
getting in fine lines although I do find
it<00:05:26.370> does<00:05:26.550> still<00:05:27.120> get<00:05:27.419> into<00:05:27.570> those<00:05:27.840> lines<00:05:28.169> a

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
it does still get into those lines a

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.980 
it does still get into those lines a
little<00:05:28.950> bit<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.400> one<00:05:30.060> way<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.270> prevent<00:05:30.810> that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
little bit and one way to prevent that

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.740 
little bit and one way to prevent that
too<00:05:31.470> is<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.919> take<00:05:32.160> your<00:05:32.460> eye<00:05:32.490> primer<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.480> put

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
too is to take your eye primer and put

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.100 
too is to take your eye primer and put
it<00:05:33.900> underneath<00:05:34.890> your<00:05:35.340> eye<00:05:35.660> same<00:05:36.660> thing<00:05:36.930> it

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
it underneath your eye same thing it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.659 
it underneath your eye same thing it
helps<00:05:37.380> prevent<00:05:37.680> creasing<00:05:37.980> it'll<00:05:38.460> help

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
helps prevent creasing it'll help

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.780 
helps prevent creasing it'll help
prevent<00:05:39.240> things<00:05:39.419> settling<00:05:40.110> into<00:05:40.380> fine<00:05:40.410> lines

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
prevent things settling into fine lines

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.050 
prevent things settling into fine lines
but<00:05:41.840> overall<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:43.110> do<00:05:43.169> recommend<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:44.100> again<00:05:44.669> it

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
but overall I do recommend it again it

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.600 
but overall I do recommend it again it
is<00:05:45.720> it<00:05:45.990> can<00:05:46.229> be<00:05:46.410> difficult<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:46.979> get<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.190> hold<00:05:47.430> of

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
is it can be difficult to get a hold of

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.610 
is it can be difficult to get a hold of
because<00:05:48.000> they<00:05:48.150> don't<00:05:48.330> sell<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:48.840> in<00:05:49.050> stores<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
because they don't sell this in stores I

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.460 
because they don't sell this in stores I
mean<00:05:49.800> even<00:05:50.100> Ulta<00:05:50.970> that<00:05:51.120> solves<00:05:51.450> some<00:05:51.750> NYX<00:05:52.110> does

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
mean even Ulta that solves some NYX does

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.590 
mean even Ulta that solves some NYX does
not<00:05:52.680> carry<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.220> concealer<00:05:53.729> in<00:05:53.880> a<00:05:53.970> jar<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.419> wish

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
not carry the concealer in a jar I wish

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.920 
not carry the concealer in a jar I wish
they<00:05:54.810> would<00:05:55.080> but<00:05:55.440> they<00:05:55.590> don't<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:57.570> have<00:05:57.780> to

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
they would but they don't so you have to

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.380 
they would but they don't so you have to
get<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.169> from<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.500> next<00:05:58.860> website<00:05:59.070> or<00:05:59.610> cherry
