00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
learned how to play with it it's a

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.760 
learned how to play with it it's a
really<00:01:30.490> snazzy<00:01:30.820> attachment<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.200> what<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:32.590> do

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
really snazzy attachment so what you do

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.460 
really snazzy attachment so what you do
is<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.100> screw<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.759> here<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.810> comes<00:01:35.200> right

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
is you screw it in here it comes right

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.980 
is you screw it in here it comes right
down<00:01:35.530> here<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:37.060> there's<00:01:37.299> this<00:01:37.450> pointy

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
down here and then there's this pointy

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.399 
down here and then there's this pointy
thing<00:01:38.259> that's<00:01:38.530> really<00:01:38.920> really<00:01:39.159> sharp<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
thing that's really really sharp and you

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.499 
thing that's really really sharp and you
have<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.979> little<00:01:42.159> cap<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.759> goes<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.210> top

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
have this little cap that goes on top

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.600 
have this little cap that goes on top
you<00:01:43.899> want<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.200> mean<00:01:44.229> I<00:01:44.530> really<00:01:44.890> did<00:01:45.040> stab<00:01:45.340> myself

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
you want I mean I really did stab myself

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.880 
you want I mean I really did stab myself
and<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:46.750> kind<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.079> like<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.290> compass

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
and then it's kind of like a compass

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.480 
and then it's kind of like a compass
this<00:01:48.189> moves<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:49.149> different<00:01:49.840> positions<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
this moves to different positions you

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.520 
this moves to different positions you
put<00:01:51.700> your<00:01:51.880> fabric<00:01:52.149> on<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.930> then<00:01:53.320> you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
put your fabric on it and then you

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.819 
put your fabric on it and then you
stitch<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:55.299> course<00:01:55.659> in<00:01:56.079> something<00:01:56.619> like

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
stitch so of course in something like

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.789 
stitch so of course in something like
this<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:57.610> using<00:01:57.880> am<00:01:58.689> using<00:01:59.079> Ricky<00:01:59.469> Tim's

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
this I was using am using Ricky Tim's

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.840 
this I was using am using Ricky Tim's
stable<00:02:00.670> stuff<00:02:00.909> here<00:02:01.329> but<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.020> found<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
stable stuff here but I found that the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.389 
stable stuff here but I found that the
circles<00:02:04.360> were<00:02:04.509> not<00:02:04.719> meeting<00:02:05.140> up<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.039> called

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
circles were not meeting up so I called

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.930 
I'm just easing it and so it's kind of
working<00:04:26.800> like<00:04:27.099> a<00:04:27.129> compass

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.970 

now<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.600> reason<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:32.220> want<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.580> use<00:04:32.790> the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
now the reason you want to use the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.640 
now the reason you want to use the
cutaway<00:04:34.980> stabilizer<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:36.660> because<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.440> this

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
cutaway stabilizer is because in this

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.250 
cutaway stabilizer is because in this
quilt<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.520> Livi's<00:04:38.880> quilts<00:04:39.480> she<00:04:40.110> would

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
quilt and in Livi's quilts she would

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.340 
quilt and in Livi's quilts she would
have<00:04:40.440> concentric<00:04:41.280> circles<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.930> little

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
have concentric circles and this little

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.520 
have concentric circles and this little
sharp<00:04:43.740> point<00:04:44.130> would<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.330> start<00:04:45.690> chewing<00:04:46.170> up

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
sharp point would just start chewing up

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.600 
sharp point would just start chewing up
the<00:04:46.740> tearaway<00:04:47.520> stabilizer<00:04:48.410> oh<00:04:49.410> my<00:04:50.220> gosh<00:04:50.400> I

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
