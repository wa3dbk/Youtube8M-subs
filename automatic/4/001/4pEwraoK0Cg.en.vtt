00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
clover and that's one of the problems is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.200 
clover and that's one of the problems is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it doesn't always play the correct

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.060 
it doesn't always play the correct
figure<00:02:08.250> sound<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.530> heard<00:02:10.649> clover

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
figure sound so here you heard clover

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.890 
figure sound so here you heard clover
long<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> clover<00:02:12.180> voiceless<00:02:12.510> Sophia

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
long time the clover voiceless Sophia

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.530 
long time the clover voiceless Sophia
and<00:02:13.170> vice<00:02:13.350> versa<00:02:13.820> another<00:02:14.820> challenge<00:02:15.270> with<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and vice versa another challenge with it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
and vice versa another challenge with it
is<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.840> Sophia<00:02:16.230> doesn't<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
is that Sophia doesn't really want to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.040 
is that Sophia doesn't really want to
stand<00:02:17.180> anything<00:02:18.180> her<00:02:18.420> feet<00:02:18.630> aren't<00:02:18.810> broad

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.010 
stand anything her feet aren't broad
enough<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.590> she<00:02:20.220> falls<00:02:20.610> even<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.780> pretty

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
enough so she falls even on a pretty

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660 
enough so she falls even on a pretty
flat<00:02:22.290> surface<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.459> kind<00:02:23.640> of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
flat surface so that's kind of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.310 
flat surface so that's kind of
disappointing<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.720> second<00:02:25.020> thing<00:02:25.170> that's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
disappointing the second thing that's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.410 
disappointing the second thing that's
kind<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.620> disappointing<00:02:26.010> about<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
kind of disappointing about it is the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.030 
kind of disappointing about it is the
actual<00:02:27.540> bed<00:02:27.930> itself<00:02:28.290> inside<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.860> castle<00:02:29.100> now

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
actual bed itself inside the castle now

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.180 
actual bed itself inside the castle now
get<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> little<00:02:32.340> closer<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:34.010> what<00:02:35.010> you'll

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
get you a little closer and what you'll

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.880 
get you a little closer and what you'll
see<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.690> doesn't<00:02:36.959> fit<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.350> great

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
see is that it doesn't fit that great

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.300 
see is that it doesn't fit that great
somewhat<00:02:38.760> awkward<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.989> its<00:02:40.440> design<00:02:40.860> now<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
somewhat awkward in its design now the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.780 
somewhat awkward in its design now the
castle<00:02:41.760> itself<00:02:41.970> comes<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> bed<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
castle itself comes with a bed but the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.060 
castle itself comes with a bed but the
royal<00:02:45.000> bed<00:02:45.500> doesn't<00:02:46.500> fit<00:02:48.110> like<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> she

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
royal bed doesn't fit like that she

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.060 
royal bed doesn't fit like that she
could<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.670> hangs<00:02:50.850> over<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.209> edge

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.949 

if<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.220> push<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> all<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.090> way<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> kind<00:02:57.840> of

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
if you push it all the way in it kind of

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.840 
if you push it all the way in it kind of
fits<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:58.380> not<00:02:58.500> real<00:02:58.709> well<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.610> I'm<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> little

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
fits but not real well so I'm a little

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.550 
fits but not real well so I'm a little
disappointed<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.660> made<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> bed<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
disappointed that they made a bed that

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.070 
disappointed that they made a bed that
doesn't<00:03:02.030> fit<00:03:03.030> inside<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> castle<00:03:03.720> it's

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
doesn't fit inside the castle it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.250 
doesn't fit inside the castle it's
designed<00:03:04.410> for<00:03:05.180> but<00:03:06.180> again<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.080> same

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
designed for but again so as the same

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.789 
designed for but again so as the same
little<00:03:07.620> way<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:08.250> okay<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> castle

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
little way it's okay but with the castle

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.680 
little way it's okay but with the castle
you<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.489> would<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:12.299> designed<00:03:12.570> a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
you think it would have been designed a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.400 
you think it would have been designed a
little<00:03:12.780> bit<00:03:12.930> better<00:03:14.600> final<00:03:15.600> few<00:03:15.810> thoughts<00:03:16.200> on

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
little bit better final few thoughts on

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.170 
little bit better final few thoughts on
the<00:03:16.620> Sofia<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.070> first<00:03:17.100> royal<00:03:17.489> bed<00:03:17.730> I'm<00:03:17.970> gonna

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the Sofia the first royal bed I'm gonna

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.750 
the Sofia the first royal bed I'm gonna
give<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.420> four<00:03:19.080> stars<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.549> some<00:03:20.730> ways

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
give it four stars I think in some ways

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.400 
give it four stars I think in some ways
that<00:03:21.030> makes<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.330> better<00:03:21.540> alternative<00:03:22.200> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that makes them better alternative to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.630 
that makes them better alternative to
the<00:03:22.500> castle<00:03:22.890> because<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:25.500> get<00:03:25.890> clover<00:03:26.430> and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the castle because you get clover and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.250 
the castle because you get clover and
Sophie<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.060> both<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.540> those<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.900> my

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
Sophie if both and those are my

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.570 
Sophie if both and those are my
daughter's<00:03:28.590> two<00:03:28.769> favorite<00:03:29.100> characters<00:03:29.250> on

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
daughter's two favorite characters on

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.440 
daughter's two favorite characters on
the<00:03:29.670> show<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:31.549> if<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.730> buying<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.150> with

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the show and if you're buying it with

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.690 
the show and if you're buying it with
the<00:03:34.019> castle<00:03:34.470> you'll<00:03:35.010> end<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.459> two

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the castle you'll end up with two

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.090 
the castle you'll end up with two
clovers<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.239> two<00:03:36.510> Sophia's<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.200> from<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
clovers and two Sophia's so from that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.820 
clovers and two Sophia's so from that
same<00:03:38.280> point<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> little<00:03:38.790> disappointing

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
same point it's a little disappointing

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.259 
same point it's a little disappointing
the<00:03:40.830> bed<00:03:41.040> itself<00:03:41.340> doesn't<00:03:41.670> fit<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:41.880> well

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
the bed itself doesn't fit that well

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.009 
the bed itself doesn't fit that well
into<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.650> castle<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.780> doesn't

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
into it in the castle so it doesn't

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.509 
into it in the castle so it doesn't
necessarily<00:03:46.140> make<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> good<00:03:46.739> acessory<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
necessarily make a good acessory to the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.300 
necessarily make a good acessory to the
castle<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:48.780> finally<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.890> one<00:03:50.070> thing<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
castle and then finally the one thing I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.650 
castle and then finally the one thing I
do<00:03:50.370> say<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> negative<00:03:51.209> about<00:03:51.360> this

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
do say is a negative about this

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.319 
do say is a negative about this
particular<00:03:52.019> toy<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:53.700> Sofia<00:03:54.090> doesn't

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
particular toy is that one Sofia doesn't

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.190 
particular toy is that one Sofia doesn't
fit<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.630> perfectly<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.910> she's<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> little<00:03:57.989> bit

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
fit in perfectly but she's a little bit

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.789 
fit in perfectly but she's a little bit
flimsy<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.180> she<00:04:00.180> won't<00:04:00.299> stand<00:04:00.690> at<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.140> so

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
flimsy and she won't stand at all so

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.759 
flimsy and she won't stand at all so
keep<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.220> mind<00:04:02.959> it's<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.230> ages<00:04:04.530> three

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
keep that in mind it's for ages three

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.350 
keep that in mind it's for ages three
and<00:04:04.799> up<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.190> because<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.790> size<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.209> some

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
and up and because of the size of some

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.590 
and up and because of the size of some
of<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.950> accessories<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> bird<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
of the accessories like the bird and the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.780 
of the accessories like the bird and the
dolly<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.350> even<00:04:10.560> clover<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.100> probably<00:04:11.579> want

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
dolly and even clover you probably want

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.599 
dolly and even clover you probably want
to<00:04:11.850> keep<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.590> away<00:04:13.590> from<00:04:13.769> children<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.459> are

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
to keep it away from children that are

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.069 
to keep it away from children that are
prone<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> putting<00:04:15.239> things<00:04:15.480> in<00:04:15.600> their<00:04:15.720> mouths

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
prone to putting things in their mouths

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.729 
prone to putting things in their mouths
so<00:04:16.440> from<00:04:17.130> my<00:04:17.220> standpoint<00:04:17.459> four<00:04:17.910> stars

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
so from my standpoint four stars

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.590 
so from my standpoint four stars
it's<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.340> nice<00:04:19.489> toy<00:04:19.639> my<00:04:19.970> daughter<00:04:20.150> likes<00:04:20.419> it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
it's a nice toy my daughter likes it
