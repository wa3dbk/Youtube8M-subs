you can work in After Effects with the
Mac<00:02:11.140> Mini<00:02:11.170> there's<00:02:11.860> no<00:02:12.010> doubt<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.430> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
Mac Mini there's no doubt of it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.410 
Mac Mini there's no doubt of it
you<00:02:13.209> will<00:02:13.420> lose<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.800> render<00:02:15.069> times<00:02:15.420> that's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
you will lose on the render times that's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.350 
you will lose on the render times that's
a<00:02:16.510> fact<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.750> not<00:02:20.080> about<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:21.360> GPU

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
a fact and here it's not about the GPU

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.710 
a fact and here it's not about the GPU
it's<00:02:22.959> more<00:02:23.349> about<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.220> CPU<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
it's more about the CPU and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.560 
it's more about the CPU and
and<00:02:26.810> RAM<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:27.920> Ram<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.370> has<00:02:28.520> 16<00:02:29.150> gigabytes<00:02:29.240> of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
and RAM but Ram it has 16 gigabytes of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.620 
and RAM but Ram it has 16 gigabytes of
RAM<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:29.960> it's<00:02:30.440> modded<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.160> CPU<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.000> doesn't

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
RAM so it's modded the CPU that doesn't

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.660 
RAM so it's modded the CPU that doesn't
do<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.440> well<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.910> an<00:02:35.060> i7<00:02:36.010> 2.3<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.220> robust<00:02:37.520> at

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.700 
experience with your workflow you can
expect<00:02:54.580> not<00:02:55.580> excellent<00:02:56.300> results<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.320> as<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
expect not excellent results but as I

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.590 
expect not excellent results but as I
say<00:02:58.160> if<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.030> making<00:02:59.300> small<00:03:00.020> projects<00:03:00.590> and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
say if you are making small projects and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.970 
say if you are making small projects and
bear<00:03:02.600> in<00:03:02.720> mind<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.650> template

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
not only motion blur but deaf alleles

not only motion blur but deaf alleles
camera<00:03:12.709> blur<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.220> things<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:15.020> not<00:03:15.110> a

cannot handle and why is that just

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.620 
cannot handle and why is that just
because<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.850> graphics<00:04:25.850> card<00:04:26.060> cannot<00:04:26.360> handle

course the the screenshot I waited about

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.300 
course the the screenshot I waited about
40<00:04:35.990> something<00:04:36.320> minutes<00:04:36.590> well<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:36.979> didn't<00:04:37.190> wait

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
40 something minutes well I didn't wait

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.490 
40 something minutes well I didn't wait
I<00:04:37.340> was<00:04:37.580> working<00:04:37.940> while<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.690> was<00:04:38.900> rendering<00:04:39.260> but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
I was working while it was rendering but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.450 
I was working while it was rendering but
I<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.780> was<00:04:41.960> 30<00:04:42.350> but<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:43.010> will<00:04:43.160> check<00:04:43.340> on

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
I think it was 30 but you will check on

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.000 
I think it was 30 but you will check on
the<00:04:43.490> screenshot<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.110> still<00:04:45.410> had<00:04:45.710> about

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the screenshot and it still had about

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.159 
the screenshot and it still had about
two<00:04:46.400> hours<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:46.970> three<00:04:47.360> hours<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.840> render

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
two hours so three hours to render

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.600 
two hours so three hours to render
something<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:48.979> just<00:04:49.040> give<00:04:49.400> up

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
something like that so I just give up

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.020 
something like that so I just give up
and<00:04:49.820> stopped<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.020> benchmark<00:04:51.729> it's<00:04:52.729> just

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030
