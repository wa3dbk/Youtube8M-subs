00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.779
 one evening this news broadcast is entirely devoted to the fire 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.279
 nature reserve aamsveen near enschede 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.900
 a large part of the nature reserve has been destroyed by the fire today 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 it concerns a large piece of forest and heathland and both Dutch and German 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.519
 territory 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.429
 at the nature reserve is giving report in london now has the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.890
 fire brigade the fire now under control 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.289
 yes the fire is under control is still not completely out 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.199
 every now and then the fire flares up a bit, it is mostly him 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.860
 they can say under control only on German territory there is 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 not yet under control, burning considerably 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.510
 landed around two o'clock in a meadow on the aamsveenweg the chinook helicopter of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 the Ministry of Defense 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.640
 the helicopter then flies after the black gap between enschede and 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 Haaksbergen 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 also 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 yes from that place about six times per hour over the aamsveen apeldoorn 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.930
 p 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 saw very direct that a large helicopter bus was used 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.350
 this afternoon only around two o'clock two newspapers was on fire this morning 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.250
 started 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 any idea why that took so long 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.570
 yes I wonder a lot of people why it was wonderful to get up so late 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.380
 he the costs 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.210
 yes no or 5 after a fire broke out you have divorcing hope 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 has been a hassle and the Department of Defense Wednesday is that 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.860
 chinook helicopter from I can venture my question on the Rhine for that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 points out that the fire brigade is known for weeks in July why it took so long 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.579
 no that is not known why 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.470
 some have been waiting for a long time we have applied for both we do not know where 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 nunspeet has been using the German police for so long ago 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.650
 arson what would have happened 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 the city that you already known 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.170
 have rights as a majority 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.740
 partly unknown whether arson is or not 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.440
 immense and fully engaged in fighting the fire and possible causes 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.369
 just have it examined 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.189
 it is therefore nice to see that the Brabanter is still out 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.129
 from that it is not pias golf course of still only in some countries 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.709
 do not expand further 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.469
 and on German territory something capable or willing to expand and there 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.609
 they are on the sunny side at the moment to put in the buses 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.479
 if that has happened then we will soon be putting everything on the shelves 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.549
 get out 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.339
 but the photos are this weekend 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.339
 As far as I know, the women's team will continue its firefighting activities 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.059
 it is at 6 pm 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.519
 the guard and senate a dam present because of the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.689
 extinguishing work and even irresponsible because of competition and 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.239
 that is allowed for five hours 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.209
 we go into the field and together with as a defense test a real buses 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.959
 put 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.990
 that's a lot of hassle today about how the area feels 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.650
 First it was said that 200 hectares of nature reserve went up in flames 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 were three then became the 60 70 what is it now 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.079
 Blair was unclear about translating an area about 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.939
 200 hectares 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.939
 also burned off between 70 and 100 hectares of land 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.479
 but let's take a look at what we already had quite early this morning 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.400
 then the Dutch side still burned in full force 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.209
 what know look at how it went then 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.099
 There are hot spots in several places in the area 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.729
 about sixty hectares of peat the entire peat area has burned down 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.389
 it is difficult to get the fire under control around one hundred and fifty 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.709
 firemen have been pulled out 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.759
 yes we have flown in from all over the region and to our German colleagues 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.589
 timing 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.269
 In addition, we thought fancy fair request laid out the best opportunities 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.269
 because it is difficult to extinguish with the spokeswoman 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.469
 Namely, injured the area is difficult to access 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.619
 weeping where he prevented the ground and heavy vehicles I have 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.719
 the area is very difficult to go 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:56.899
 the western countries 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.229
 of the cup 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.969
 the west of the seat of the fire 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.589
 as the crow flies that is one 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.219
 the 500 meters 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.699
 that is danger at present his father from one of the wind directions and 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.969
 I carry my hand 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.599
 how one is the minister 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.109
 comes to the aid 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 this is where the fire started 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.109
 still has some pasture between one of the two landscape overijssel 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.799
 and one of the brooks is unfortunately not much between a loan from the competition 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.900
 later Gavere in terms of nature nature is in the middle of the seasons so in particular 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.779
 junk young stuff young for young orange 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.249
 other ways 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.309
 the nature friends first have the fires in this period 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:35.740
 the vegetation 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.240
 what followed for the possible foot 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.240
 but find that you set yourself up fairly quickly 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.320
 as a precaution, a campsite near the seat of the fire has been evacuated 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.010
 there were about two hundred camping guests at that time, I understand it 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.430
 it had to be a design that surprised the army yesterday that it had everything 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.879
 dealing with a villa where it is fairly close and the wind 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.040
 he blew the wind 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.300
 changed lighting 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.690
 it is just necessary for the time being, let me say the newspapers 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.339
 anything happen 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.719
 I suffer from being back earlier 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.340
 there the scene became camping guests 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.340
 which led me to pack their things and find out what you were behind 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.809
 Valuables packed 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.999
 Unfortunately there are still a step further but we are clear its delicious 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.479
 at or in the center, we definitely want to be in third place 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.389
 takes 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.479
 how the fire started is still unclear but it is suspected 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.780
 local residents and landscape overijssel 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.099
 arson 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.389
 for the burned that there are several fire points 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.029
 the found so your house may be lost 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.879
 per cent 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.139
 but I can't say that 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 yes the local residents and the landscape overijssel deal assume 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.389
 arson the fire brigade will not fight them again 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.620
 chinook helicopter and see it fly right now 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.150
 the holes until 8 8 o'clock tonight the frieze that will eventually pass through afterwards 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.139
 fire brigade has therefore continue in the area and 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.990

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.469
 guarded we are no longer allowed to drive out that they still said 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.310
 all a bit too dangerous to recover this morning for a very short while 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.469
 And once he was there the whole weekend was still used to being here after 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.469
 to extinguish 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.759

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.759

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:22.949
 welcome memory chips points and the team looks for black lock 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.349
 black lock under sail that is the event that will be here for four days 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.729

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:45.729
 the fault closer 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.729
