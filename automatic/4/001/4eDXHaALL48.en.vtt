00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.179
 I present you so blur a new 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.280
 tweak cydia that will allow you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
 see to have 3d effects on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.310
 icons that is in your dock 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.869
 so in the setting panel 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
 first we find an option that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.949
 lets put it to eaunes or aof 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 we can also manage the continuous mode and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 activate or not the pagination if that we 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 interest so the cij activate it you 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 see that the effect is much less 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 fluid I pass icon by icons and that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 no slides alone as entirely 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.800
 the hour so I'm going to rather the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 disable one can also choose 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.559
 to display or not the names of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.000
 applications in the dock 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.290
 so that's what it gives when they 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 are activated so according to the facts 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 we choose it's not really pretty 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 so me the same I disable this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120
 option we can also center the icon 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 selected and underneath you and that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 has small sliders that we will be able to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 move to sort some things 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
 so the first is the spacing of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.430
 icons in the dock so admit it that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 I increased spacing and more 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.699
 great just now you can a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.960
 little bit played on it adjust this little 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 following settings what you prefer 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.010
 so it's really purely aesthetic 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 and even below is a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 other little slider that will allow us 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.720
 this one to adjust the speed of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 animations when sliding 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 I put them to the maximum and finally the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.080
 last adjusts the effect 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.909
 coverflow the prospect so all his 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 effects you find them here the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.720
 linear that's how it looks 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.350
 so you slip linearly 1 as 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.509
 his name says it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 that's how it works so at all 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.299
 moment you can return to the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.040
 settings select another effect 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 so this one the rotation is the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 first I showed you I find 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.200
 really nice it is super well done 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 this effect and we find the same but 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 reversed in 3rd position if I 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.329
 selects so voila when he gets 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.740
 therefore has the same rotation but 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.000
 as if we had a little bit 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.860
 applied a mirror effect 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.180
 So here we are for now 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.950
 a dozen facts that are all 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.829
 arrange here I 'm going to show you the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 following the cylinder so here it is 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.740
 how does it look so you have a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 little bit of rotation also of this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.250
 once in the form of a cylinder as if 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.000
 we had an axis in the middle and the icons 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.890
 which revolves around 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.659
 we also if we want the cylinder 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.950
 inverted so it will be the same effect but 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 like just now as if we had 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.670
 applied a mirror effect on it see 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 that it's reversed the following facts 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.119
 it will be and this one is going to give us 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.890
 the impression of having a small wheel 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780
 bottom of our springboard like that for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.490
 the icons of our 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.840
 doc we can slide to the right or 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 to the left for all the posters 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 and and it scrolls this way so 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.780
 rather nice too it was done next 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.760
 I hope yes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.290
 here he is always with a wheel but 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.800
 with a perspective effect on it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.090
 then cover for the well-known so 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.709
 it was done that you knew until 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.239
 you and six in the music app 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.580
 so you have the same effect on your 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.670
 dock that's how it works and 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.840
 then flipi that I'm wrong so 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.670
 here he is you see that small 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.020
 icons turns on itself even when you 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.530
 drag those that are 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.360
 in the dock 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.280
 so that's also pretty original 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.350
 is pretty cool this flipi effect for 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.390
 finish two time machine effects so 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.920
 the first is this one when 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.420
 slide here is the new animation 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.030
 condat on the icons that are found 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.890
 in our doc so the time machine effect 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.910
 inspired by time machine application 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.620
 on mac 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080
 so that's it scrolls like this super 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.160
 effect him too and finally if we go back 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.040
 in the settings we will find the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.060
 last time machine but inverted so 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.950
 again we want to find 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 the mirror effect applied on it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.760
 who will be this time in the other direction 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.709
 so that's how it all works 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.750
 super tweak if you're interested he 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.910
 so is called other waves like those 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.860
 available on the cydia store at the price 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.170
 of two dollars on the fashion source my 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.579
 eyes and who proposes for the moment a 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.470
 ten of etf is rather nice 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.910
 for the doc of your device and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.110
 I imagine that as and when 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.670
 updates of other effects 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.110
 will be added so said law in the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.079
 comments what you thought all 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.079
 this and see you soon for a next 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 Hi
