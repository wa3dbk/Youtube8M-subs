hybridisation<00:00:11.360> let's<00:00:12.360> start<00:00:12.690> off<00:00:12.809> with

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
hybridisation let's start off with

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.490 
hybridisation let's start off with
naming<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.889> type<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.370> experiment<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.179> is

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
naming what type of experiment this is

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.260 
naming what type of experiment this is
this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.000> finded<00:00:18.000> experiment<00:00:19.939> that<00:00:20.939> means

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this is a finded experiment that means

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
this is a finded experiment that means
not<00:00:21.510> lose<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.170> not<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> movement<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:23.070> not

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
not lose it's not a movement we're not

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.650 
not lose it's not a movement we're not

functions we are just going to find
something<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.500> where<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> localizes<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
something and see where it localizes and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.310 
something and see where it localizes and
it's<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:31.949> targeting<00:00:32.640> RNA

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.540 

RNA<00:00:37.579> I'll<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.910> parenthesis<00:00:39.450> DNA<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.020> well

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
RNA I'll put in parenthesis DNA as well

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.389 
RNA I'll put in parenthesis DNA as well
but<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.030> commonly<00:00:42.420> used<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.050> target

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
but it is more commonly used to target

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
but it is more commonly used to target
RNA<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.809> flew

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
RNA and it's going to do that flew

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
RNA and it's going to do that flew
through<00:00:47.370> fluorescence<00:00:48.239> oh<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> I'll<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

fluorescents<00:00:54.690> are<00:00:54.780> shiny<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
fluorescents are shiny and you want to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
fluorescents are shiny and you want to
do<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> any<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.469> an

gene<00:01:01.109> localizes<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.969> stage<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gene localizes to at this stage and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
gene localizes to at this stage and
development<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.040> situ

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
development you can use in situ

development you can use in situ
hybridization<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> way<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> works<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:09.200> we

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
hybridization the way it works is we

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
hybridization the way it works is we
take<00:01:10.590> our<00:01:10.799> cell<00:01:13.280> will<00:01:14.280> draw<00:01:14.520> our<00:01:14.790> nucleus

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
take our cell will draw our nucleus

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.640 
take our cell will draw our nucleus
always<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> nucleus<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.409> inside<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
always need a nucleus and inside the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.690 
always need a nucleus and inside the
cell<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.430> course<00:01:21.210> RNA<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> DNA<00:01:22.700> but

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
cell we have course RNA and DNA but

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
cell we have course RNA and DNA but
we'll<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.150> draw<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.509> real<00:01:24.780> quick<00:01:25.020> I'm

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we'll just draw this real quick I'm

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
we'll just draw this real quick I'm
drawing<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> upside<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.759> why

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
drawing it upside down you will see why

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:27.260 
drawing it upside down you will see why
later

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
later

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.550 
later
so<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.680> mRNA<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.259> we<00:01:31.259> could<00:01:31.409> also

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so we have some mRNA and we could also

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.100 
so we have some mRNA and we could also
have<00:01:31.710> DNA<00:01:32.430> inside<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.450> well<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.869> RNA

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
have DNA inside here as well as RNA

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.240 
have DNA inside here as well as RNA
inside<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> nucleus<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.939> too<00:01:36.090> important

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
inside the nucleus but not too important

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.090 
inside the nucleus but not too important
what<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> lab<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:40.100> we

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
what we will do out in the lab is we

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.840 
what we will do out in the lab is we
will<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:42.000> most<00:01:42.329> likely<00:01:42.390> order<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.850> mRNA

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
will make or most likely order and mRNA

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
will make or most likely order and mRNA
strand<00:01:46.670> or<00:01:48.020> construct<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
strand or construct which will have a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
strand or construct which will have a
fluorescent<00:01:50.970> tag<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:53.430> tag<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
fluorescent tag on it and a tag is just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
fluorescent tag on it and a tag is just
going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:56.159> sort<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> protein<00:01:57.630> complex

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
going to be some sort of protein complex

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.850 
going to be some sort of protein complex
that<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.840> are<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.710> necessarily

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that will are not not necessarily

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
that will are not not necessarily
protein<00:02:02.610> complex<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.329> sort<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> complex

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
protein complex but some sort of complex

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
protein complex but some sort of complex
that<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.610> looked<00:02:06.149> under<00:02:06.420> through<00:02:06.750> a

fluorescent
go<00:02:07.910> will<00:02:08.600> light<00:02:08.900> up<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.670> what<00:02:10.850> we<00:02:11.000> will<00:02:11.090> do<00:02:11.300> is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
go will light up so what we will do is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.370 
go will light up so what we will do is
inject<00:02:12.500> our<00:02:13.330> tag<00:02:16.660> tag<00:02:17.660> RNA<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:20.290> send<00:02:21.290> that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
inject our tag tag RNA and send that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.850 
inject our tag tag RNA and send that
into<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> cell<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.290> will<00:02:24.410> bind<00:02:24.680> to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
into the cell and then it will bind to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.290 
into the cell and then it will bind to
here<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.400> our<00:02:26.000> mRNA<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.760> our<00:02:28.760> fluorescence

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
here in our mRNA and our fluorescence

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.560 
here in our mRNA and our fluorescence
tag<00:02:29.600> will<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.420> it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
tag will be right there with it so it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.710 
tag will be right there with it so it
will<00:02:35.630> essentially<00:02:36.080> show<00:02:36.980> where<00:02:37.520> our<00:02:37.550> mRNA<00:02:38.240> is

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
will essentially show where our mRNA is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.260 
will essentially show where our mRNA is
located<00:02:39.320> inside<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.400> cell<00:02:40.640> or<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.060> tissue

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
thing to note is some of you may have

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.370 
thing to note is some of you may have
noticed<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.850> earlier<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.900> make<00:05:21.080> this

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
noticed that earlier to make this

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.310 
noticed that earlier to make this
complex<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.310> binds<00:05:22.790> on<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.150> mRNA<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.930> is<00:05:24.170> very

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
complex it binds on to mRNA and is very

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.850 
complex it binds on to mRNA and is very
similar<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.860> gene<00:05:25.540> knocking<00:05:26.540> out<00:05:26.690> or<00:05:27.200> RNA

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
similar to gene knocking out or RNA

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
fixing it in a space and time so you

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.860 
fixing it in a space and time so you

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.680 
interfering with RNA processes you only
