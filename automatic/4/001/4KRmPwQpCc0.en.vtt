00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.589
 gooseflesh in leipzig dinosaur 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.450
 make the arena rich of giants 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.099
 the live spectacle shows a total of ten 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.719
 different types of actually 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 extinct reptiles 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 the illustrated rise of the plants 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 and carnivore becomes one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 unforgettable experience 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 especially close to it is timo 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.689
 shepherd of the dinosaur era 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.840
 Sometimes it does it correctly 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 Creepy there are phases where I do that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.859
 of course, games and then I pull 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 me between the stage design parts 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.670
 so to speak back and there is such a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.590
 silent phase in the dinosaurs 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.090
 watch each other and then happened 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 sometimes that the allosaurus is so one 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 corner comes and there comes this huge 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 mouth this huge coup with this 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 open pines comes up that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.879
 The horse sometimes really clean 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 I think they are quite aware of that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.070
 fears of the rapid time travel 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.410
 The dinosaurs look incredibly real 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.360
 like creatures of flesh and blood 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 the spectators can among other things 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 marvel at how two gates dinosaur 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 start each other up to three 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.000
 people are for the noise and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.130
 movements of a giant responsible 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 Richie Skoda mainly we use 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 this pack gets that extra for the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 show was designed 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.610
 so i can turn the dinosaur around 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 move 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.799
 So head goes up and down me 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.979
 can move the body up and down 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.780
 Hereby I control the tail it is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.740
 a pretty simple device like that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.350
 complex dinosaur movements and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.939
 Noises are perfect on each other 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.140
 but it took a long time 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.140
 until everything fits 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.040
 It took a long time for the technology 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.329
 to work with the dinosaurs 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.549
 look realistic 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.280
 Then we had the show over the year 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.090
 but we have planned to put together 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 many years 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.180
 several times the makers of the dino show 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.610
 awarded that of the leipziger 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.050
 Folk paper presented is spectacular 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 a full success 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 the chance for families made believe 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.250
 me that 's probably the most 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 pleasure because it is so kept that it 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.020
 not too much scientific 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.370
 input is but it should also be 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.800
 open living fashion 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.580
 entertained and the fascination of the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.580
 to stimulate fantasy
