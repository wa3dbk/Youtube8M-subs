to cheat as well right exactly because

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.839 
to cheat as well right exactly because
when<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.709> dedicated<00:02:55.920> host<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.730> host

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
when you have a dedicated host the host

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.790 
when you have a dedicated host the host
becomes<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.360> authority<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> match<00:02:58.110> so

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
becomes the authority of the match so

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960 
becomes the authority of the match so
that<00:02:58.950> way<00:02:59.069> things<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.580> are<00:02:59.670> accumulated

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that way things that are accumulated

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.820 
that way things that are accumulated
like<00:03:00.330> statistics<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:01.170> come<00:03:01.410> from<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> host

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
like statistics all come from the host

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.229 
like statistics all come from the host
and<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.160> doesn't<00:03:02.370> provide<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> ability<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and it doesn't provide the ability for a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.600 
and it doesn't provide the ability for a
user<00:03:03.660> inside<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.260> session<00:03:04.530> actually<00:03:05.130> inject

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
user inside that session actually inject

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.130 
user inside that session actually inject
their<00:03:05.790> own<00:03:05.910> statistics<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:06.780> not<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
their own statistics so I'm not going to

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.990 
their own statistics so I'm not going to
be<00:03:07.260> able<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.590> blame<00:03:07.860> getting<00:03:08.370> beaten<00:03:08.549> on<00:03:08.790> host

game type on a very specific game you'll

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.920 
game type on a very specific game you'll
be<00:03:17.640> able<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.940> find<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.450> game<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
be able to find that game that you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.970 
be able to find that game that you
really<00:03:19.110> want<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.349> get<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:19.590> right<00:03:19.799> yeah

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
