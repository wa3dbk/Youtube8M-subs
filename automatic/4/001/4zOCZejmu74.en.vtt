00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.340 

this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.230> an<00:00:01.319> elaboration<00:00:01.920> on<00:00:02.370> my<00:00:03.110> step<00:00:04.110> two<00:00:04.319> of

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
this is an elaboration on my step two of

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.440 
this is an elaboration on my step two of
the<00:00:04.620> Rubik's<00:00:05.009> revenge<00:00:05.609> tutorial<00:00:06.270> edge

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the Rubik's revenge tutorial edge

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.980 
the Rubik's revenge tutorial edge
pairing<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:08.150> what<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.809> basically

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
pairing and what you do is you basically

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.709 
pairing and what you do is you basically
solve<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.740> edges<00:00:11.130> using<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.150> principle<00:00:12.690> called

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
solve the edges using a principle called

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.499 
solve the edges using a principle called
the<00:00:13.080> break<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.410> restore<00:00:13.769> principle<00:00:14.509> mostly

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the break and restore principle mostly

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.260 
the break and restore principle mostly
cupids<00:00:16.049> should<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.980> mean<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
cupids should know this I mean all you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
cupids should know this I mean all you
wish<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.189> break

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
wish you know this what you do you break

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.779 
wish you know this what you do you break
something<00:00:20.760> insert<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> restore<00:00:22.800> that's<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
something insert and restore that's the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.660 
something insert and restore that's the
concept<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.410> used<00:00:25.590> by<00:00:25.769> intuition<00:00:26.189> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
concept and it's used by intuition so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.019 
concept and it's used by intuition so
then<00:00:26.869> plot<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> solve<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.680> twelve<00:00:29.310> edge<00:00:29.609> pairs

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
then plot to solve all twelve edge pairs

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
then plot to solve all twelve edge pairs
I<00:00:30.380> don't<00:00:31.380> know<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.830> called<00:00:32.009> but

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
I don't know what these are called but

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.150 
I don't know what these are called but
how<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> say<00:00:33.450> edge<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:35.000> h1<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> h2<00:00:36.469> okay<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
how to say edge a h1 and h2 okay so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
how to say edge a h1 and h2 okay so
first<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.079> pair<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.750> so

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
first you have to find to a pair and so

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
first you have to find to a pair and so
then<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.110> example<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:46.190> forget<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> name<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
then for example of forget the name of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
then for example of forget the name of
the<00:00:48.090> edges<00:00:48.360> okay<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:50.070> part

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the edges okay so then we have one part

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.770 
the edges okay so then we have one part
of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> edge<00:00:50.760> clear<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> one

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of the edge clear right here and one

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
of the edge clear right here and one
part<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> edge<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
part of the edge here right here this in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
part of the edge here right here this in
this<00:00:54.600> case<00:00:54.840> green<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> orange<00:00:56.149> green<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this case green and orange green and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.380 
this case green and orange green and
orange<00:00:58.219> now<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.489> two<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.120> paired

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
orange now these two have to be paired

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.410 
orange now these two have to be paired
up<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.399> used<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.000> breaking

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
up now to do that it's used for breaking

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
up now to do that it's used for breaking
restore<00:01:03.750> Prince<00:01:03.930> wolf<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.710> i<00:01:04.739> call

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
restore Prince wolf that's what i call

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
restore Prince wolf that's what i call
it<00:01:05.720> what<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it what is the what you have to do is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
it what is the what you have to do is
you<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.280> match<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.390> match<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.630> up

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you have to match it up you match it up

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.240 
you have to match it up you match it up
you<00:01:10.560> bring<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.210> down<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.500> down

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you bring this down here so this down

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
you bring this down here so this down
here

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
here

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.429 
here
in<00:01:17.130> cases<00:01:17.399> in<00:01:17.670> ceda<00:01:17.909> I'll<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.079> again

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
in cases in ceda I'll do that again

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
in cases in ceda I'll do that again
let's<00:01:20.340> find<00:01:20.520> another<00:01:20.670> edge<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
let's find another edge here and this it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
let's find another edge here and this it
could<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.020> done<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.560> side<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.829> these<00:01:26.220> two

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
could be done on this side so these two

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450 
could be done on this side so these two
right<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.979> principle

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
right here and what this this principle

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
right here and what this this principle
does<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.450> massive<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> bring

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
does is a massive these two and bring

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.899 
does is a massive these two and bring
this<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:34.649> is<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.789> be

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
this down here which is have to be

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.300 
this down here which is have to be
unsolved<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.720> solved<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.009> if

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
unsolved if it's solved like this if

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.639 
unsolved if it's solved like this if
it's<00:01:38.520> salt<00:01:38.789> it'll<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> break<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
it's salt it'll just break it up so

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's salt it'll just break it up so
again<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.240> has<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.020> principle<00:01:43.979> brain

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
again this has to this principle brain

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
again this has to this principle brain
mapp<00:01:44.850> solve<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> bring<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.350> here

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
mapp solve this and bring this down here

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.930 
mapp solve this and bring this down here
so<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.610> two<00:01:49.280> matchup<00:01:50.899> bring<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.759> tuck<00:01:53.759> away

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
so these two matchup bring up tuck away

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.059 
so these two matchup bring up tuck away
and<00:01:54.360> s<00:01:55.220> bring<00:01:56.220> back<00:01:56.459> down<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> restore<00:01:58.069> now

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
and s bring back down and restore now

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.510 
and s bring back down and restore now
let's<00:01:59.520> find<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> other<00:02:00.090> edges<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.720> do<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
let's find the other edges and do the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.430 
let's find the other edges and do the
same<00:02:02.520> thing

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.890 

uh-huh<00:02:09.130> there's<00:02:09.520> one<00:02:09.790> right<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.210> again<00:02:10.750> it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
uh-huh there's one right here again it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.950 
uh-huh there's one right here again it
can<00:02:11.020> be<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.780> put<00:02:13.780> one

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
can be right here so then put one

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.140 
can be right here so then put one
unsolved<00:02:14.380> edge<00:02:14.650> right<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.420> break<00:02:16.800> bring<00:02:17.800> up

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
unsolved edge right here break bring up

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.990 
unsolved edge right here break bring up
tuck<00:02:19.150> away<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.810> F<00:02:20.110> bring<00:02:21.100> back<00:02:21.280> down<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
tuck away and F bring back down and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.260 
tuck away and F bring back down and
restore<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:25.420> will<00:02:25.630> repeat<00:02:25.990> with<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.740> rest

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
restore and we will repeat with the rest

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
this and this to be solved so we'll use

the break in the store principle this is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.680 
the break in the store principle this is

bring back down restore again will

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.110 
bring back down restore again will
repeat<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.750> these<00:03:28.750> two<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.880> is

bring up tuck away bring down the store

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.800 
bring up tuck away bring down the store
and<00:03:38.769> these<00:03:39.769> two<00:03:40.040> are<00:03:40.390> offset<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.480> each<00:03:41.599> other

and these two are offset of each other

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.180 
and these two are offset of each other
so<00:03:42.170> again<00:03:42.409> we'll<00:03:42.590> do<00:03:42.739> li<00:03:43.220> f<00:03:43.849> you<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.840> L<00:03:45.560> F<00:03:46.519> and

so again we'll do li f you I L F and
this<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.489> unsolved<00:03:50.890> so<00:03:51.890> we'll<00:03:52.099> put<00:03:52.760> right<00:03:53.150> here

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
this is unsolved so we'll put right here
