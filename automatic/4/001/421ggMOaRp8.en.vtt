00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810 

I'm<00:00:00.570> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.840> do<00:00:01.050> another<00:00:01.709> video<00:00:01.979> on<00:00:02.220> setting

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
I'm going to do another video on setting

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.420 
I'm going to do another video on setting
up<00:00:03.060> emulation<00:00:03.780> station<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.589> retroarch<00:00:05.310> on

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
up emulation station and retroarch on

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.270 
up emulation station and retroarch on
windows<00:00:06.200> one<00:00:07.200> reason<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
windows one reason for this is the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.580 
windows one reason for this is the
download<00:00:08.760> page<00:00:09.000> for

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
download page for

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.540 
download page for
retroarch<00:00:10.590> looks<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:10.980> bit<00:00:11.160> different

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
retroarch looks a little bit different

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700 
retroarch looks a little bit different
and<00:00:11.759> retroarch<00:00:12.240> itself<00:00:12.599> actually<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.410> got<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and retroarch itself actually just got a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.369 
and retroarch itself actually just got a
really<00:00:13.920> big<00:00:14.190> update<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> also<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.109> I've

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
really big update and also I think I've

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.950 
really big update and also I think I've
made<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> little<00:00:17.190> bit<00:00:17.340> simpler<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.060> set<00:00:18.869> up

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
made it a little bit simpler to set up

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890 
made it a little bit simpler to set up
the<00:00:19.080> configuration<00:00:19.260> file<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.010> way<00:00:20.480> it's<00:00:21.480> you

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the configuration file that way it's you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.480 
the configuration file that way it's you
know<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.619> easier<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> lot<00:00:23.430> faster

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
know just a lot easier and a lot faster

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
know just a lot easier and a lot faster
to<00:00:23.880> set<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> want<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to set up so the first thing you want to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.120 
to set up so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.760> download<00:00:27.720> emulation<00:00:28.470> station<00:00:28.560> from

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
do is download emulation station from

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.030 
do is download emulation station from
the<00:00:29.189> emulation<00:00:29.789> station<00:00:30.330> website<00:00:31.040> download

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the emulation station website download

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030 
the emulation station website download
the<00:00:32.250> Installer<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.469> I've<00:00:34.469> already<00:00:34.620> done<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the Installer and I've already done that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
the Installer and I've already done that
so<00:00:35.100> let<00:00:35.430> me<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.850> ahead<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> open<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.450> make

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
so let me go ahead and open that up make

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.420 
so let me go ahead and open that up make
sure<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> boxes<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.950> checked<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
sure all the boxes are checked so that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.920 
sure all the boxes are checked so that
you<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.170> visual<00:00:40.170> C++<00:00:40.890> pack<00:00:41.719> okay<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you get the visual C++ pack okay and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
you get the visual C++ pack okay and
then<00:00:43.050> once<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.530> done<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.280> ahead<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
then once that is done go ahead and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
then once that is done go ahead and
opened<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.170> emulation<00:00:46.950> station<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> you'll

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
opened up emulation station and you'll

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
opened up emulation station and you'll
get<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.969> error<00:00:48.149> message<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.020> reason<00:00:49.289> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
get an error message but the reason we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.700 
get an error message but the reason we
do<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.629> generate<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.989> systems

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
do that is just to generate the systems

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
do that is just to generate the systems
configuration<00:00:53.010> file<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> go

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
configuration file and then if you go

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
download the cores so to download the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.589 
download the cores so to download the
cores<00:03:05.400> you're<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.849> do<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> same<00:03:06.360> thing

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
cores you're going to do the same thing

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.350 
cores you're going to do the same thing
with<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.739> stable<00:03:08.099> folder<00:03:08.459> then<00:03:09.090> we're<00:03:09.239> going

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
with the stable folder then we're going

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.020 
with the stable folder then we're going
to<00:03:09.390> click<00:03:09.540> archive<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:11.370> stable<00:03:11.819> and

system<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.170> then<00:03:16.859> go<00:03:17.069> ahead<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
system you have and then go ahead and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.240 
system you have and then go ahead and
download<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:18.030> cores<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:19.440> once<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.100> have

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
download the cores so once you have

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.309 
download the cores so once you have
those<00:03:20.609> downloaded<00:03:21.269> they<00:03:22.260> are<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.040> zip<00:03:23.549> files

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
those downloaded they are just zip files

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.190 
those downloaded they are just zip files
so<00:03:25.319> all<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.489> need<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.849> do<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:28.010> open<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.430> the

so all you need to do is open up the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.039 
so all you need to do is open up the
retroarch<00:03:31.200> zip<00:03:31.739> file<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.870> we're<00:03:33.870> actually

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
retroarch zip file and we're actually

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.970 
retroarch zip file and we're actually
going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:35.030> create<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.180> new<00:03:36.540> folder<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.290> our<00:03:37.650> dot

emulation station folder called systems

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.390 
emulation station folder called systems
and<00:03:42.200> inside<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.530> we're<00:03:44.069> going<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.280> make

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
and inside of there we're going to make

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.460 
and inside of there we're going to make
a<00:03:44.430> folder<00:03:44.790> called<00:03:45.620> retroarch<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.780> then<00:03:48.780> copy

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.720 
of those files into the retroarch folder
ok<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.109> once<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.010> retroarch

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
ok and once the the retroarch

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.670 
ok and once the the retroarch
files<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.419> extracted<00:04:01.079> we're<00:04:01.290> going<00:04:01.470> to

retroarch<00:04:16.919> looks<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.810> because<00:04:18.810> you'll

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
retroarch looks like because you'll

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.390 
retroarch looks like because you'll
notice<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.469> it<00:04:19.590> looks<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:20.039> little<00:04:20.159> bit

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
notice that it looks a little bit

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.129 
notice that it looks a little bit
different<00:04:20.760> than<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:20.969> did<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.450> my<00:04:21.659> last

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
different than it did in my last

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.360 
different than it did in my last
this<00:04:22.979> was<00:04:23.159> a<00:04:23.189> major<00:04:23.520> update<00:04:24.889> but<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.009> doesn't

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
this was a major update but it doesn't

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.029 
this was a major update but it doesn't
really<00:04:26.639> have<00:04:27.060> an<00:04:27.419> effect<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.500> if<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.949> are

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
really have an effect on you if you are

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.450 
really have an effect on you if you are
going<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.550> be<00:04:29.699> using<00:04:30.180> emulation<00:04:31.110> station<00:04:31.460> but

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
going to be using emulation station but

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.100 
going to be using emulation station but
it<00:04:33.210> does<00:04:33.599> look<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:34.110> lot<00:04:34.289> better<00:04:34.469> so<00:04:34.919> if<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:36.150> if

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
it does look a lot better so if you if

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.409 
it does look a lot better so if you if
you<00:04:37.800> are<00:04:37.949> interested<00:04:38.129> in<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.789> using<00:04:39.150> retro

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
you are interested in just using retro

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.300 
you are interested in just using retro
work<00:04:39.569> as<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> front<00:04:40.110> end<00:04:40.259> it<00:04:40.469> actually<00:04:40.919> looks

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
work as a front end it actually looks

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.749 
work as a front end it actually looks
really<00:04:41.370> good

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
really good

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.080 
really good
in<00:04:41.969> my<00:04:42.090> opinion<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:42.689> anyway<00:04:43.729> that<00:04:44.729> was<00:04:44.759> just<00:04:44.879> a

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
in my opinion but anyway that was just a

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.140 
in my opinion but anyway that was just a
big<00:04:45.240> part<00:04:45.509> of<00:04:45.719> the<00:04:46.020> retro<00:04:46.439> work<00:04:46.590> update<00:04:47.150> so

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
big part of the retro work update so

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.010 
big part of the retro work update so
once<00:04:48.419> we<00:04:48.750> are<00:04:48.780> done<00:04:49.469> with<00:04:50.479> putting<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.719> cores

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
once we are done with putting the cores

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.360 
once we are done with putting the cores
and<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.379> retroarch<00:04:53.159> into<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:54.000> folder<00:04:54.389> arm

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
and the retroarch into that folder arm

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.559 
and the retroarch into that folder arm
you're<00:04:56.370> pretty<00:04:56.639> much<00:04:56.789> good<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> go

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
you're pretty much good to go

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.749 
you're pretty much good to go
the<00:04:58.110> only<00:04:58.229> thing<00:04:58.469> you<00:04:58.590> need<00:04:58.800> is<00:04:59.069> roms<00:04:59.400> which

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
the only thing you need is roms which

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.399 
the only thing you need is roms which
I'm<00:04:59.879> just<00:04:59.909> going<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.240> copy<00:05:00.479> my<00:05:00.599> roms<00:05:00.960> right<00:05:01.289> in

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
I'm just going to copy my roms right in

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.480 
I'm just going to copy my roms right in
there<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:03.659> you'll<00:05:03.779> see<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:03.990> named<00:05:04.349> them<00:05:04.590> just

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
there and you'll see I named them just

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.570 
there and you'll see I named them just
kind<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.729> how<00:05:05.879> the<00:05:05.939> short<00:05:06.779> name<00:05:06.930> was<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:08.370> was

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
kind of how the short name was this was

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.730 
kind of how the short name was this was
me<00:05:08.759> just<00:05:09.000> testing<00:05:09.419> something<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:12.379> if<00:05:13.379> you<00:05:13.529> look

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
me just testing something so if you look

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.879 
me just testing something so if you look
here<00:05:13.770> we're<00:05:14.340> going<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.520> pull<00:05:15.029> up<00:05:15.180> NES<00:05:15.659> and<00:05:15.930> it

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
here we're going to pull up NES and it

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.920 
here we're going to pull up NES and it
says<00:05:17.129> right<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.909> path<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.509> dot

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
says right here that the path is dot

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.550 
says right here that the path is dot
emulation<00:05:19.349> station<00:05:19.620> roms<00:05:20.279> NES<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.259> is

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
emulation station roms NES so that is

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.679 
emulation station roms NES so that is
what<00:05:23.099> I<00:05:23.129> named<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:23.849> you're<00:05:24.360> going<00:05:24.449> to<00:05:24.539> want

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
what I named it and you're going to want

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.329 
what I named it and you're going to want
to<00:05:24.719> follow<00:05:24.990> those<00:05:25.860> same<00:05:26.250> file<00:05:27.150> naming<00:05:27.479> scheme

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
to follow those same file naming scheme

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.879 
to follow those same file naming scheme
schemes<00:05:29.339> them<00:05:29.610> unless<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.509> want<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.229> redo

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
schemes them unless you want to redo

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.309 
schemes them unless you want to redo
your<00:05:32.210> configuration<00:05:33.210> file<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.839> can<00:05:33.960> organize

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
your configuration file you can organize

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.839 
your configuration file you can organize
your<00:05:34.379> files<00:05:34.650> however<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.159> want<00:05:35.400> this<00:05:35.580> is<00:05:35.669> kind

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
your files however you want this is kind

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.820 
your files however you want this is kind
of<00:05:35.909> just<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.289> jumping-off<00:05:37.289> point<00:05:37.680> you'll

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
of just a jumping-off point you'll

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.519 
of just a jumping-off point you'll
notice<00:05:38.129> that<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:38.520> really<00:05:39.060> only<00:05:39.240> put<00:05:39.479> like<00:05:39.690> seven

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
notice that I really only put like seven

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.680 
notice that I really only put like seven
or<00:05:40.650> eight<00:05:40.800> different<00:05:41.400> systems<00:05:42.240> in<00:05:42.509> the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
or eight different systems in the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.610 
or eight different systems in the
configuration<00:05:43.169> file<00:05:44.599> because<00:05:45.599> I<00:05:45.719> figured<00:05:46.050> you

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
configuration file because I figured you

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.129 
configuration file because I figured you
can<00:05:46.800> really<00:05:47.129> I<00:05:47.159> mean<00:05:47.430> retroarch<00:05:48.419> can<00:05:48.629> handle<00:05:48.930> I

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
can really I mean retroarch can handle I

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.850 
can really I mean retroarch can handle I
think<00:05:49.830> like<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.009> hundred<00:05:50.430> different<00:05:50.580> system<00:05:51.150> so

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
think like a hundred different system so

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.159 
think like a hundred different system so
it'd<00:05:52.860> be<00:05:53.639> a<00:05:53.849> very<00:05:54.120> long<00:05:54.330> file<00:05:54.629> just<00:05:54.900> to<00:05:54.990> put<00:05:55.139> a

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
it'd be a very long file just to put a

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.629 
it'd be a very long file just to put a
hundred<00:05:55.319> systems<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.039> most<00:05:56.189> people<00:05:56.520> aren't

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
hundred systems that most people aren't

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.929 
hundred systems that most people aren't
going<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.879> use<00:05:56.909> so<00:05:57.620> if<00:05:58.620> there<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.520> something

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 
going to use so if there is something

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.170 
going to use so if there is something
that<00:06:00.389> you<00:06:00.539> want<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:01.080> use<00:06:01.289> that's<00:06:01.560> not<00:06:01.800> in<00:06:01.949> there

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
that you want to use that's not in there

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.450 
that you want to use that's not in there
it's<00:06:03.180> it's<00:06:03.449> pretty<00:06:04.080> easy<00:06:04.259> to<00:06:04.439> follow<00:06:05.069> this

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
it's it's pretty easy to follow this

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.670 
it's it's pretty easy to follow this
this<00:06:05.849> pattern<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:07.080> put<00:06:07.650> your<00:06:07.800> own<00:06:07.969> your<00:06:08.969> own

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
this pattern to put your own your own

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.439 
this pattern to put your own your own
emulators<00:06:10.680> in<00:06:10.830> there<00:06:10.979> so<00:06:11.849> now<00:06:12.060> that<00:06:12.120> we<00:06:12.330> have

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
emulators in there so now that we have

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.510 
emulators in there so now that we have
all<00:06:12.479> that<00:06:12.719> setup<00:06:13.080> I'll<00:06:13.500> open<00:06:13.860> up<00:06:13.949> emulation

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
all that setup I'll open up emulation

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.570 
all that setup I'll open up emulation
station<00:06:14.930> it's<00:06:15.930> going<00:06:15.960> to<00:06:16.110> want<00:06:16.319> to<00:06:16.439> set<00:06:17.430> up<00:06:17.460> my

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
station it's going to want to set up my

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.059 
station it's going to want to set up my
gamepad<00:06:18.300> which<00:06:18.569> I'm<00:06:18.719> just<00:06:18.750> using<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.500> keyboard

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
gamepad which I'm just using a keyboard

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.460 
gamepad which I'm just using a keyboard
right<00:06:20.129> now

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.520 

and<00:06:26.820> we<00:06:27.820> have<00:06:28.060> a<00:06:28.420> few<00:06:28.750> different<00:06:28.870> systems<00:06:29.380> in

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
and we have a few different systems in

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.850 
and we have a few different systems in
here

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
here

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.790 
here
and<00:06:30.030> I'm<00:06:31.030> just<00:06:31.330> going<00:06:31.540> to<00:06:31.750> pull<00:06:31.930> up<00:06:31.960> NES<00:06:32.470> as<00:06:32.680> an

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
and I'm just going to pull up NES as an

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.370 
and I'm just going to pull up NES as an
example<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:35.350> opens<00:06:35.740> up<00:06:35.860> just<00:06:35.920> like<00:06:36.280> that

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
example and it opens up just like that

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.250 
example and it opens up just like that
I'll<00:06:38.380> hit<00:06:38.530> escape<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:39.040> close<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:39.550> then<00:06:39.610> if<00:06:40.260> you

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
I'll hit escape to close and then if you

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.710 
I'll hit escape to close and then if you
close<00:06:41.500> the<00:06:41.800> emulator<00:06:42.490> it'll<00:06:42.820> it'll<00:06:43.300> open<00:06:43.420> back

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
close the emulator it'll it'll open back

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.540 
close the emulator it'll it'll open back
up<00:06:43.960> that's<00:06:44.590> all<00:06:44.710> it<00:06:44.860> takes<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.190> setup

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
up that's all it takes to setup

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.640 
up that's all it takes to setup
emulation<00:06:46.180> station<00:06:46.300> with<00:06:46.720> retroarch<00:06:47.230> if<00:06:47.410> you

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650

actually<00:07:01.600> I<00:07:01.630> already<00:07:01.870> have<00:07:02.200> it<00:07:02.410> in<00:07:02.650> these<00:07:02.860> in

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
actually I already have it in these in

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.030 
actually I already have it in these in
this<00:07:03.280> configuration<00:07:04.030> file<00:07:04.300> so<00:07:04.410> it<00:07:05.410> really

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
this configuration file so it really

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.910 
this configuration file so it really
should<00:07:06.310> should<00:07:06.880> be<00:07:06.970> simple<00:07:07.360> if<00:07:08.320> you've<00:07:08.620> seen

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
should should be simple if you've seen

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.980 
should should be simple if you've seen
my<00:07:09.100> other<00:07:09.130> videos<00:07:09.820> on<00:07:10.060> setting<00:07:10.330> up<00:07:10.420> emulation

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990

station<00:07:11.380> with<00:07:11.500> retroarch<00:07:12.040> these<00:07:12.790> are<00:07:12.970> really

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
station with retroarch these are really

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.080 
station with retroarch these are really
similar<00:07:13.810> videos<00:07:14.140> I<00:07:14.440> really<00:07:15.220> just<00:07:15.490> wanted<00:07:15.910> to

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
similar videos I really just wanted to

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.180 
similar videos I really just wanted to
make<00:07:16.420> this<00:07:16.690> configuration<00:07:17.170> file<00:07:17.710> setup<00:07:18.100> a

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
make this configuration file setup a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.100 
make this configuration file setup a
little<00:07:18.400> bit<00:07:18.520> simpler<00:07:18.820> and<00:07:19.150> then<00:07:19.660> you<00:07:20.020> know

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
little bit simpler and then you know

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.840 
little bit simpler and then you know
with<00:07:20.290> the<00:07:20.500> retroarch<00:07:21.160> download<00:07:21.610> page

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850 
with the retroarch download page

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.510 
with the retroarch download page
