I don't know about 60 seconds but yeah
it<00:02:08.769> did<00:02:09.009> not<00:02:09.130> take<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> long<00:02:09.670> time<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.269> style

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
it did not take a long time to style

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.110 
it did not take a long time to style
this<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:11.049> as<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.830> saw<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> clip<00:02:12.610> before

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
this up as you saw in the clip before

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.890 
this up as you saw in the clip before
this<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.319> says<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.799> safe<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.900> 350

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
this so it says it's safe up to 350

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.810 
this so it says it's safe up to 350
degrees<00:02:17.290> Fahrenheit<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.099> guess<00:02:18.310> any<00:02:18.579> hotter

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
degrees Fahrenheit so I guess any hotter

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.900 
degrees Fahrenheit so I guess any hotter
than<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.570> your<00:02:20.019> unit<00:02:20.410> will<00:02:20.620> burn<00:02:21.100> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
than that and your unit will burn the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.509 
than that and your unit will burn the
style<00:02:22.299> of<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.720> unit<00:02:23.109> is<00:02:23.260> called<00:02:23.530> Lisa<00:02:24.070> and

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
style of this unit is called Lisa and

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.690 
style of this unit is called Lisa and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
again it's dr v g that is the color and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.500 
again it's dr v g that is the color and
it's<00:02:27.910> 100%<00:02:28.510> premium<00:02:29.500> fiber<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:31.090> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
it's 100% premium fiber so this is not a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.069 
it's 100% premium fiber so this is not a
human<00:02:32.470> hair<00:02:32.680> wig<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:33.579> basically<00:02:34.209> jump
