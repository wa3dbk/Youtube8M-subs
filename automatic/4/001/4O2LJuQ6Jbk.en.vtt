you have to you know get used to and
whatnot<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:23.970> compose<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.110> all

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
whatnot we go to compose you have all

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.350 
whatnot we go to compose you have all
your<00:02:25.709> different<00:02:28.280> preset<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.430> messages<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
your different preset up messages so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
your different preset up messages so
like<00:02:30.659> if<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.110> press<00:02:31.379> one<00:02:31.500> empty<00:02:31.920> relay

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
like if you just press one empty relay

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.949 
like if you just press one empty relay
let's<00:02:32.549> say<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.209> only<00:02:33.329> have<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.690> fill<00:02:33.840> out

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
let's say you only have to fill out

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.569 
let's say you only have to fill out
certain<00:02:34.260> fields<00:02:34.860> all<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.190> rest<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
certain fields all the rest of the

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.130 
certain fields all the rest of the
writings<00:02:35.879> in<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.569> don't<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.959> to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
writings in there so you don't have to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
writings in there so you don't have to
fill<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.670> fill<00:02:38.849> out<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
fill that out just have to fill out the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.660 
fill that out just have to fill out the
individual<00:02:39.629> fields<00:02:40.069> makes<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.370> easier

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
individual fields makes it much easier

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.819 
individual fields makes it much easier
for<00:02:43.129> sending<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.220> messages<00:02:44.640> all<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.970> so

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
for sending the messages all right so

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.930 
for sending the messages all right so
let's<00:02:46.829> get<00:02:46.920> back<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.519> why<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
let's get back to this so why is the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.680 
let's get back to this so why is the
Qualcomm<00:02:48.500> important<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:50.459> necessarily<00:02:50.690> for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
Qualcomm important not necessarily for

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.509 
Qualcomm important not necessarily for
you<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:51.959> an<00:02:52.079> individual<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.890> not<00:02:53.040> an<00:02:53.160> expense

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
you as an individual it's not an expense

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.430 
you as an individual it's not an expense
that<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.390> spend<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.959> that's<00:02:55.170> good

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that you have to spend so that's good

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.530 
that you have to spend so that's good
thing<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.859> lot<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.670> companies<00:02:57.090> are<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.450> to

there's different types out there's a
couple<00:03:00.659> different<00:03:01.010> manufacturers<00:03:02.010> Qualcomm

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
couple different manufacturers Qualcomm

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.059 
couple different manufacturers Qualcomm
is<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.690> solid<00:03:04.349> on<00:03:04.440> happens<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.890> use

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
is the one that solid on happens to use

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
I said different types there's older

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.619 
I said different types there's older
versions<00:03:10.079> newer<00:03:10.260> versions<00:03:11.209> like<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.329> can<00:03:12.510> see

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
versions newer versions like you can see

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
important need response ASAP at the very

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.420 
important need response ASAP at the very
beginning<00:05:19.710> because<00:05:19.950> that's<00:05:20.100> what<00:05:20.250> they<00:05:20.370> see

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
beginning because that's what they see

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.400

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
sub screen and then they can determine

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.029 
sub screen and then they can determine
whether<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.020> message<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.470> important<00:05:25.889> or<00:05:25.979> not

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
whether the message is important or not

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.320 
whether the message is important or not
right<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.699> needs<00:05:27.500> immediate<00:05:28.500> attention

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
right and needs immediate attention

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
right and needs immediate attention
that's<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.419> big<00:05:30.570> thing<00:05:30.750> so<00:05:30.780> get<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.200> know<00:05:31.229> your

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350

can<00:06:38.289> get<00:06:38.470> into<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.800> system<00:06:39.009> and<00:06:39.340> can<00:06:39.550> find<00:06:39.879> it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
can get into the system and can find it

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.520 
can get into the system and can find it
it<00:06:40.210> may<00:06:40.360> take<00:06:40.389> a<00:06:40.599> little<00:06:40.810> bit<00:06:40.960> but<00:06:41.020> they<00:06:41.289> can

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
it may take a little bit but they can

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.390 
it may take a little bit but they can
find<00:06:41.800> it<00:06:42.009> okay<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:42.909> it<00:06:43.870> can<00:06:44.139> be<00:06:44.289> a<00:06:44.319> saver<00:06:44.860> also

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
find it okay so it can be a saver also

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.939 
find it okay so it can be a saver also
for<00:06:45.669> you<00:06:45.789> Henry<00:06:46.569> that's<00:06:47.110> it<00:06:47.349> that's<00:06:47.500> all<00:06:47.710> the
