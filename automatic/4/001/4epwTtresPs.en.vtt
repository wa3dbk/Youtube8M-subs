00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.060
 so I want to show you how to get one 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.160
 guitar tunes without tuning one gets one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.980
 are those situations, there is often one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 it done on a celebration it says in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.250
 play it but no tuning devices 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 the guitar totally upset if he 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 Of course now paying to play alone 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 Shall it be just important that the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 guitar in you right you go 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 as follows 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.210
 You take a base take the basic tone 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 the bottom of the page ok that's one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 basis and then agreed one now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.890
 whole vital and that step by step 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.829
 first the e string then the side g 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.200
 Sit side by side and be like that 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 that is a basic sound is that now 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.260
 study the note de on the page 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.150
 it is the fifth point in this case 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.230
 now you have to belong not you 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.400
 means you compare these two tones 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.040
 I always do that so I get that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.470
 to put the reason and on a level and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.470
 then he is the next sound either 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.830
 at the top or bottom level 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 underneath that is if if you you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.210
 downstairs then you have to open the sound 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:26.759
 the same level is okay 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.390
 so i have the guitar is natural 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.390
 already determined 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.780
 so now you have two tones the voices 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.840
 the h page and the page now it works 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.500
 to the next to the page you are looking for 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 now the note h on the b page is in 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.180
 this case the fourth and and now 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.180
 compares the b page by hand 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.979
 Now you have three pages that stand 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.960
 Now you go on the idea side there 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.289
 the note g is the fifth in this case 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.289
 Federation 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 now you have four sides of the mood 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.100
 Now you go to the a side and sit down 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.380
 there the note d 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.890
 also in this case the five birth 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.890
 compare this 2 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.600
 as I said if the sound is something so high 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.270
 is from the a side 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.880
 kanzian the mechanics simply the Danube 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.740
 something understated 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.770
 Now comes the last page of the e- string 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.530
 because you are looking for now on the side of the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.640
 note aaa because you just with the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 a-side needs to compare 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.620
 so fits now 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.240
 so again very briefly are 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 all routes on in the fifth and yes up 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.350
 on the b-side in the g string is that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.510
 it is the fourth reason and always stepping 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.680
 is by step the bottom side side 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.250
 a base note then you search on the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.910
 a-side the note compares these two 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.130
 grades 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:29.490
 which is on the b-side to the harmless 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:34.500
 two months then the meeting under 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:41.420
 on the b side and then the dots on 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:44.070
 the a side and the poverty on the e be 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.990
 It also takes a bit of practice here 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.459
 to stop make your belonging owe 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.810
 but how many times have you done this exercise 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.040
 the faster will be able 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.640
 agree a guitar without tuner 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.640
 just try it
