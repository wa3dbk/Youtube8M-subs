00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.569
 I am a little depressed right now 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.749
 for that it will unfold not wanted it is always necessary to count his dreams 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.179
 to get better 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.710
 if anyone knows about dream interpretation has reported 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.259
 because there I do not think it's really what's happening in 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.259
 my subconscious 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.779
 for February 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.169
 you know I was surrounded by dancers a parade was dressed in 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.629
 rose of course made them after 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 one moment 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 Miss France has arrived 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.150
 lt and dance in the plate of couscous 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
