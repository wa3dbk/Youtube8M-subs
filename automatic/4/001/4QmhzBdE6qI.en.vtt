00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
updates however they won't have them as

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.750 
updates however they won't have them as
complicated<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.809> they<00:00:40.929> are<00:00:41.050> on<00:00:41.289> PC<00:00:41.890> he<00:00:42.550> also

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
complicated as they are on PC he also

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.630 
complicated as they are on PC he also
doesn't<00:00:43.149> even<00:00:43.449> give<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:44.019> general<00:00:44.469> idea<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.370> when

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
doesn't even give a general idea of when

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.590 
doesn't even give a general idea of when
they<00:00:45.789> would<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.059> out<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.480> in<00:00:47.409> recent<00:00:47.649> weeks<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
they would be out and in recent weeks I

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.660 
they would be out and in recent weeks I
guess<00:00:50.050> you<00:00:50.170> could<00:00:50.199> say<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.920> developers<00:00:51.519> have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
guess you could say the developers have

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.459 
guess you could say the developers have
really<00:00:51.969> showed<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.420> strong<00:00:52.690> dislike<00:00:53.109> for

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
really showed a strong dislike for

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.340 
really showed a strong dislike for
having<00:00:54.129> commands<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:54.940> command<00:00:55.899> related

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
having commands and command related

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.099 
having commands and command related
items<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.429> wouldn't<00:00:57.850> expect<00:00:58.239> commands<00:00:58.809> to

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
items so I wouldn't expect commands to

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.770 
items so I wouldn't expect commands to
be<00:00:59.260> out<00:00:59.409> any<00:00:59.710> time<00:01:00.280> soon<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:01.239> same<00:01:01.510> thing<00:01:01.539> goes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
be out any time soon the same thing goes

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.289 
be out any time soon the same thing goes
for<00:01:01.989> command<00:01:02.589> blocks<00:01:02.859> because<00:01:03.460> this<00:01:03.909> question

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
for command blocks because this question

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.830 
for command blocks because this question
was<00:01:04.449> asked<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.130> the<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.549> devs<00:01:07.149> responded

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
was asked and the the devs responded

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.499 
was asked and the the devs responded
saying<00:01:08.439> no<00:01:09.280> they<00:01:09.520> do<00:01:09.579> not<00:01:09.700> plan<00:01:10.119> on<00:01:10.149> adding

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
saying no they do not plan on adding

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.679 
saying no they do not plan on adding
command<00:01:11.020> blocks<00:01:11.320> any<00:01:11.590> time<00:01:11.860> soon<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:13.000> commands

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
command blocks any time soon so commands

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.289 
command blocks any time soon so commands
and<00:01:13.869> command<00:01:14.320> blocks<00:01:14.590> won't<00:01:14.950> come<00:01:15.219> least<00:01:16.000> for

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
and command blocks won't come least for

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.499 
and command blocks won't come least for
a<00:01:16.329> while<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.890> next<00:01:18.280> bit<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.490> news<00:01:18.610> was<00:01:19.180> for

1.0<00:01:33.670> arm<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.869> did<00:01:35.259> have<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.979> few<00:01:36.310> videos<00:01:36.609> in<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
1.0 arm I did have a few videos in the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.170 
1.0 arm I did have a few videos in the
past<00:01:37.180> about<00:01:37.539> skins<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.909> developers<00:01:39.909> keep

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
past about skins and developers keep

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.599 
past about skins and developers keep
pushing<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.659> back<00:01:41.070> mainly<00:01:42.070> because<00:01:42.100> there's

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
pushing it back mainly because there's

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.999 
pushing it back mainly because there's
complications<00:01:43.000> with<00:01:43.539> skin<00:01:43.990> problems<00:01:44.619> likely

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
complications with skin problems likely

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.870 
complications with skin problems likely
not<00:01:45.159> skin<00:01:45.429> problem<00:01:45.789> for<00:01:45.909> like<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
not skin problem for like the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.700 
not skin problem for like the
verification<00:01:48.880> system<00:01:49.390> with<00:01:49.780> mojang<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.500> it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
verification system with mojang and it's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.499 
verification system with mojang and it's
pretty<00:01:51.429> complicated<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.240> they're<00:01:52.390> having

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
pretty complicated so they're having

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.469 
pretty complicated so they're having
some<00:01:52.840> issues<00:01:53.170> with<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.310> same<00:01:55.119> thing<00:01:55.359> with

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
some issues with it so same thing with

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.510 
some issues with it so same thing with
skins<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.079> wouldn't<00:01:56.409> expect<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.859> for<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> while

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
skins I wouldn't expect that for a while

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.899 
skins I wouldn't expect that for a while
either<00:01:57.939> because<00:01:58.479> they<00:01:58.840> seem<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.350> be<00:01:59.530> having

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
either because they seem to be having

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.599 
either because they seem to be having
some<00:01:59.999> problems<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:02.130> next<00:02:02.460> week

mode<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.519> doesn't<00:02:35.879> seem<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.150> it's

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
mode but that doesn't seem like it's

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.289

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
Jeb and this person asks if Tom added

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.720 
Jeb and this person asks if Tom added
game<00:02:52.079> mode<00:02:52.260> switching<00:02:52.799> because<00:02:53.400> he<00:02:53.549> did

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
game mode switching because he did

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.759 
game mode switching because he did
promise<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.239> during<00:02:54.810> one<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.170> live<00:02:55.349> streams

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
promise that during one the live streams

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.490 
promise that during one the live streams
and<00:02:56.010> Deb<00:02:56.790> says<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.299> he<00:02:57.450> hasn't<00:02:57.660> added<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.290> yet

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and Deb says that he hasn't added it yet

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.460 
and Deb says that he hasn't added it yet
but<00:02:59.099> he<00:02:59.459> believes<00:03:00.299> he<00:03:00.629> will<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:01.170> he<00:03:01.319> did

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
but he believes he will because he did

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.729 
but he believes he will because he did
promise<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:02.750> hopefully<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:04.139> is<00:03:04.410> some

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
promise it so hopefully there is some

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.410 
promise it so hopefully there is some
sort<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.040> button<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.549> allows<00:03:05.639> us<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:06.150> switch

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
sort of button that allows us to switch

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.379 
sort of button that allows us to switch
game<00:03:06.660> modes<00:03:06.900> however<00:03:07.940> we<00:03:08.940> shouldn't<00:03:09.269> really

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
game modes however we shouldn't really

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.509 
game modes however we shouldn't really
expect<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.200> 0.9<00:03:10.709> point<00:03:10.920> 0<00:03:11.160> because

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
expect this in 0.9 point 0 because

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.910 
expect this in 0.9 point 0 because
sometimes<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.750> developers<00:03:13.260> run<00:03:13.440> out<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.620> time

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
sometimes the developers run out of time

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.240 
sometimes the developers run out of time
to<00:03:14.190> add<00:03:14.340> stuff<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.940> things<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.079> they<00:03:16.260> expect

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
to add stuff and things that they expect

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.759 
to add stuff and things that they expect
to<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.579> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> update<00:03:18.239> wind<00:03:18.900> up<00:03:19.079> not<00:03:19.260> being<00:03:19.319> in

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to be in the update wind up not being in

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.190 
to be in the update wind up not being in
there<00:03:19.950> at<00:03:20.099> all<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.579> game<00:03:21.299> mode<00:03:21.540> switching<00:03:22.079> is

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
there at all so game mode switching is

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.539 
there at all so game mode switching is
something<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:22.829> really<00:03:23.190> shouldn't

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
something that we really shouldn't

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.030 
something that we really shouldn't
expect<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.090> geopoint<00:03:24.389> 9.0<00:03:25.049> but<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.859> does

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
expect in geopoint 9.0 but if it does

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.120 
expect in geopoint 9.0 but if it does
come<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.639> will<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.880> really<00:03:27.090> nice<00:03:27.239> surprise

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
come it will be a really nice surprise
