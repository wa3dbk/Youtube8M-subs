demonstration<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.300> did<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.380> damage<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
demonstration I did I kind of damage the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.290 
demonstration I did I kind of damage the
edge<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.550> touched<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.060> up

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
edge a little bit so I touched this up

degrees inclusive the way I conducted

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
degrees inclusive the way I conducted
this<00:00:55.350> demonstration<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.510> got<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.780> baseline

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
this demonstration I got some baseline

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470 
this demonstration I got some baseline
by<00:00:58.530> cutting<00:00:58.949> several<00:00:59.550> pieces<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.059> rope<00:01:00.210> with

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
by cutting several pieces of rope with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
by cutting several pieces of rope with
each<00:01:00.629> blade<00:01:00.989> measured<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> downward<00:01:02.399> force

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
each blade measured the downward force

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
each blade measured the downward force
required<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.449> through<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> Rope<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
required to get through the Rope then I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
required to get through the Rope then I
performed<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> harder<00:01:05.820> cut<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:07.049> intended

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
performed a harder cut that was intended

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
performed a harder cut that was intended
to<00:01:07.619> dull<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> edges<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.330> mark

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to dull the edges a little bit I mark

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.830 
to dull the edges a little bit I mark
the<00:01:10.200> edges<00:01:10.380> before<00:01:11.090> find<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.299> example<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the edges before find a good example and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.520 
the edges before find a good example and
mark<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> edges<00:01:13.350> before<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.340> did<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> cut<00:01:15.659> then

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
mark the edges before I did the cut then

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.570 
mark the edges before I did the cut then
I<00:01:16.799> conducted<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> cut<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.900> see

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
I conducted the cut and as you can see

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
I conducted the cut and as you can see
the<00:01:20.580> marks<00:01:20.880> worn<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.689> area<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the marks worn off in this area here so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
the marks worn off in this area here so
after<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> hard<00:01:24.090> cut<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.600> went<00:01:24.840> back<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
after I did the hard cut I went back to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
after I did the hard cut I went back to
the<00:01:25.229> rope<00:01:25.409> made<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.040> rope<00:01:26.280> cuts<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the rope made some more rope cuts and I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980 
the rope made some more rope cuts and I
did<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.610> several<00:01:29.610> spots<00:01:29.780> several<00:01:30.780> points

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
did so in several spots several points

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.730 
did so in several spots several points
along<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.979> area<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.180> would<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.740> potentially

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
along the area that would be potentially

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.179 
along the area that would be potentially
impacted<00:01:35.700> by<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> harder<00:01:36.390> cut<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.009> what<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
impacted by the harder cut and what this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
impacted by the harder cut and what this
hopefully<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.060> show<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.799> how<00:01:40.799> much

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
hopefully will show is how much

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.359 
hopefully will show is how much
degradation<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.500> edges<00:01:43.979> from

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
degradation we see to these edges from

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.480 
degradation we see to these edges from
performing<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> cut<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.979> intention<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
performing a cut that the intention of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.039 
performing a cut that the intention of
it<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> thought<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> looked<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.780> pretty

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it was I thought it looked like a pretty

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.679 
it was I thought it looked like a pretty
hard<00:01:49.380> impressive<00:01:50.100> cut<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:51.000> far<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.360> an

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
hard impressive cut as far as an

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.859 
hard impressive cut as far as an
everyday<00:01:51.990> task<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.869> one

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
everyday task would go I think it's one

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
everyday task would go I think it's one
of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> harder<00:01:55.320> tasks<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> might<00:01:56.189> perform

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
of the harder tasks that I might perform

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.510 
of the harder tasks that I might perform
in<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> day<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.680> cut<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> keep

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
in a day but it's just one cut so keep

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.450 
in a day but it's just one cut so keep
that<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.759> mind<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.899> test<00:02:01.890> without

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that in mind this is not a test without

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
that in mind this is not a test without
limitations<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.170> demonstration

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
limitations it's just a demonstration

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.419 
limitations it's just a demonstration
got<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> tire<00:02:05.490> marked<00:02:05.939> off<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.429> patch

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
got the tire marked off with a patch

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.630 
got the tire marked off with a patch
slightly<00:02:09.360> longer<00:02:09.629> than<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> knife<00:02:10.640> figured

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
slightly longer than the knife figured

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.030 
slightly longer than the knife figured
that's<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.879> pretty<00:02:12.060> reasonable<00:02:12.270> scale

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's a pretty reasonable scale

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:28.330 
that's a pretty reasonable scale
everyone<00:02:14.469> here<00:02:15.469> we<00:02:15.590> go<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.950> it's<00:02:28.069> fairly

for<00:05:43.730> these<00:05:44.180> cutting<00:05:44.600> tests<00:05:45.139> if<00:05:45.350> you<00:05:45.530> want<00:05:45.680> to

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
for these cutting tests if you want to

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.110 
for these cutting tests if you want to
call<00:05:45.889> them<00:05:45.950> tests<00:05:46.370> they're<00:05:46.610> just<00:05:46.639> kind<00:05:47.060> of

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
call them tests they're just kind of

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.440 
call them tests they're just kind of
subjective<00:05:47.419> cuts<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.970> certainly<00:05:49.970> this<00:05:50.210> has

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
subjective cuts and certainly this has

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.390 
subjective cuts and certainly this has
all<00:05:50.720> kinds<00:05:51.110> of<00:05:51.169> limitations<00:05:51.800> so<00:05:51.980> I<00:05:52.010> don't<00:05:52.250> want

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
all kinds of limitations so I don't want

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.080 
all kinds of limitations so I don't want
to<00:05:52.960> pontificate<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.500> act<00:05:55.280> all<00:05:55.490> scientific

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
to pontificate and act all scientific

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.840 
to pontificate and act all scientific
because<00:05:56.960> this<00:05:57.169> is<00:05:57.320> just<00:05:57.550> cutting<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.639> side

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
because this is just cutting the side

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.200 
because this is just cutting the side
out<00:05:59.030> of<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.180> tire<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:01.100> semi<00:06:01.430> stock<00:06:01.700> edge<00:06:01.940> which

out of a tire the semi stock edge which

out of a tire the semi stock edge which
was<00:06:02.389> touched<00:06:02.780> up<00:06:02.990> on<00:06:03.169> a<00:06:03.200> sharp<00:06:03.530> maker<00:06:03.820> and

was touched up on a sharp maker and

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.450 
was touched up on a sharp maker and
improved<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.330> from<00:06:05.540> over<00:06:05.750> 4<00:06:05.990> pounds<00:06:06.169> to<00:06:06.500> 3.6

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
improved it from over 4 pounds to 3.6

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.640 
improved it from over 4 pounds to 3.6
pounds<00:06:07.700> to<00:06:08.000> cut<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.300> rope<00:06:08.480> after<00:06:09.290> it<00:06:09.380> cut<00:06:09.560> the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
pounds to cut the rope after it cut the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.450 
pounds to cut the rope after it cut the
tire<00:06:09.860> I<00:06:10.100> did<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:10.639> should<00:06:11.360> back<00:06:11.540> up<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:11.930> did<00:06:12.460> three

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
tire I did I should back up I did three

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.360 
tire I did I should back up I did three
tests<00:06:14.150> on<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.600> edge<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:15.139> to<00:06:15.710> kind<00:06:15.889> of<00:06:16.040> get<00:06:16.190> at

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
tests on this edge to to kind of get at

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.340 
tests on this edge to to kind of get at
the<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.970> variability<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.780> edge<00:06:18.020> because

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
the the variability in the edge because

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.770 
the the variability in the edge because
obviously<00:06:19.100> I<00:06:19.460> didn't<00:06:19.820> cut<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:20.060> tire<00:06:20.479> with

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
obviously I didn't cut the tire with

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.290 
obviously I didn't cut the tire with
just<00:06:21.050> one<00:06:21.320> tiny<00:06:21.590> piece<00:06:21.889> of<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.250> edge<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.790> used<00:06:23.000> a

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
just one tiny piece of the edge I used a

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.629 
just one tiny piece of the edge I used a
little<00:06:24.020> bit<00:06:24.260> of<00:06:24.470> the<00:06:24.620> edge<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.010> so<00:06:25.190> I<00:06:25.220> tried<00:06:25.520> to

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
little bit of the edge and so I tried to

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.730 
little bit of the edge and so I tried to
do<00:06:25.790> a<00:06:25.820> couple<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:26.479> rope<00:06:26.660> cuts<00:06:26.930> along<00:06:27.260> the<00:06:27.440> area

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
do a couple of rope cuts along the area

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.140 
do a couple of rope cuts along the area
where<00:06:27.889> I<00:06:27.919> thought<00:06:28.340> most<00:06:28.760> of<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:28.970> cutting

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
where I thought most of the cutting

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.140 
where I thought most of the cutting
occurred<00:06:30.160> so<00:06:31.160> those<00:06:31.340> numbers<00:06:31.370> ranged<00:06:32.030> from

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
occurred so those numbers ranged from

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.870 
occurred so those numbers ranged from
four<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:32.630> four<00:06:32.840> point<00:06:33.050> two<00:06:33.229> pounds<00:06:33.700> that's<00:06:34.700> the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
four to four point two pounds that's the

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.480 
four to four point two pounds that's the

2.82<00:06:49.360> anywhere<00:06:50.360> from<00:06:50.450> three<00:06:50.810> to<00:06:50.840> 3.2<00:06:51.500> pounds

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
2.82 anywhere from three to 3.2 pounds

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.890 
2.82 anywhere from three to 3.2 pounds
so<00:06:52.370> the<00:06:52.700> edge<00:06:52.850> degraded<00:06:53.450> a<00:06:53.510> little<00:06:53.720> bit<00:06:53.810> on

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
so the edge degraded a little bit on

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.490 
so the edge degraded a little bit on
that<00:06:53.930> too<00:06:54.350> with<00:06:54.590> this<00:06:54.740> cut<00:06:56.169> finally<00:06:57.169> the

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
that too with this cut finally the

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.250 
that too with this cut finally the
purple<00:06:57.950> knife<00:06:58.100> which<00:06:58.430> is<00:06:58.700> a<00:06:59.000> 10<00:06:59.840> degree<00:06:59.990> per

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
purple knife which is a 10 degree per

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.450 
purple knife which is a 10 degree per
side<00:07:00.530> 20<00:07:00.950> degree<00:07:01.220> inclusive<00:07:01.760> polished<00:07:02.510> blade

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
side 20 degree inclusive polished blade

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.060 
side 20 degree inclusive polished blade
it<00:07:04.460> went<00:07:04.729> from<00:07:04.910> my<00:07:05.150> two<00:07:05.479> point<00:07:05.750> O<00:07:05.930> pounds<00:07:06.919> of

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
it went from my two point O pounds of

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.390 
it went from my two point O pounds of
force<00:07:07.220> to<00:07:07.340> cut<00:07:07.550> throat<00:07:07.789> before<00:07:08.410> too<00:07:09.410> depending

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
force to cut throat before too depending

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.040 
force to cut throat before too depending
on what<00:07:10.880> portion<00:07:11.240> of<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.389> blade<00:07:11.600> we<00:07:11.780> test

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
on what portion of the blade we test

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.529 
on what portion of the blade we test
anywhere<00:07:12.740> from<00:07:12.830> two<00:07:13.070> to<00:07:13.100> 2.4<00:07:13.970> pounds<00:07:14.210> after

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
anywhere from two to 2.4 pounds after

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:17.830 
anywhere from two to 2.4 pounds after
and<00:07:15.370> then<00:07:16.370> I<00:07:16.700> did<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:16.970> big<00:07:17.180> cut<00:07:17.419> at<00:07:17.539> the<00:07:17.570> end

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
and then I did the big cut at the end

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.710 
and then I did the big cut at the end
where<00:07:18.410> we<00:07:18.440> cut<00:07:19.430> the<00:07:19.550> entire<00:07:19.850> side<00:07:20.180> wall<00:07:20.419> out<00:07:20.600> of

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
where we cut the entire side wall out of

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.110 
where we cut the entire side wall out of
the<00:07:20.780> tire<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.260> we<00:07:21.860> degraded<00:07:22.310> it<00:07:22.430> further<00:07:22.700> from

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
the tire and we degraded it further from

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.560 
the tire and we degraded it further from
perhaps<00:07:23.630> 2.4<00:07:24.380> all<00:07:24.680> the<00:07:25.190> way<00:07:25.280> down<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.570> three

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
perhaps 2.4 all the way down to three

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.360 
perhaps 2.4 all the way down to three
pounds<00:07:27.080> of<00:07:27.169> force<00:07:27.380> with<00:07:28.160> the<00:07:28.669> 10<00:07:28.910> degree<00:07:29.180> knife
