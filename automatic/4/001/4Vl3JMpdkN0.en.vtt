00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:54.619 

on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> side<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> speak<00:00:52.219> then<00:00:53.449> I'm<00:00:54.449> going

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
on the side of the speak then I'm going

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
on the side of the speak then I'm going
to<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.780> ahead<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:57.230> look<00:00:58.230> carefully<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:59.039> going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to go ahead and look carefully I'm going

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
to go ahead and look carefully I'm going
to<00:00:59.219> color<00:00:59.460> his<00:00:59.699> entire<00:01:00.059> body<00:01:00.300> white<00:01:00.949> you'll

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to color his entire body white you'll

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
to color his entire body white you'll
see<00:01:02.129> why<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> watch<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.780> videos<00:01:04.350> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
see why if you watch my other videos you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
see why if you watch my other videos you
heard<00:01:04.799> me<00:01:04.979> tell<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> difference<00:01:05.610> between

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
heard me tell you the difference between

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
heard me tell you the difference between
glossy<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> reason<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.799> also<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
glossy the reason I do this also is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
glossy the reason I do this also is
because<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> white<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.810> smudges

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
because when the white kind of smudges

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
because when the white kind of smudges
is<00:01:10.590> move<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.030> smooth<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
is move this out then smooth out the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.289 
is move this out then smooth out the
details<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> everything<00:01:14.820> will<00:01:14.880> seem<00:01:15.030> more

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
details so everything will seem more

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
details so everything will seem more
realistic<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.500> color<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> why<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
realistic so you just color the why is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.899 
realistic so you just color the why is
the<00:01:17.670> direction<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.270> wearing<00:01:18.689> clothes<00:01:18.900> hair

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
the direction of wearing clothes hair

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.499 
the direction of wearing clothes hair
did<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.970> look<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> too<00:01:21.540> far<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:23.509> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
did you look that too far down and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
did you look that too far down and
everything<00:01:24.750> comes<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.409> smooth<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:27.420> looks

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
everything comes so smooth that it looks

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.710 
everything comes so smooth that it looks
even<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:27.869> realistic<00:01:35.030> try<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.479> color

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
even more realistic try it out to color

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
even more realistic try it out to color
on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> black<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
on the black because it's going to you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.109 
on the black because it's going to you
don't<00:01:38.909> want<00:01:39.030> too<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.360> black<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.380> you're

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
don't want too much black when you're

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
don't want too much black when you're
placing<00:01:42.119> risen<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> white<00:01:42.899> areas<00:01:43.820> just

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
placing risen to the white areas just

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
placing risen to the white areas just
enough<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> extra

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
enough so that when you do for the extra

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.460 
enough so that when you do for the extra
black<00:01:47.430> hole<00:01:47.670> right

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
black hole right

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.190 
black hole right
it<00:01:49.160> will<00:01:49.280> have<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.430> blocky<00:01:49.670> effect<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.050> that's

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it will have a blocky effect and that's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.540 
it will have a blocky effect and that's
what<00:01:51.290> I'm<00:01:51.440> trying<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.710> say<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:52.040> now<00:01:54.550> now

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
what I'm trying to say right now now

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.460 
what I'm trying to say right now now
because<00:01:55.970> my<00:01:56.180> outline<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:56.840> black<00:01:57.140> if<00:01:57.380> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
want to take a little ear they'll figure

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.469 
want to take a little ear they'll figure
out<00:02:04.640> too<00:02:06.580> i'm<00:02:07.580> going<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.820> add<00:02:07.940> another<00:02:08.090> color

outline<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.750> let's<00:02:12.020> see<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:15.380> color

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
outline to it and let's see that color

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.560 
outline to it and let's see that color
outline<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.640> going<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.150> lightish

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
you're just going to do it's not going

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150 
you're just going to do it's not going
to<00:02:23.240> be<00:02:23.360> too<00:02:23.780> obvious<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.590> i'm<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.920> put

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to be too obvious but i'm going to put

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010 
to be too obvious but i'm going to put
steadily<00:02:25.850> around<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> outline<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.750> my

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
steadily around the outline of my

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.900 
steadily around the outline of my
character<00:02:27.500> i'm<00:02:28.190> going<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> add<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:28.670> new

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
character i'm going to add this new

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.370 
character i'm going to add this new
color<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.740> that's<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.070> second<00:02:31.490> outline

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
color so that's like a second outline

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.360 
color so that's like a second outline
you're<00:02:33.380> not<00:02:33.470> gonna<00:02:33.560> put<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.860> inside<00:02:34.190> just

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
you're not gonna put on the inside just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.310 
you're not gonna put on the inside just
so<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> outline<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.390> out<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.900> perimeter

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
so the outline the out of the perimeter

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:46.160 
so the outline the out of the perimeter
of<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.970> drawing

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.080 

you<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.319> have<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.829> do<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.129> but<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.849> don't

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
you don't have to do this but I don't

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.610 
you don't have to do this but I don't
want<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.299> black<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.659> get<00:02:49.780> lost<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.260> everything

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
want the black to get lost in everything

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:03.929
