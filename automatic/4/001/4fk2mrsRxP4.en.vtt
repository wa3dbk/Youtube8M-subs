 not only in this magical health market of the 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.360
 the channel is obvious there and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.540
 but it's making a video here for 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.410
 complementary and covering the greater 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.780
 public 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.340
 so people after the movie 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.980
 saying that I'm really into a 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:50.260
 tumor in the spine found the worst 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.960
 way is so good 14 bearable already go 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.210
 be the point already located more to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.130
 I had my doctor do the surgery. 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 I had indicated that I should look for a 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.760
 doctor 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.950
 we got indications just like that and that 's what I 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 I went with directions I had no plan 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.740
 health it then surgery would be 50,000 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.450
 from then he indicated he had another 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.350
 I to health 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.929
 and there was no plan for health that I 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.929
 I have to put as dependent of the line 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.170
 I do not know, and summary is a benign tumor. 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:31.090
 It's just that it's really complicated if you took 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.039
 day on the day the guy said explained 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.039
 talk then I gave you good luck, right? 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.909
 it was a lot 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.039
 My mother accompanies me on the day because 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.279
 we can handle the business unit 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.409
 and I just looked at her, yes, because that 

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.270
 because it's not just the fourth games 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.759
 being unlucky in life is also an element 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.759
 what was left for me does not say what 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.819
 attracts so that has a lucky me 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.569
 I'm only here in mexico was portugal was 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.569
 very bad luck even 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.529
 is very large that even there spoke for years 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.140
 at least five years has been growing and 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:09.340
 There was no way I came up that you do not have 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.730
 fault 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.860
 and neither is it difficult to imagine that a 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.360
 business of 21 12 in another language would not 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.270
 arrive and stay here with this pain 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.260
 that should be a tumor is better 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 and even daudt hornela violently not 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.400
 had a lot to do and the surgery 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.050
 only problem that the commune will have it has 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 the outside has the inside part 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.040
 of the column that is going to have to cut 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.770
 on the other to take of trying this is the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.960
 more complicated and probably more 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.120
 you may need to go back in the column 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.040
 Sort things up 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.470
 although the film to be praised 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.450
 we are strong here is how it is 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.850
 and talent is saying that the posture 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.340
 and then maybe because of that I do not 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.080
 that's what I need to ask 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.580
 for you became waiting now the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.510
 authorization of the health plan to make 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.810
 the surgery 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.100
 We already did the x-ray and such has to do 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.180
 a blood test and get the authorization 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.850
 of the cardiologist 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.980
 but the main one is waiting for peace 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.530
 authorize surgery 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.410
 In the meantime I'm still a lot and 2 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.510
 taking direct medication not sleeping 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.970
 because they can not position themselves since 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.890
 that this business that does not agree with 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.460
 pain is what is being more 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.170
 interesting is the night is the day time 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.310
 computer and almost did not sleep 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.580
 sony medication and cause 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.190
 This makes it very difficult to record today. 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.650
 I have no record, there are days I have 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.290
 to record to sleep in the middle of the recording 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.720
 Sunday then vote alert and that's what 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.190

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.530
 always trying to get a 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.900
 video when I get on the boat and 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.850
 after surgery will have recovery and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.570
 after the recent return with everything here in 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.810
