00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.490
 Look-can if they sell 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:14.950
 I will talk about how to grow poinsettia this time 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:18.189
 Images of Christmas tend to be strongly regarded as representatives of winter plants 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.600
 Poinsettia but in fact surprisingly 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.430
 Origin is Mexico 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:32.320
 It is a plant that is not very strong in the cold 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 In that the will wither is black from the leaves of previous exposure to taste 10 degrees or less of the Lake Japan 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:43.850
 During the winter Let's grown in, such as the windowsill of indoor plenty of date hit 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.120
 In addition, because poinsettia is vulnerable to excessive humidity 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.410
 Grow slightly dry throughout the year 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:00.790
 After watering, the surface of the soil is completely dry 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.989
 The next Cub when I was dried to a longitude that does not feel the close force try to put a finger in the value 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.500
 Do not take 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:15.380
 It would be good to lift the end and give it water 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 Winter is dormant and growth slows down, so it is safe to do without fertilizer until spring 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.549
 You can grow outdoors from spring to autumn 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.600
 When it is time for the cherry blossoms to bloom , put 8 outside 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:39.290
 Let's cut back about half the stock and do the meeting 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:42.050
 In addition, poinsettia is a short-day plant and it is red for the first time when daylight hours are short and cost is low 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:49.330
 It is a plant that is colored 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:55.480
 If So the next year to buy also you want to enjoy the color red to the time of Christmas 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:02:01.740
 From September from every evening until the next morning over to around November 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:09.989
 It would be good if you put 2 years old in your house and put some processing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 Depending on the temperature, but began coloring in red 50 days as + and leaves from 40 days to continue this work 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.070
 More 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 Poinsechi Ya that will liven up the Christmas mood 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.230
 Please try to grow you
