00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
departments of university that teach

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.220 
departments of university that teach
computing<00:00:17.220> one<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> my<00:00:18.930> department

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
computing one is my department

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.599 
computing one is my department
information<00:00:20.130> systems<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.550> operations

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
information systems and operations

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.660 
information systems and operations
management<00:00:20.970> another<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> computer<00:00:22.500> science

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
management another is computer science

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.640 
management another is computer science
another<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.820> software<00:00:24.269> engineering<00:00:24.750> now

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
another one is software engineering now

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.040 
another one is software engineering now
why<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.570> teach

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
why we are different is that we teach

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
why we are different is that we teach
both<00:00:29.390> information<00:00:30.390> technology<00:00:30.859> but<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
both information technology but in a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
both information technology but in a
business<00:00:33.000> setting<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.960> teach<00:00:34.170> information

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
business setting so we teach information

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
business setting so we teach information
systems<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> business<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.390> those<00:00:36.989> two

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
systems and business and those two

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.010 
systems and business and those two

subjects we're teaching content and
topics<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:58.289> technology<00:00:59.070> what's<00:00:59.579> really

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
topics about technology what's really

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
topics about technology what's really
important<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.449> days<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.199> students<00:01:01.559> to

have what's called a competition called

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
have what's called a competition called
spark<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.200> people<00:01:31.799> from

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
spark and that is where people from

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
spark and that is where people from
actually<00:01:32.400> around<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> university<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually around the university in a
