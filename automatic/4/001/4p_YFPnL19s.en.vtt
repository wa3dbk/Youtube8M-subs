there and cutting off and then you'll
have<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:28.199> diamond<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.090> then<00:00:30.090> after<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
have your diamond so then after this

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.400 
have your diamond so then after this
we're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.969> bass

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
we're going to make a can like bass

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.020 
we're going to make a can like bass
right<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> fold<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
right there so we're going to fold it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
right there so we're going to fold it
like<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:39.770> then<00:00:40.770> we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> turn

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
like that and then we're going to turn

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.500 
like that and then we're going to turn
it<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> fold<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:46.219> corners<00:00:47.219> on

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
it this way and fold these corners on

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
it this way and fold these corners on
today<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> top<00:00:50.370> edge<00:00:50.640> lines<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
today so the top edge lines with the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
today so the top edge lines with the
center<00:00:53.899> just<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:58.530> welcome<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
center just like this then welcome to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.810 
center just like this then welcome to
unfold<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.410> two<00:01:01.710> creases<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
unfold those now have two creases I can

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.160 
unfold those now have two creases I can
so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> should<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.600> something<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.080> looks

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so you should have something that looks

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.789 
so you should have something that looks
like<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.619> arrow<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.960> gonna<00:01:07.080> open

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
like an arrow and then you're gonna open

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:20.270 
like an arrow and then you're gonna open
up<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.979> tuck<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.400> fit<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:19.280> you're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
up this bit and tuck this fit in you're

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.859 
up this bit and tuck this fit in you're
going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> same<00:01:21.799> with<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> other<00:01:24.500> side

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
going to do the same with the other side

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.319 
going to do the same with the other side
so<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:29.549> should<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.320> kite<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.179 

and<00:01:36.329> after<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.770> you've<00:01:37.920> got<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and after you so when you've got this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.660 
and after you so when you've got this
kite<00:01:38.840> you're<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:40.020> fault<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:42.229> edges

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
kite you're gonna fault these edges

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270 
kite you're gonna fault these edges
inter<00:01:44.670> send<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.180> make<00:01:45.390> sure<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.200> fold<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> nice

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
inter send to make sure you fold it nice

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
inter send to make sure you fold it nice
and<00:01:47.670> crisp<00:01:48.259> micra<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.619> fold<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> other

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and crisp micra and then fold the other

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.510 
and crisp micra and then fold the other
one<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> center<00:01:51.899> both<00:01:52.619> layers<00:01:52.979> then

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
one on to the center both layers then

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.249 
one on to the center both layers then
you're<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> run<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:55.110> you're

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you're going to run that then you're

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.100 
you're going to run that then you're
going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> keep<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.920> folded<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> bit

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.980 

and<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> fold<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.509> tip

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and then you're going to fold this tip

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.619 
and then you're going to fold this tip
down<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.600> tell<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:07.550> this<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:09.030> folder<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
down and tell this this your folder and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.270 
down and tell this this your folder and
exactly<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.619> corner<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.250> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.920 

then<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.940> once<00:02:18.150> you've<00:02:18.300> done<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.780> should

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
then so once you've done that you should

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.230 
then so once you've done that you should
have<00:02:18.960> an<00:02:19.170> isosceles<00:02:19.530> triangle<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:21.060> you're

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
have an isosceles triangle then you're

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.380 
have an isosceles triangle then you're
going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> unfold<00:02:21.630> these<00:02:22.730> three<00:02:23.730> folds<00:02:24.270> like

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
going to unfold these three folds like

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.840 
going to unfold these three folds like
that<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.320> should<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.910> marks<00:02:27.690> made

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
that and you should have the marks made

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.830 
that and you should have the marks made
then<00:02:29.850> we're<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.270> something<00:02:30.600> similar

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
then we're going to do something similar

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
then we're going to do something similar
to<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.230> petal<00:02:31.560> fold<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.220> what<00:02:32.670> we're<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
to the petal fold so what we're going to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
to the petal fold so what we're going to
do<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.300> we're<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.570> pull<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.840> flap<00:02:34.440> up

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
do is we're going to pull this flap up

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.750 
do is we're going to pull this flap up
here<00:02:35.600> onto<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:37.320> crease<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.490> made<00:02:38.730> with

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
here onto that crease that we made with

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.110 
here onto that crease that we made with
that<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.590> tuck<00:02:42.470> flaps<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:44.120> see

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that point and then tuck flaps in see

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.420 
that point and then tuck flaps in see
I've<00:02:45.270> done<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.810> there<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.250> can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
I've done one there and then you can

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.600 
I've done one there and then you can
just<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> same<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.160> other<00:02:50.190> side

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
just do the same with the other side

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.580 
just do the same with the other side
this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.000> easy<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> flat<00:02:52.080> surface

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
this is easy to do in flat surface

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
this is easy to do in flat surface
that's<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:53.040> I'm<00:02:53.130> doing<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.520> my<00:02:53.640> desk<00:02:56.900> so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
that's what I'm doing it on my desk so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.900 
that's what I'm doing it on my desk so
once<00:02:58.230> you've<00:02:58.470> done<00:02:58.830> she<00:02:59.550> looks<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
once you've done she looks like this and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.120 
once you've done she looks like this and
then<00:03:03.090> you're<00:03:03.210> gonna<00:03:03.330> do<00:03:03.570> turn<00:03:04.050> over<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.920> do

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
then you're gonna do turn over and do

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.270 
then you're gonna do turn over and do
the<00:03:05.280> same<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:06.540> pull<00:03:06.780> up<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.830> should<00:03:08.070> see

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the same so pull up and you should see

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:33.360 
the same so pull up and you should see
them<00:03:08.520> start<00:03:08.970> suckin<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:45.270 

and<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:35.600> have<00:03:35.810> them<00:03:36.110> you're<00:03:36.830> um<00:03:37.840> base<00:03:38.840> thing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.530 

there<00:03:46.280> are<00:03:46.370> loads<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.820> different<00:03:47.000> things<00:03:47.390> you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
there are loads of different things you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.120 
there are loads of different things you
can<00:03:47.660> meet<00:03:47.840> with<00:03:47.960> this<00:03:48.140> way<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.500> hair<00:03:48.800> in<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
can meet with this way the hair in the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.020 
can meet with this way the hair in the
hummingbird<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.810> we're<00:03:51.380> making<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:53.510> squid

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
hummingbird but we're making the squid

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:03.940 
hummingbird but we're making the squid
so<00:03:56.030> what<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.630> need<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.990> do<00:03:57.200> now<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:59.980> we<00:04:00.980> need<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
so what we need to do now is we need to

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.380 
so what we need to do now is we need to
fold<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:05.000> first<00:04:05.480> flap<00:04:06.260> up<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.210> should

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
fold this first flap up so you should

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.520 
fold this first flap up so you should
have<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.540> very<00:04:08.900> very<00:04:09.290> very<00:04:09.470> thin<00:04:10.220> dymond<00:04:11.530> just

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
have a very very very thin dymond just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:23.680 
have a very very very thin dymond just
like<00:04:12.770> here<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:14.230> then<00:04:15.230> you're<00:04:15.440> going<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:22.690> so

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
like here and then you're going to so

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:34.710 
like here and then you're going to so
then<00:04:24.080> you're<00:04:24.320> gonna<00:04:24.670> fold<00:04:25.670> this<00:04:25.760> tip<00:04:26.690> up<00:04:26.900> here

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.140 

and<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.040> you're<00:04:37.040> going<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.280> fold<00:04:37.460> these<00:04:37.760> two

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
and then you're going to fold these two

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.630 
and then you're going to fold these two
bits<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.750> here<00:04:39.320> like<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.950> done<00:04:42.430> then<00:04:43.430> once

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
bits in here like I have done then once

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.390 
bits in here like I have done then once
you've<00:04:43.820> done<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:45.410> can<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.800> lap<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.250> up

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
you've done that you can this lap it up

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.890 
you've done that you can this lap it up
a<00:04:46.669> bit<00:04:46.700> but<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:50.150> that's<00:04:50.450> going<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.780> be

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
a bit but so and that that's going to be

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.409 
a bit but so and that that's going to be
the<00:04:51.140> eye<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.919> our<00:04:52.130> squid<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:53.090> then<00:04:53.270> you're

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
the eye of our squid so then you're

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.530 
the eye of our squid so then you're
going<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.600> fold<00:04:53.980> cut<00:04:54.980> these<00:04:55.370> edges<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.450> the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
going to fold cut these edges on to the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.420 
going to fold cut these edges on to the
center<00:04:59.290> so<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.740> these<00:05:00.919> are<00:05:01.100> gonna<00:05:01.190> be<00:05:01.310> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
center so and these are gonna be the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:25.930 
center so and these are gonna be the
tentacles

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.590 

so<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.240> should<00:05:27.720> also<00:05:27.870> looks<00:05:29.240> just<00:05:30.240> like

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
so now you should also looks just like

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.890 
so now you should also looks just like
an<00:05:31.410> arrow<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:33.060> then<00:05:33.270> we're<00:05:33.420> going<00:05:33.540> to<00:05:33.630> cut

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
an arrow and then we're going to cut

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.550 
an arrow and then we're going to cut
along<00:05:34.170> this<00:05:34.770> sense<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:36.270> along<00:05:36.540> these<00:05:36.900> a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
along this sense of it and along these a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.900 
along this sense of it and along these a
very<00:05:38.160> edge<00:05:38.370> bit<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:40.560> need<00:05:40.800> scissors<00:05:43.910> and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
very edge bit so you need scissors and

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:54.350 
very edge bit so you need scissors and
you're<00:05:45.180> going<00:05:45.420> to<00:05:46.100> cut<00:05:47.100> along<00:05:49.550> yeah<00:05:53.210> should<00:05:54.210> I

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
you're going to cut along yeah should I

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:04.760 
you're going to cut along yeah should I
do<00:05:55.140> now<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:57.090> then<00:05:57.240> you're<00:05:57.420> gonna<00:05:57.570> cut<00:06:03.770> and

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
just going to fold these down up put

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.120 
just going to fold these down up put
behind<00:07:09.680> the<00:07:10.680> head<00:07:11.370> bit<00:07:12.470> and<00:07:13.470> then<00:07:13.620> you<00:07:13.860> can

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
behind the head bit and then you can

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.519 
behind the head bit and then you can
fold<00:07:14.430> them<00:07:14.700> back<00:07:15.360> again

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529
