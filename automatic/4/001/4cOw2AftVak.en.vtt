00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
a lobby with more than 350 it was so

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.830 
a lobby with more than 350 it was so
frustrating<00:05:14.270> brown<00:05:15.270> was<00:05:15.479> pretty<00:05:15.690> much<00:05:15.750> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
frustrating brown was pretty much the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.439 
frustrating brown was pretty much the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
the screen your frame rate will drop a

the screen your frame rate will drop a
little<00:06:00.270> bit<00:06:00.509> and<00:06:00.949> it's<00:06:01.949> a<00:06:02.009> minor<00:06:02.190> annoyance

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
little bit and it's a minor annoyance

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.749 
little bit and it's a minor annoyance
it's<00:06:02.909> nothing<00:06:03.090> game<00:06:03.870> breaking<00:06:04.139> but<00:06:04.949> on<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
it's nothing game breaking but on the

positive side well for one the ps3
doesn't<00:06:07.919> have<00:06:08.039> that<00:06:08.219> much<00:06:08.490> at<00:06:08.699> all<00:06:08.900> a<00:06:09.900> little

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
doesn't have that much at all a little

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.719 
doesn't have that much at all a little
bit<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.800> does<00:06:10.949> I<00:06:10.979> mean<00:06:11.279> you're<00:06:11.400> going<00:06:11.520> to<00:06:11.580> have

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
bit it does I mean you're going to have

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.309 
bit it does I mean you're going to have
that<00:06:11.909> from<00:06:12.360> time<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:12.719> time<00:06:12.750> when<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:13.169> have<00:06:13.289> a

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
that from time to time when you have a

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.860 
that from time to time when you have a
game<00:06:13.560> this<00:06:13.830> scale<00:06:14.729> with<00:06:15.270> this<00:06:15.419> many<00:06:15.629> players

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
game this scale with this many players

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.629 
game this scale with this many players
and<00:06:16.139> this<00:06:16.259> many<00:06:16.469> explosions<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.159> stuff<00:06:17.250> it's

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
and this many explosions and stuff it's

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.980 
and this many explosions and stuff it's
just<00:06:17.849> that's<00:06:18.599> inevitable

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
just that's inevitable

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.860 
just that's inevitable
happens<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.050> bit<00:06:21.170> more<00:06:21.260> frequently<00:06:21.650> on<00:06:21.740> 360<00:06:22.870> but

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
happens a bit more frequently on 360 but

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.300 
happens a bit more frequently on 360 but
on<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.020> other<00:06:24.080> end<00:06:24.230> of<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.380> spectrum<00:06:24.470> I<00:06:24.950> think

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
on the other end of the spectrum I think

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.040 
on the other end of the spectrum I think
this<00:06:25.550> game<00:06:25.730> looks<00:06:25.940> a<00:06:26.090> little<00:06:26.210> bit<00:06:26.390> around<00:06:26.540> 360

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
this game looks a little bit around 360

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.110 
this game looks a little bit around 360
the<00:06:27.920> colors<00:06:28.250> just<00:06:28.430> seem<00:06:28.610> to<00:06:28.730> be<00:06:28.820> a<00:06:28.850> little<00:06:28.940> bit

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
the colors just seem to be a little bit

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.840 
the colors just seem to be a little bit
brighter<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.780> me<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.080> more<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:31.490> game<00:06:31.670> just

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
brighter to me and more the game just

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.460 
brighter to me and more the game just
looks<00:06:32.120> a<00:06:32.180> little<00:06:32.360> bit<00:06:32.540> clearer<00:06:32.810> which<00:06:33.290> is

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
looks a little bit clearer which is

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.750 
looks a little bit clearer which is
probably<00:06:33.740> because<00:06:34.100> it<00:06:34.220> runs<00:06:34.430> out<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.580> little

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
probably because it runs out a little

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.920 
probably because it runs out a little
bit<00:06:34.910> higher<00:06:35.090> frame<00:06:35.450> rate<00:06:35.800> overall<00:06:37.030> so<00:06:38.030> I<00:06:38.270> gets

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
bit higher frame rate overall so I gets

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.690 
bit higher frame rate overall so I gets
kind<00:06:39.140> of<00:06:39.200> an<00:06:39.290> even<00:06:39.530> trade<00:06:39.620> off<00:06:39.830> their<00:06:40.070> bar

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
kind of an even trade off their bar

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.790 
kind of an even trade off their bar
terms<00:06:41.030> of<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.210> graphics<00:06:41.600> and<00:06:41.800> graphics

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
terms of the graphics and graphics

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.940 
terms of the graphics and graphics
department<00:06:43.450> so<00:06:44.450> yeah<00:06:45.170> those<00:06:45.350> are<00:06:45.500> basically

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
department so yeah those are basically

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.460 
department so yeah those are basically
the<00:06:46.040> main<00:06:46.370> differences<00:06:46.850> I've<00:06:47.000> noticed<00:06:47.470> you'll
