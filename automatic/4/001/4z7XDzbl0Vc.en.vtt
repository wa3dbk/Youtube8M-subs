00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.219
 that if we did it ourselves at the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 hand is always a little speed 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.730
 cooking class like that bah at the beginning 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 time and respect the parents arrive 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.850
 at 4 o'clock it is necessary that the dish is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.769
 So here we have to work 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.939
 Well, you started there 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.590
 cooking class for him it's a 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.229
 passion that I have always had 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.479
 and then four years ago I decided to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 to throw me here so I typed all of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.610
 cousins ​​of my children including zachary who 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.259
 have come the presence of friends that's getting 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 pass like that I'm not too 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.200
 difficult to give cooking classes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.840
 the cousins ​​of friends I was often 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.579
 volunteer at school so that does not pose 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 problem on the contrary it is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.460
 exciting then the kids bring 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.330
