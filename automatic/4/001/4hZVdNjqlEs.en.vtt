kill it with a nice being but the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.740 
kill it with a nice being but the
encores<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
encores me right here which is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330 
encores me right here which is
interesting<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> figured<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.040> he<00:01:08.100> would<00:01:08.130> just

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
interesting I figured that he would just

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
interesting I figured that he would just
go<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.580> another<00:01:08.670> infestation<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.900> guess

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
go for another infestation but I guess

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
go for another infestation but I guess
good<00:01:10.860> play<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.100> his<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.729> he's<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
good play on his part as he's going to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
good play on his part as he's going to
go<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.170> wall<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.130> him

have me under the infestation hazard so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
have me under the infestation hazard so
I'm<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> mall<00:01:25.020> wall<00:01:25.229> right

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I'm going to go out to a mall wall right

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
I'm going to go out to a mall wall right
here<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> Intimidator<00:01:27.630> off

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
here as a I do get the Intimidator off

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.260 
here as a I do get the Intimidator off
so<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:27.930> should<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.290> able<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> live<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.950> hit

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
so i should be able to live any hit

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.359 
so i should be able to live any hit
after<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> mega<00:01:30.570> evolve<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:32.100> actually<00:01:32.189> goes

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
after I mega evolve but he actually goes

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.710 
after I mega evolve but he actually goes
for<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> substitute<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> probably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
for the substitute actually I probably

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
for the substitute actually I probably
wouldn't<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.110> been<00:01:34.200> able<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> live<00:01:34.650> any<00:01:34.799> hint

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
wouldn't have been able to live any hint

going to go for the earthquake because I
could<00:02:10.080> always<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> substitute<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.099> could

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
was not going to switch out aegislash at

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.240 
was not going to switch out aegislash at
all<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.030> he<00:03:00.150> does<00:03:00.330> go<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.660> return<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:02.130> was

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
all as he does go for return so that was

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.430 
all as he does go for return so that was
really<00:03:02.280> really<00:03:02.580> amazing<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:04.110> going<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
really really amazing so I'm going to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.250 
really really amazing so I'm going to
actually<00:03:04.860> switch<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.810> now<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.170> my

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
actually switch out and now go out to my

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.590 
actually switch out and now go out to my
Garchomp<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:09.209> don't<00:03:09.269> know<00:03:09.510> if

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
Garchomp right here and I don't know if

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.910 
Garchomp right here and I don't know if
I<00:03:09.690> had<00:03:09.810> Stella<00:03:10.080> spoke<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.470> Garchomp<00:03:10.680> at

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
I had Stella spoke on my Garchomp at

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.500 
I had Stella spoke on my Garchomp at
this<00:03:11.010> time<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.819> might<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.060> had<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.420> on

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
this time I think I might have had it on

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.330 
this time I think I might have had it on
deoxys<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.350> definitely<00:03:13.709> should<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.130> went

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
deoxys but I definitely should have went

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.820 
deoxys but I definitely should have went
out<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.550> deoxys<00:03:14.970> right<00:03:15.150> here<00:03:15.560> regardless<00:03:16.560> I

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
out to deoxys right here regardless I

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.640 
out to deoxys right here regardless I
think<00:03:17.030> because<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.329> don't<00:03:18.690> know<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.019> don't<00:03:19.410> know

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
think because I don't know I don't know

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.120 
think because I don't know I don't know
what<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:19.860> should<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.100> done<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:21.829> he<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.920> going

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
what I should have done but he is going

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.930 
what I should have done but he is going
to<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.700> go<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.530> die<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.980> my<00:03:26.340> rocky<00:03:26.700> helmet

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
to just go and die to my rocky helmet

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330 
to just go and die to my rocky helmet
rufskin<00:03:27.420> combo<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.769> we're<00:03:28.920> here<00:03:29.070> I'm<00:03:29.130> going<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
rufskin combo so we're here I'm going to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.870 
rufskin combo so we're here I'm going to
go<00:03:29.400> out<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> deoxys<00:03:30.090> because<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.750> uh<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:32.100> am

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
go out to a deoxys because I do uh I am

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.420 
go out to a deoxys because I do uh I am
going<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.480> able<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.720> live<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.430> thunderbolt

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
going to be able to live a thunderbolt

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.340 
going to be able to live a thunderbolt
if<00:03:35.549> he's<00:03:35.700> not<00:03:35.880> life<00:03:36.180> orb<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:37.079> just<00:03:37.260> wanted

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
if he's not life orb and I just wanted

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.080 
if he's not life orb and I just wanted
to<00:03:37.500> see<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:37.950> I've<00:03:38.190> naive<00:03:38.519> nature<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
to see because I've naive nature and

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
to see because I've naive nature and
there's<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.360> hundred<00:03:39.690> percent<00:03:39.750> chance<00:03:40.019> or<00:03:40.290> like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
there's a hundred percent chance or like

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.810 
there's a hundred percent chance or like
really<00:03:40.769> really<00:03:40.860> hot<00:03:41.070> chance<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:41.459> me<00:03:41.579> living

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
really really hot chance for me living

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.880 
really really hot chance for me living
its<00:03:42.510> unmodified<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.170> naive<00:03:43.320> nature<00:03:43.709> but

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
its unmodified was a naive nature but

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.830 
its unmodified was a naive nature but
unfortunately<00:03:44.489> i<00:03:44.519> am<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:45.390> right<00:03:45.540> here<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.780> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
unfortunately i am and i right here is a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800 
unfortunately i am and i right here is a
speed<00:03:46.079> type<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:46.650> i<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.190> uh<00:03:47.810> there's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
speed type but i know that uh there's

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.550 
speed type but i know that uh there's
like<00:03:49.049> an<00:03:49.260> eighty<00:03:50.160> percent<00:03:50.459> chance<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.560> him

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
like an eighty percent chance of him

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.310 
like an eighty percent chance of him
killing<00:03:52.799> me<00:03:53.070> with<00:03:53.310> Thunderbolt<00:03:54.140> but<00:03:55.140> there's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
killing me with Thunderbolt but there's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.539 
killing me with Thunderbolt but there's
also<00:03:55.470> twenty<00:03:55.859> percent<00:03:56.070> chance<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.400> him

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
also twenty percent chance of him

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.860 
also twenty percent chance of him
obviously<00:03:56.970> not<00:03:57.090> killing<00:03:57.390> me<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.750> odds

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
obviously not killing me so the odds

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.569 
obviously not killing me so the odds
were<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.049> my<00:03:58.140> favor<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.650> he<00:03:59.340> could<00:03:59.459> win

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
were in my favor because he could win

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.860 
were in my favor because he could win
the<00:03:59.670> speed<00:03:59.880> time<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.269> for<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> thunderbolt

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the speed time and go for a thunderbolt

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.240 
the speed time and go for a thunderbolt
and<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.350> would<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.650> have<00:04:01.859> been<00:04:01.890> able<00:04:02.070> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and that would not have been able to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.740 
and that would not have been able to
that<00:04:02.609> there's<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.940> possibility<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.480> him<00:04:03.540> not

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that there's a possibility of him not

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.410 
that there's a possibility of him not
going<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.290> able<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.500> knock<00:04:04.650> me<00:04:04.829> out<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.100> I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
going to be able to knock me out and I

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.310 
going to be able to knock me out and I
would<00:04:06.420> be<00:04:06.480> able<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.660> live<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.989> fire<00:04:07.140> off<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
would be able to live and fire off the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.750 
would be able to live and fire off the
thunderbolt<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.829> then<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.130> shadow<00:04:08.489> sneak

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
thunderbolt and then a shadow sneak

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.250 
thunderbolt and then a shadow sneak
would<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.239> able<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.390> knock<00:04:09.570> him<00:04:09.780> out<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.109> that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
would be able to knock him out so that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.229 
would be able to knock him out so that
was<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.380> really<00:04:10.440> really<00:04:10.709> close<00:04:10.980> game<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.459> should

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
was a really really close game I should

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.729 
was a really really close game I should
have<00:04:12.299> led<00:04:12.480> malwa<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.019> team<00:04:13.170> preview<00:04:13.500> because

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
have led malwa on team preview because

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.960 
have led malwa on team preview because
it<00:04:13.829> was<00:04:13.950> obviously<00:04:14.280> it's<00:04:14.459> gonna<00:04:14.579> lead<00:04:14.790> out

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
