00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.010
 one 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.480
 here the matter and its nine faces with 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.250
 a new part of the guide series 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.870
 for Marvel started to come will be 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.820
 good for this part let's talk about 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.289
 a question that I did not mainly have 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.730
 very planned to be due that is 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.580
 ask the speaker a little bit in what 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.690
 it was a video a long time ago it was a 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.279
 video more or less from when is 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.920
 starting is called gold keel which 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.509
 I was waiting for the record fm 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.179
 first video that I had my visits and 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.770
 they are never to forget then spoke a 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.140
 little bit about this topic but as already 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.030
 now I have more subscribers and see me more 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.350
 people and so many people always 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.360
 keep asking the same thing let's do 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.770
 a quick video and so that the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.910
 question solved and I also think 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.590
 which is a video that has to be 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.850
 the year for initiates by god because 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.290
 all newbies have to learn 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.330
 this before before they commit 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.880
 a serious but good mistake that what 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.770
 let's talk because you need to save 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.000
 Marvel gold alliance years or because no 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.070
 will be achieved in marvel avn 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.960
 yesenia good it turns out that gold is the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.400
 most important resource I'm talking to you 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.040
 of resources for getting into the subject of 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.150
 that people but good the gold is like 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 such the currency let's talk about the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.700
 currency the most important currency of love 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.900
 belani exits because cristian put 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.880
 with the command photo you can buy is 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.280
 really very important but you with your 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.650
 only until you eat you have 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.020
 heroes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 with the silver all the command points 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.370
 you get them on missions by god the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.080
 silver with jets get the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.290
 points of which the allies are but 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.420
 the gold when you get it 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.890
 only in the daily roulette very few 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.050
 times when there is a book or when 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.050
 play 1 gifted when you level up 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.150
 make it very necessary to know what you 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.430
 you are going to be first I recommend you 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.590
 save we're going to be here to start 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.780
 let's say that you are a player is level 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.090
 1 let's say that you are a level 1 and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.300
 Well, if you get 10 gold, they give you 10 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.490
 of gold 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.280
 I recommend you get to level 20 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.470
 and spend treasures on heroes that I follow 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.330
 I hit too much because I always 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.130
 I say war machine that a hero to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.210
 that is a hero that low level god 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.730
 my thing 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.280
 causes damage that will kill any 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.540
 of three friends in the pp or in playing 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.720
 against player so I recommend them 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.160
 too much but if you are a person that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 Well, he already has a lot of experience 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.570
 game and you do not need or can you win a 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 game can beat anyone with 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.380
 any hero, I recommend you 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.510
 start saving those from the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.920
 principle so good when you get there 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.210
 without gold personally I recommend you 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.970
 buy the team that did training 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.790
 and if it's not good I already had another 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.190
 video of whether it is necessary to buy the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 second that if training but I 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.760
 I commented enough for example you are level 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.220
 100 and you have your 100 gold and purchase 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.380
 that the training lavalle defined 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.420
 It will facilitate many things because if 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 see if you're obviously pretty good 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.210
 if you have enough money in case 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.250
 do not have the same talk always 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.390
 get it but it's facilitating too many 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.799
 things and I recommend you a lot 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.330
 save your gold to buy it and the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.500
 truth is that good now yes forgiveness is 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.830
 that already has a little problem here 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.890
 so now I was talking ok 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.659
 the main thing that I recommend 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.790
 buy is that although I do not have enough 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.739
 silver at the low level or for example had a 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.930
 level 100 can not have enough silver 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.909
 has 200,000 300,000 well that's not going 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.739
 to serve quite because every improvement 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.329
 it costs that my god but if it's going to 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.730
 Serve enough to have everything exceeded and 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.260
 quickly to level 7 to level 8 and that goes 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.060
 to allow is obviously very good 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.940
 bonuses so I highly recommend them 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.859
 buy the training bay but in 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.879
 hands of that you need to save a lot 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.950
 soros then to spend it on in 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.680
 the command points or points of 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.170
 skin so that it is cunning in that if it is 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.640
 if you are going to get those of any other 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.170
 what those points eat you from the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.819
 essential point instead what is the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.190
 You will not get it to good 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.109
 now let's talk about when she 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.370
 have in the training box already 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 have the treatment amount that you are going to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.030
 be you draw 200 hours from 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.680
 all levels and even more because like 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.760
 they keep giving you but we're going to take them to 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.129
 level 300 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.390
 in what is more good that there are weapons 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.780
 essential in the game for example makes 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.689
 little came out once 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:09.830
 the image was here called 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:12.170
 well it turns out that it's a weapon 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.880
 a synthetic cube we are going to give a game 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.710
 synthetic a synthetic egg is a weapon 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.170
 that was in need of facilitating many 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.620
 things although it can be something that then 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.050
 can be achieved with enough weapons 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.300
 Well obviously that's always 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.729
 but 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.220
 you will always always use everyone 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.629
 the adversaries are going to have something to 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.509
 annular of the weapon and they are already serving 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.099
 quite as soon as I recommend it 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.690
 the synthetic cube but to the device 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.240
 climate control that would be told as 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.620
 the mini synthetic cube there is also 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.409
 many other weapons that have 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.199
 pretty or even not a verb weapon 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.879
 not just a weapon for example a weapon 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.180
 to hurt already that is there are many 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.440
 weapons in the store and then help is not going 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.860
 be mainly in the second 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.139
 weapon training box from here 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.389
 the store that they are going to serve a lot or 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.039
 at the point of command but but as 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.979
 I was saying, we will follow a very high level 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.969
 low in the low level do not control what the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.539
 I recommend it's going to be like that 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:14.520
 it's necessary to save enough gold to 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.569
 so that the cows and training you what 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.400
 that there are things that are going to serve you 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.930
 too much not a few command points that 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.090
 You can simply wait about five 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.590
 battles more and you're going to get it that way 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.020
 I do not recommend it much 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.180
 only in what I just said then 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.919
 let's say we 're going to see lives here already 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.710
 there is a topic that I am going to talk about 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.270
 a lot but at last to conclude with this 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.039
 because important to save because 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.449
 just if you spend it after the 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.219
 command or simply by giving the 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.860
 roulette and all that is not going to have the 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.990
 same benefits as if for example 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.099
 you spend them on a very good weapon or what 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.930
 is in the second that if training 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.210
 It makes me recommend it a lot and 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.069
 well this forgot about suffering christ 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.379
 what else went up every auction day 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.400
 two videos and also writes topics of 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.960
 facebook and twitter 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.060
 'not eating many things out there to the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 fans of jokes everywhere my account 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.240
 of facebook and had also in the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.039
 Jesus account because lately I'm 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.419
 very active after I respond to the 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.669
 most of the comments all 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.889
 questions that make me answer and 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:14.729
 I'm always very active so 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:16.259
 here we are much more followers in what 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.669
 what is the facebook page this has 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.669
 been for this crystal skin chau
