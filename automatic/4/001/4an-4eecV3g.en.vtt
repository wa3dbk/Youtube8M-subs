00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.859
 introductory video to 1 2 0 12 an instant 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.950
 files it took a while because 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 with me fraps for some reasons 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 no longer works i have the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.060
 new graphics card so the driver new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.529
 installed and since then spectrum 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 I've come to the studio 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 concerned and the video will still 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 participate 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 yes, I already have it now 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.099
 logged in and get you now fast 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 let's see what the server files to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.730
 We have the one to offer 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.489
 reject the de style are so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 furnished as metin 2 de all shops 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.379
 then we have the costume system that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 I 'm working already 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.559
 a costume 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.000
 we can take that off again 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 any hairstyle and so on 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 just not like that is the de 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 equipment is still in the inventory and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 does not stay up here but that should 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.869
 Do not bother us you can do it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 attract 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.479
 it is not packaged and that should times 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.189
 then we have the down here 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 energy bar this works too 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.850
 perfect so both the heavy ones 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 energy crystal worried 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 I can then measure through oak 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.140
 use this energy and will be here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 then displayed below 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 we have the valley of oskar regions 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 So the devils katar I have come 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 also inserted it is not 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.590
 stern.de devils kater comes because i 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 did not find this but yes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 better than nothing here with a client 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.110
 Still the problem is the reindeer pads 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 and some other things are unfortunately 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.909
 still a little fail that means 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 now again the saws potts 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.680
 the reptiles and the pads resemble the sermons 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.980
 mocking and the nineties are weapons 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.630
 so packs the anchor's value from the moon 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.810
 sword, for example, will not be right 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.640
 displayed but not further 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.239
 I bring disturbance into the next one 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.060
 time out a client v2 and there will be 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:36.030
 then everything will be completely intact and it will be 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.970
 will work de quests on the switch 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.310
 july biologist quests and the hunting quest 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.950
 otherwise the other quest you have to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.560
 raussuchen you shut I did not 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.100
 found 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.799
 The motto is in the principle of the EU 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.420
 I have that from the current with the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.540
 So two de client extracts 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.549
 converted and then as sql file in 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:14.570
 the database inserted something in this 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:14.570
 case specifically is the mob drop is left 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 which the the etc kropp item and the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.160
 others have the other drop stuff 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.170
 I took out because many 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.680
 have complained that they are you 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 the garbage does not drip 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.780
 and so on and around the whole then stop 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.099
 to reactivate or so I have that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.180
 rouse deleted for being added as an attachment 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.670
 I have this on my test 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.370
 server already inserted here and many 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.500
 claim that they are after these 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.139
 its no longer insert drops 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.049
 connecten can work for me 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.430
 everything impeccable you can see here 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:06.579
 the common drop item is inserted 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.900
 the drop item group as ice inserts it 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:14.139
 everything works where it sits 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 also who but for example etc drop outs 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:20.380
 and that stuff works for me one 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.889
 man free i can connect here the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.340
 motto who can not connect who has 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.440
 something wrong then something here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.650
 even knowing is important to say 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160
 the files have 3 course per channel 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.789
 to step 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.300
 that means you can choose any of your maps 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.940
 distribute to a choir or all three 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.220
 distribute and thus we have a leak 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.729
 free pleasure that means we can 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.580
 with four gigabytes on all routs around the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.490
 500 players connect leave without 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.370
 Licks and kicks are more if you have more 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.470
 would like to connect players then it would be 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:05.130
 Recommended if you have the mysql server 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:08.500
 then on a second server purely does 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.690
 really enough four gigabytes and 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.960
 then you could help the cores even more 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:19.840
 for example, split into six pieces yes 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.080
 then the deepest one I made one 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.020
 on the one hand, there is an item behind 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.039
 one second disappears one 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.470
 security measure against pott bomba 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.270
 because, as you know, if you have quite a lot 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.349
 you can throw items on the floor 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:38.320
 Thus, a map break down and 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.090
 then also the server and us 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 see that your own disappears 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.030
 one 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.939
 customer it was also edited here 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.330
 switch time that is normal that is 0 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.330
 seconds 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.610
 I still have a few security holes 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.169
 stuffed on the one hand there was one 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.469
 Security gap can be found in the 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.509
 Seventh rich can sign up 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.090
 because actually the works wanted more 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:11.560
 as only three do the same and therefore 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.569
 there is also at first so as says 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.400
 Get Rich gaps run seventh that 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.529
 means one can at the 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.560
 Character selection with a book in the 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:24.759
 register rich that does not exist if 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.580
 then you can be worried about the 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:31.060
 homepage crash after that the whole server 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.729
 because of the mysql server or chor 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.710
 gets so many requests from something that 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.219
 it does not exist that it crashes 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.039
 comes this gap is fix then one more 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:45.039
 another gap and has the choir running 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:49.389
 stable despite many sweet errors despite 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:52.319
 many other errors it works 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.319
 Everything without problems 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:01.900
 The case is actually meant for one 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.550
 basic structure that is for if you are now 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.620
 a server wanted to make that her husband 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.150
 So even the basics have there on 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.150
 a current status 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.400
 That's why I have all the maps and pugs 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.349
 and all the stuff you do not need 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.039
 so that removes that means you find in 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:21.759
 the mob proto no pug technical de 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:24.729
 are or no mops halt 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.449
 nothing finds no scrap no items 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:30.520
 and so on everything de style and has with 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.949
 the two new features costume and 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.629
 energiesysteme 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:38.689
 I guess that it would have been as far as 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:40.669
 to my if have any questions 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.919
 if I should answer anything else 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.689
 then sometimes a new one can not 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.369
 tutorial still do in which then the 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:48.289
 questions to be answered 

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:51.189
 this is just a small one now 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:53.659
 I will be introduction later 

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:56.689
 upload another one today evening 

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:59.419
 which one then sees how to make a guitar point 

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:03.439
 gz file on a root server for 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:05.779
 get it that 's it so far from me 

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:09.649
 I hope you like the video 

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:11.799
 reasonably and until next 

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.799
 times
