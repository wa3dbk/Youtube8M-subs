00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
so the cutting plate the dive you'd put

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.930 
so the cutting plate the dive you'd put
your<00:01:04.570> card<00:01:05.140> stock<00:01:05.410> in<00:01:05.649> there<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:06.430> it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
your card stock in there and then it's

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.999 
your card stock in there and then it's
the<00:01:07.330> cutting<00:01:07.630> plate<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:07.990> top<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.649> run<00:01:08.890> it

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
the cutting plate on top and run it

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.010 
the cutting plate on top and run it
through<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.220> machine<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.300> um<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.930> other

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
through the machine so um the other

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.990 
through the machine so um the other
thing<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.380> like<00:01:11.560> about<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.430> takes<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.759> half

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
thing I like about it is it takes a half

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.660 
thing I like about it is it takes a half
a<00:01:13.149> sheet<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> eight<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.319> half<00:01:14.349> by<00:01:14.500> 11<00:01:15.099> so

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
a sheet of the eight and a half by 11 so

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.400 
a sheet of the eight and a half by 11 so
if<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:15.880> cut<00:01:16.149> your<00:01:16.360> sheet<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.899> eight<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.380> a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
if you cut your sheet to eight and a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.949 
if you cut your sheet to eight and a
half<00:01:17.440> by<00:01:17.590> five<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.220> half<00:01:18.539> this<00:01:19.539> is<00:01:19.750> what

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
half by five and a half this is what

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.050 
half by five and a half this is what
you'll<00:01:20.110> get<00:01:20.319> when<00:01:20.619> it<00:01:20.800> cuts<00:01:21.099> out<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.819> I'm<00:01:21.910> going

it okay so here's my piece I've already
ran<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.420> through<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.810> big<00:01:37.990> shot<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.560> actually

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
ran it through the big shot and actually

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460 
ran it through the big shot and actually
I<00:01:39.550> run<00:01:39.880> through<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.179> big<00:01:40.360> shot<00:01:40.390> twice<00:01:41.020> once

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
I run through the big shot twice once

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.550 
I run through the big shot twice once
with<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.009> dye<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.729> once<00:01:43.539> with<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:43.989> northern

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
with the dye and once with the northern

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.749 
with the dye and once with the northern
flurries<00:01:45.630> texture<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.750> boxing<00:01:47.110> folder<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:48.220> I

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
flurries texture and boxing folder so I

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.120 
flurries texture and boxing folder so I
just<00:01:49.330> position<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:50.800> and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
just position that so that this and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.249 
just position that so that this and
would<00:01:51.429> not<00:01:51.640> get<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.060> texture<00:01:52.420> because<00:01:52.929> see

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
would not get the texture because see

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.130 
would not get the texture because see
where<00:01:53.470> I've<00:01:53.619> put<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.009> sticky<00:01:54.280> strip<00:01:55.140> you're

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
where I've put the sticky strip you're

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.219 
where I've put the sticky strip you're
actually<00:01:56.380> using<00:01:56.649> five<00:01:57.429> pieces<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.539> that<00:01:58.810> one

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229

what<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.179> want<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.420> do<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.840> want<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.500> fold

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
what you want to do is you want to fold

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.270 
what you want to do is you want to fold
your<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.959> candy<00:02:11.319> wrapper<00:02:11.500> die<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.069> it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
your your candy wrapper die and it's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.910 
your your candy wrapper die and it's
going<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.520> fold<00:02:12.849> in<00:02:13.239> on<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.020> two<00:02:14.230> long<00:02:14.590> sides

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
going to fold in on the two long sides

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to fold in on the two long sides
and<00:02:15.660> actually<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.690> recommend

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and actually I recommend

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.979 
and actually I recommend
doing<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.000> folding<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:19.659> showing<00:02:19.870> you

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
doing the folding that I'm showing you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.259 
doing the folding that I'm showing you
right<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:20.469> the<00:02:20.799> two<00:02:21.040> long<00:02:21.340> sides<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.090> then

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
right now the two long sides and then

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.140 
right now the two long sides and then
the<00:02:22.480> four<00:02:23.250> kind<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.459> come<00:02:24.700> down<00:02:24.939> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the four kind of that come down the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.559 
the four kind of that come down the
middle<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.890> recommend<00:02:26.890> doing<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.159> before<00:02:27.569> if

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
middle I recommend doing that before if

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.270 
middle I recommend doing that before if
you<00:02:28.870> want<00:02:29.079> to<00:02:29.170> run<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.500> through<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.739> texture

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
you want to run it through the texture

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.789 
you want to run it through the texture
embossing<00:02:30.939> folder<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.780> way<00:02:31.930> you've<00:02:32.560> got

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
embossing folder and that way you've got

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.679 
embossing folder and that way you've got
some<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.159> those<00:02:33.250> score<00:02:33.609> lines<00:02:33.640> already<00:02:34.090> in

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
some of those score lines already in

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.619 
some of those score lines already in
there<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.040> see<00:02:36.310> them<00:02:36.519> when<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.299> pull

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
there and you can see them when you pull

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.140 
there and you can see them when you pull
this<00:02:37.840> out<00:02:38.079> of<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.319> texture<00:02:38.709> folder<00:02:38.920> okay<00:02:39.909> so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
this out of the texture folder okay so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.569 
this out of the texture folder okay so
now<00:02:40.629> we're<00:02:41.140> at<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.409> point<00:02:41.590> where<00:02:41.829> we're<00:02:42.430> going

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
now we're at the point where we're going

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.270 
now we're at the point where we're going
to<00:02:42.640> basically<00:02:43.150> assemble<00:02:43.780> our<00:02:44.019> our<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:45.069> box

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
to basically assemble our our little box

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.149 
to basically assemble our our little box
here<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.510> let<00:02:46.810> me<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.109> these<00:02:47.290> little<00:02:47.530> sticky

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
here so let me get these little sticky

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.729 
here so let me get these little sticky
strips<00:02:48.459> off<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.170> trouble<00:02:50.200> like

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
strips off and if you have trouble like

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.640 
strips off and if you have trouble like
I<00:02:50.950> do<00:02:51.010> sometimes<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.840> take<00:02:53.079> my<00:02:53.109> little

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
I do sometimes I just take my little

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.030 
I do sometimes I just take my little
paper<00:02:54.639> snips<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.269> use<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.169> ends<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.769> to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
paper snips and use the ends of them to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.309 
paper snips and use the ends of them to
kind<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> peel<00:02:57.669> that<00:02:58.000> off<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.750> fourth<00:03:02.019> one

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
kind of peel that off and the fourth one

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.440 
kind of peel that off and the fourth one
and<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.769> last<00:03:02.799> one<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:05.799> we<00:03:05.859> go<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
and the last one all right here we go so

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.289 
and the last one all right here we go so
now<00:03:07.810> what<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.919> do<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.310> fold<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.239> half

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
now what I like to do is fold it in half

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.890 
now what I like to do is fold it in half
and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.349> i<00:03:11.560> tuck<00:03:11.889> this<00:03:11.919> under<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
and then i tuck this under and just

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.940 
and then i tuck this under and just
adhere<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.409> so<00:03:15.340> there<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:15.669> go<00:03:16.019> now<00:03:17.019> I'm<00:03:17.769> going

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
adhere it so there we go now I'm going

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.020 
adhere it so there we go now I'm going
to<00:03:18.010> come<00:03:18.189> in<00:03:18.370> closer<00:03:18.700> for<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
to come in closer for you and can you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.899 
to come in closer for you and can you
see<00:03:22.359> all<00:03:22.389> these<00:03:22.780> diagonal<00:03:23.470> lines<00:03:23.739> well<00:03:24.639> what

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
see all these diagonal lines well what

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.210 
see all these diagonal lines well what
we're<00:03:25.060> going<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.239> do<00:03:25.419> is<00:03:25.780> give<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.799> quick

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
we're going to do is give you a quick

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.430 
we're going to do is give you a quick
easy<00:03:27.430> way<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.790> do<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.299> instead<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.900> trying<00:03:29.229> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
easy way to do this instead of trying to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800 
easy way to do this instead of trying to
fold<00:03:29.680> these<00:03:29.919> one<00:03:30.190> at<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.430> time<00:03:30.699> you're<00:03:31.419> going<00:03:31.659> to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
fold these one at a time you're going to

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.420 
fold these one at a time you're going to
fold<00:03:32.109> each<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:33.040> ends<00:03:33.489> into<00:03:34.139> themselves

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
fold each of the ends into themselves

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.399 
fold each of the ends into themselves
forming<00:03:36.430> kind<00:03:36.639> of<00:03:36.729> like<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:36.909> triangle<00:03:37.409> and

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
forming kind of like a triangle and

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.229 
forming kind of like a triangle and
you're<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.859> do<00:03:38.949> that<00:03:39.129> at<00:03:39.400> both<00:03:39.609> both

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
you're going to do that at both both

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.539 
you're going to do that at both both
ends<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:40.959> then<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.799> you're<00:03:41.919> going<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.220> do<00:03:42.340> is

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
ends and then what you're going to do is

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.849 
ends and then what you're going to do is
flip<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.120> over<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:45.690> do<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.720> again<00:03:47.139> so<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.620> kind

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
flip it over and do it again so you kind

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.149 
flip it over and do it again so you kind
of<00:03:47.919> want<00:03:48.659> folding<00:03:49.659> going<00:03:49.930> both<00:03:50.169> directions<00:03:50.500> on

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
of want folding going both directions on

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.250 
of want folding going both directions on
that<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:52.269> I'm<00:03:52.359> going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.870> other<00:03:53.019> end

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
that so I'm going to do the other end

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.550 
that so I'm going to do the other end
will<00:03:53.440> click<00:03:53.739> here<00:03:54.040> for<00:03:54.639> you<00:03:55.290> because<00:03:56.290> once

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
will click here for you because once

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.159 
will click here for you because once
we're<00:03:56.859> done<00:03:57.040> with<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.840> there's<00:03:58.840> still

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
we're done with this there's still

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.550 
we're done with this there's still
another<00:03:59.590> step<00:03:59.979> to<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.389> folding<00:04:01.389> there<00:04:02.260> we<00:04:02.379> go

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
another step to this folding there we go

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.369 
another step to this folding there we go
what<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> want<00:04:03.609> you<00:04:03.669> to<00:04:03.819> do<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.599> one<00:04:04.840> I'll<00:04:04.989> open

this and now what I want to do is just

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.340 
this and now what I want to do is just
grab<00:04:54.110> these<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.850> I'm<00:04:55.850> twisting<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.900> pushing

grab these and I'm twisting and pushing
down<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.950> opening<00:04:58.460> up<00:04:58.580> at<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.880> same<00:04:59.090> time

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
down and opening up at the same time

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.420 
down and opening up at the same time
sounds<00:05:00.230> like<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.380> lot<00:05:00.590> of<00:05:00.620> steps<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.190> at<00:05:01.310> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
sounds like a lot of steps to do at the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.160 
sounds like a lot of steps to do at the
same<00:05:01.610> time<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.120> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.390> naturally<00:05:02.930> works

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
same time but it kind of naturally works

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.390 
same time but it kind of naturally works
so<00:05:03.890> we're<00:05:04.010> open<00:05:04.490> twist<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.630> push<00:05:06.020> down<00:05:06.400> there

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
so we're open twist and push down there

so we're open twist and push down there
you<00:05:07.640> go<00:05:08.140> very<00:05:09.140> quick<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.710> easy<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:10.040> do<00:05:10.310> and
