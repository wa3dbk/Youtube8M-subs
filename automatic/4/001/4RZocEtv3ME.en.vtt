 <i>My name is Liesel Meminger.</i> 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.796
 <i>I don't have a family or a place I can call home.</i> 

00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:18.719
 <i>I have never understood the meaning of the word "hope."</i> 

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:23.147
 <i>But I'm going to get to know the people who change it all.</i> 

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.574
 Come on! Say hello to your new parents. 

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:29.116
 Your Majesty. 

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.512
 You'll call me "mom" from now on, okay? 

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:39.546
 And you will call that lazy piggy "papa". 

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.061
 Your first book. 

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.136
 - Are you sure it's yours? - She wasn't mine. 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.536
 Can you read at all? Come on! Read one word! 

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:55.954
 I'm not a good reader myself, you know? We'll help each other. 

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.354
 I have to tell you something important, Liesel. 

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:07.323
 - Who is it, papa? - His name is Max, he needs help. 

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:11.498
 I need you to promise me you won't tell anyone. 

00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:17.642
 - Is that your book? - She wasn't mine. 

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.045
 From the studio that brought "Pi and his life" 

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:23.698
 Mum! They come. They search the cellars. 

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.748
 When someone sees him, they take you away 

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.953
 and I can't tell you what they would do with him. 

00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:33.014
 <i>The words were her inspiration.</i> 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.195
 If your eyes could talk, what would they say? 

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:40.963
 <i>Courage will lead her.</i> 

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:43.841
 You're hiding someone, right? 

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:47.043
 - Can we trust her, is she a child? - He's our daughter. 

00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.789
 <i>Hope will be her life.</i> 

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:52.677
 I can't lose anyone else. 

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:55.498
 You kept me alive, never forget it. 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.784
 Are you stealing books? Why? 

00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:03.037
 When life robs you, you must sometimes rob it. 

00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:05.759
 According to a successful book, which was called "BRILLANT". 

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:09.005
 "Great success" 

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:11.175
 Words are life, Liesel. 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.127
 "EXTREMELY" 

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:16.042
 All those pages are for you to describe. 

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:21.894
