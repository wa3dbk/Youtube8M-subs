00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.970
 sign of the is calm he is serene he 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.360
 know who will win we have to wait 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.830
 still the shot of the cannon for 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.089
 to let go 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 what time for the massive company 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 also i think it's yes for for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.760
 all the whole team because like 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 we told you there is a team 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
 technique but there is also the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 communication and then to the sponsor and and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.250
 it is true that it is when we win a 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.689
 Vendée Globe I have lived there four 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.349
 years since you know land was 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 my sponsor 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 he had offered me to do the vendée 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.320
 globe 2008 I declined the offer 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.550
 and suddenly we chose jacky 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.649
 lorenzetti the landlord had 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 chose Michel desjoyeaux and blow 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.780
 I was still a little bit in the team 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.399
 Foncia and it's true that with 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 see this boat crossing the line 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.739
 arrival under our colors is when 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 even a very large great moment 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.960
 pride is there too I believe that the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.320
 president of foncia can say to himself eh ben 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.050
 I made the good choice massive which in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.670
 ended 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.310
 with always this swell and this boat 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.409
 who is 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.710
 which surf can read since the wind 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.659
 back and who approaches the line 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.909
 massive massive arrival participated 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.250
 at the thierry dubois project there is 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.799
 a few years he had taken a liking to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.630
 this adventure of an adventure of the vendée 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.580
 globe and that's right he was not the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.080
 main partner and the boat 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.030
 was called solidarity and like you 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.270
 saw it on the hull of the massif 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.659
 solidarity is an essential point 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.520
 at their home 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.520
 and suddenly he had taken a liking to this 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 race and they came back with the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 budget it's true but also with the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.690
 skipper it was necessary for this edition 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.209
 2012 2013 and it was not easy to 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560
 to bet on a 27 year old since the 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.640
 contract was signed a few 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.250
 years it was not obvious and there bah 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.170
 the choice was good bravo congratulations to them and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.360
 we know they will continue until 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.000
 at least in 2014 there will be the road 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.539
 during this year 2013 on the transat 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 Jacques Vabre 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.440
 what can françois do after 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.930
 I believe that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.120
 we can predict a very bright future 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.380
 because when you're 29 and you're 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.510
 just won the sold globe I believe 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.200
 that we really have everything we need from 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.630
 françois go see the buoy 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 and the line there that is going to be 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.230
 materialized we will see it 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 pierre-françois we'll let you 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.360
 orders for these last minutes in 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.050
 sea ​​with françois gabart for the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.050
 crossing the line 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.690
 ok we are waiting for pierre franois 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.890
 will live the arrival with of course 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.670
 the sound and the vhf we look on 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.950
 look at the massif of françois gabart le 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.840
 crossing the line with the computer 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.720
 alain gautier is looking at 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.239
 to calculate the time of courson ball goes 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.180
 arrive very quickly this time of 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.450
 race on françois gabart who in 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.980
 finishes victorious from the 7th edition 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.769
 of the sold globe 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.110
 at 29 barely the last 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.260
 maneuvers the last seconds at sea 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.500
 for françois gabart the issue la 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.480
 joy go go to the explosion for 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.549
 the moment very very calm and he looks 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.890
 the finish line it drinks it must be 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.209
 shake in the head in al-hassaba 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.680
 bubbling yes it's true that it 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.100
 seethes 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.380
 it's a mix of a lot of things 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.520
 I think he's going to realize that he 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.890
 did really a very very beautiful 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.340
 race in the east in the hours that 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.170
 are coming 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.270
 because here he was focused on his 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 race but then he will feel that he has 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.940
 spent something very strong 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 so we can imagine that it's going to be a 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.070
 moment it's going to be 78 days it's going to be 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.060
 two hours 18 minutes and a few 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.730
 few seconds I imagine 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.530
 yeah that's this hen in the world and we 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.840
 greet them massive supporters there 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 who are out by dozens who 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.010
 look on the giant screen at the arrival of the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.320
 massive boat look at the line 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.000
 the buoy of the nook 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.970
 she had a leader who will take us 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.250
 accounts and at then look look 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.250
 it's not good that the beautiful 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:30.319
 bah is not great 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.330
 françois gabart tried to raise his arms 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.899
 and raise your arms which makes us so 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:46.409
 you can let go tamani to françois two 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:46.409
 hours allowed Please 33 40 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.760

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.180

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.539
 small mistakes if we see the 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.039
 caci a habib balcony is certain a 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.080

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.610
 a little sad if there had not been a 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.970
