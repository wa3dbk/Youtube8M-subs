00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.759
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.230
 Say goodbye, let's get on the real appraisal from this time 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:22.580
 The game I'm playing this time started the closed beta test the other day 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.460
 It is a game world of go ships 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.140
 world of go ships known at world of tanks 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.439
 Belarusian game company 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:36.590
 It is an online game developed by 4 gaming. Net 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.360
 Actually operate the developed warship and planned Taka space from the Russo-Japanese War to per second battle 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.290
 Quarrel with the enemy and firing of guns 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.570
 Speaking It means that flat's so-called third-person shooter game 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.130
 Whirl 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.210
 I have that more or less correct Yeah Do not thing I Navy version of the 2 do camphor 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:56.220
 I'm What kind world of certain ships of super-dreadnought Yamatoya 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 Japanese ships such as the rapid destroyer Shimashe which recorded 40 knots in speed 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.590
 Bimonthly regular aircraft carrier Essex-class aircraft carrier or 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.520
 Fletcher class destroyer with a total of 175 seats 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:14.530
 Such as the arrival of US ships, etc. Other than that, appraisals such as Soviet Union Germany will appear 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:19.930
 Well, but also it is so for the time being tanks'm not Te game stuffy dreams and romance is jammed boy 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 It's just like a big iron block and something cool is decided. 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 Curl self-propelled mortar can 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 It is this game that has been a topic since the announcement 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 Alpha test started in July 2014 and closed beta test the other day 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:41.159
 At the same time as the start , the obligation agreement has been canceled the day when we have met so far 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 Videos and live broadcasts are possible. Even if you look at live broadcasts, it feels like someone is always broadcasting 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.220
 Shina 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.560
 Follow 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 It's a game with a high degree of attention 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.060
 Unexpectedly Let actually play mean that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:00.549
 The graphic is beautiful This time I dropped the graphic setting to the minimum because of the recording 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.190
 But still this quality 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:09.789
 Though it may be the goodness of the appraisal, it may be a depiction of scattered islands or distant clouds 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.750
 Quite majestic and good feeling 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.780
 Blue sky White clouds soaring islands Vast ocean 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.860
 Shelling warship passing over and one 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 Do Well is really peace peace 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:33.670
 I 'm sad but this is a war I guess I found an enemy cruiser 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.670
 Do not hit on anything or misguided direction if let's shelling 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:44.600
 The other party is moving as well as moving here in the first step 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:50.660
 It means I not shooting so-called deviation shooting predicted it is required 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.630
 Even if that cruiser we, including us, are in smashing a bag on this wreck 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.920
 The victory method of is also the steering technique and the shooting accuracy 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.730
 It's because it's about to beat a bag with a large number of appraisals than the enemy 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.960
 Only in the world of tanks LEMINGS hated in this game 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.580
 Rather welcome 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.580
 One seat isolated in the map such that there is no little thing to hide is a Gochin straight line 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.860
 That's why one of the enemy's cruisers was sunk by bombardment 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:25.470
 However, the destroyer's method is not so powerful 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.640
 So , if the successor of the treasure trooper Torpedo's torpedo is slow, but it only hits 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.810
 One shot 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.320
 Before cutting the physical strength of the enemy that can cut the enemy of physical fitness at once 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.100
 Rather it seems to be cutting off your strength , but it 's okay 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.100
 It survived of miracle and downside also hit hit or by any chance if you pray 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:52.710
 If you notice what I'm saying in the breath of the worm, the torpedo that I struck just before it reaches near the enemy 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.710
 Arivederci to return the interest to the previous damage 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.620
 processor 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:03.920
 Door Well Buchikamasu a torpedo effect force trims on the side of the enemy taking advantage of the speed in such a feeling 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:09.110
 Is the basic battle of the destroyer 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.530
 It's too long for the next 5 kilometer-long cruiser next time it's too far for the torpedo to hit 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.870
 so 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:19.970
 At first he hit the deck and hit fire if he is lucky enough to fight 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.780
 What story of If you can hit the merchant deck that can destroy the methods and animals 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.500
 But 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.000
 I 'm just going to the side from the beginning 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.540
 Now that the enemy is approaching within 3 km , it's finally time for torpedoes 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.860
 If it is this distance, it will not be in time to answer the cue 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:40.699
 By now, the enemy should be jumping into the four torpedoes that suddenly appeared in front of her eyes 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.840
 At the same time , let's make a hit and get some damage 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.840
 Come on, get a torpedo 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:55.290
 Aare That's departure was felt that went our superb pass through between the torpedo 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.830
 Oh, it's the flow that the enemy's shooting target is reflected to me, it 's really close to it when shot at this close range 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.320
 Nor 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.740
 One more torpedo and another one to hit 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.740
 Nainda is 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 Dangerous Dangerous Torpedoes Are Approaching You I'll Never Avoid You 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.040
 I thought I would die 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.590
 Next, another ferocious destroyer rushed in in a short time, so I collaborated with the devilhouse of the view 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.300
 Let's intercept at 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.230
 This area is surrounded by Toshima, the end of the map, so I have to move while watching for collisions 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.420
 No good 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.169
 Since I see the torpedo of the enemy is 10 a few seconds the enemy will not come shot a torpedo 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.310
 There is no problem in bold entry 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:42.180
 I 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.180
 Or rather the enemy would collide with the island 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:53.030
 Oh, the enemy really stopped colliding with the island 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.030
 This is Chaimashou asked to become part of the remains island selling and crispy the good fortune torpedo 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:02.690
 It seems that the bombardment of the enemy is concentrated on the near side destroyer, and this is likely to be defeated. 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.690
 Good or bad 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:17.620
 In the Japanese name and inundation is also generated two times in the past, further confirmed the secondary damage of continuous damage 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:23.470
 And enemy sounds in the next perfect wreck Gochin and burst into flames is okay I you is likely to hit the island 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.980
 If you do a big monster theft from here right I will not hit the last minute island Change policy from here just before 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.340
 To the interception of the destroyer that I saw 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.660
 I wonder 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.840
 It stopped colliding on the ruins of the destroyer you sunk earlier 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.850
 Take that into consideration 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:44.120
 I There are short-term in-depth can be the cruiser Tsu same towards the husband behind Yara what 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:49.699
 Moreover, it seems that it is concentrated on the other party cruiser from the direction of the bombardment 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.510
 Change the direction and secure the side of the enemy cruiser by thrusting backwards as it is 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:57.430
 I hit the torpedo from a very close distance 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:07:02.950
 If it sees from the enemy cruiser, the enemy destroyer will squeeze while backing up 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:07.800
 What This Now Saa Tomo enters a little to fire the city of a little more in the torpedo after 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.800
 No matter how hard you try, you should die if it is this position 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.940
 Hey Egetsu 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:26.270
 There is no enemy cruiser around from the next battlefield to the other island and the island today. 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:30.150
 With this strength you can only survive the last blow if it does not seem to survive 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:35.000
 Attract the enemy until the last minute and try to strike a torpedo 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.000
 Come and go departure Come After that I just pray that hit 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:46.879
 with over 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:52.320
 It's a wonderful co- fall. 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:56.000
 You wish Regards If you encounter on the battlefield in it up to here this time I 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000
 Thank you for your viewing
