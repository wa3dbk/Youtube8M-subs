recording<00:00:08.580> software<00:00:08.820> but<00:00:09.240> anyway<00:00:09.540> take<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
recording software but anyway take a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.689 
recording software but anyway take a
look<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.170> play<00:00:10.440> man<00:00:10.710> real<00:00:11.460> quick<00:00:16.699> alright

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
look at this play man real quick alright

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.340 
look at this play man real quick alright
let's<00:00:17.910> take<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> look<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.510> slow<00:00:18.779> motion<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
let's take a look at a slow motion and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
let's take a look at a slow motion and
this<00:00:19.740> will<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> quick<00:00:20.130> video<00:00:20.520> man<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this will be a quick video man this is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.720 
this will be a quick video man this is
just<00:00:21.539> again<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.260> showcase<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.070> reason<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
just again to showcase the reason as to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.920 
just again to showcase the reason as to
why<00:00:24.769> EA<00:00:25.769> needs<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> some<00:00:27.599> type<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
why EA needs to go to some type of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.980 
why EA needs to go to some type of
physics<00:00:28.730> now<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:29.939> saying<00:00:30.150> real-time

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
physics now I'm not saying real-time

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.229 
physics now I'm not saying real-time
physics<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:32.399> saying<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.059> has<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
physics I'm saying it just has to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.560 
physics I'm saying it just has to
respect<00:00:33.840> physics<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.790> maybe<00:00:36.030> even<00:00:36.360> its

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
respect physics you know maybe even its

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
respect physics you know maybe even its
collision<00:00:36.840> based<00:00:37.200> system<00:00:37.649> maybe<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.309> can

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
collision based system maybe you can

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
collision based system maybe you can
make<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.059> dynamic<00:00:39.829> because<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
make it more dynamic because this is a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
make it more dynamic because this is a
type<00:00:41.430> gameplay<00:00:41.910> you'll<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.329> take<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> look<00:00:43.500> at

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
type gameplay you'll get take a look at

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.209 
type gameplay you'll get take a look at
this<00:00:48.350> alright<00:00:49.350> let's<00:00:49.649> flip<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> around<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
this alright let's flip it around the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
this alright let's flip it around the
other<00:00:50.309> side<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.059> running<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.449> forte

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
other side and I was running with forte

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
other side and I was running with forte
and<00:00:52.219> I'll<00:00:53.219> let<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.789> guys<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.390> I'm

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of course the normal flaws in the game

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
of course the normal flaws in the game

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this video is about man again the floor

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
this video is about man again the floor
videos<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.470> coming<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.189> showing

videos will be coming i will be showing

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
videos will be coming i will be showing
those<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
those as well but take a look at this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.969 
those as well but take a look at this
this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> show<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> why<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> have

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this is just a show this is why you have

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.999 
this is just a show this is why you have
to<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:26.970> type<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.210> dynamic<00:01:27.600> engine<00:01:28.290> look

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to have some type of dynamic engine look

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.149 
to have some type of dynamic engine look
at<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.250> happens<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.829> alright<00:01:31.829> let's<00:01:31.979> back

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
at what happens here alright let's back

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
at what happens here alright let's back
it<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it up one more time and look at what

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.200 
it up one more time and look at what
forte<00:01:37.350> does<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.890> puts<00:01:38.159> his<00:01:38.310> hand<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.820> alignment

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
forte does he puts his hand on alignment

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
forte does he puts his hand on alignment
now<00:01:39.990> EA<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> something<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.369> don't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
now EA this is something that we don't

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.569 
now EA this is something that we don't
see<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> time<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.899> game<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:44.280> needs

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
see all the time in this game this needs

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.109 
see all the time in this game this needs
to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.180> dynamic<00:01:46.430> his<00:01:47.430> hand<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to be more dynamic his hand on the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
to be more dynamic his hand on the
lawmen<00:01:48.780> tries<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
lawmen tries to get a little bit of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
lawmen tries to get a little bit of
leverage<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.820> guess<00:01:51.270> he<00:01:51.450> could<00:01:51.630> fill<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.619> he

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
leverage I guess he could fill or he

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
leverage I guess he could fill or he
could<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.159> clay<00:01:53.399> matthews<00:01:53.880> coming<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.960> he

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
could see clay matthews coming so he

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.740 
could see clay matthews coming so he
tries<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.890> left<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.880> he<00:01:57.509> tries

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
tries to go back to the left as he tries

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.130 
tries to go back to the left as he tries
to<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> he<00:01:58.409> gets<00:01:58.619> caught<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.130> air

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
little further also you can tell you it

moved<00:02:06.689> his<00:02:06.930> linemen<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.950> physics<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
moved his linemen as well so physics is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.850 
moved his linemen as well so physics is
being<00:02:08.729> detected<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.750> point<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.470> then

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
being detected at some point and then

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.800 
being detected at some point and then
honk<00:02:11.129> comes<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.970> lays<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> big<00:02:13.050> hit

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
honk comes in and lays the big hit

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.510 
honk comes in and lays the big hit
and<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.920> get<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.130> fumble<00:02:17.010> all<00:02:18.010> right<00:02:18.220> folks

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and you get a fumble all right folks

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.309 
and you get a fumble all right folks
this<00:02:18.670> was<00:02:18.819> just<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.060> quick<00:02:19.270> video<00:02:19.450> again<00:02:20.080> this

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
this was just a quick video again this

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.860 
this was just a quick video again this
is<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.770> showcase<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.910> reason<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.510> why

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
is just a showcase the reason as to why

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.720 
is just a showcase the reason as to why
EA<00:02:23.110> has<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:24.540> lean<00:02:25.540> towards<00:02:26.319> physics<00:02:26.830> respected

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
EA has to lean towards physics respected

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.229 
EA has to lean towards physics respected
engine<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:29.040> physics<00:02:30.040> respected<00:02:30.730> engine<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
engine a physics respected engine and

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.540 
engine a physics respected engine and
again<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.140> take<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.769> however<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.340> want

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
again you can take that however you want

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.949 
again you can take that however you want
to<00:02:33.580> take<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.940> I'm<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.269> saying<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.690> need<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.840> be

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
to take it I'm not saying it need to be

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.229 
to take it I'm not saying it need to be
real-time<00:02:35.380> physics<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.459> doesn't<00:02:36.940> have<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.120> be

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
real-time physics it doesn't have to be

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.540 
real-time physics it doesn't have to be
you<00:02:37.510> for<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.680> has<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.890> respect

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
you for you it just has to respect

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.970 
you for you it just has to respect
physics<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.239> like<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.140> said<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.530> collision

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
physics and like I said the collision

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
physics and like I said the collision
based<00:02:42.160> system<00:02:42.580> could<00:02:42.910> be<00:02:43.060> danced<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.660> maybe

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
based system could be danced and maybe

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.650 
based system could be danced and maybe
that's<00:02:44.050> all<00:02:44.230> you're<00:02:44.980> capable<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.489> doing<00:02:45.910> but

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that's all you're capable of doing but

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.920 
that's all you're capable of doing but
with<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.440> system<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:49.000> can<00:02:49.180> beef<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.569> up<00:02:49.690> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
with that system you can beef it up and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.970 
with that system you can beef it up and
make<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:50.950> more<00:02:51.549> dynamic<00:02:52.440> once<00:02:53.440> again<00:02:53.769> let's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
make it more dynamic once again let's

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.289 
make it more dynamic once again let's
take<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> look<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.549> regular<00:02:54.819> speed<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:01.060> right

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
take a look in regular speed all right

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.190 
take a look in regular speed all right
folks<00:03:01.620> let<00:03:02.620> me<00:03:02.709> know<00:03:02.830> what<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> think
