one<00:00:11.700> game<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.389> me<00:00:12.750> which<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.019> crazy<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
one game just like me which is crazy I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
one game just like me which is crazy I
figured<00:00:14.490> I'd<00:00:14.759> be<00:00:14.940> facing<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.360> against<00:00:15.599> people

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
figured I'd be facing up against people

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.029 
figured I'd be facing up against people
that<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.020> played<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.410> bit<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.010> I

that have played a little bit more but I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.500 
that have played a little bit more but I
mean<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.430> guess<00:00:17.730> that's<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> seeds<00:00:18.390> are

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
mean I guess that's what the seeds are

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
mean I guess that's what the seeds are
for<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.900> anyway<00:00:19.199> he<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.740> creating<00:00:20.070> Hodges<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.640> got
