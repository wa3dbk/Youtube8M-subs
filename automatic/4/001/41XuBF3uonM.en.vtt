00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to see early aggression yet coming from

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690 
to see early aggression yet coming from
TLO<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.560> he<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.979> bringing<00:02:02.310> down<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
TLO as he is now bringing down that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
TLO as he is now bringing down that
smiling<00:02:03.119> pool<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:04.049> seeing<00:02:04.409> him<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.829> for

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
smiling pool not seeing him going for

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
smiling pool not seeing him going for
gas<00:02:05.280> yet<00:02:05.670> either<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.149> course<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.420> doesn't<00:02:06.540> know

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
gas yet either of course it doesn't know

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.109 
gas yet either of course it doesn't know
the<00:02:06.750> resources<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.250> maybe<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.550> soon<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:08.940> see

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the resources so maybe as soon as we see

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
the resources so maybe as soon as we see
JP<00:02:09.390> does<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> resources<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.860> we're<00:02:10.950> not

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
JP does have the resources but we're not

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.520 
JP does have the resources but we're not
seeing<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.730> gas

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
seeing go for that gas

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.620 
seeing go for that gas
so<00:02:13.530> he<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.910> early<00:02:15.240> expand

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so he is going for that early expand

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.800 
so he is going for that early expand
going<00:02:15.870> fat<00:02:16.080> early<00:02:16.440> money<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.420> looks<00:02:18.420> like

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
going fat early money and looks like

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.930 
going fat early money and looks like
torches<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.950> pretty<00:02:20.130> basic<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:20.790> he's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
torches going pretty basic here but he's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.400 
torches going pretty basic here but he's
going<00:02:21.120> about<00:02:21.210> second<00:02:21.690> refineries<00:02:22.230> who's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.120 
going about second refineries who's
going<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.770> gas<00:02:23.040> early<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.770> do<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.070> him

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
going for gas early on and we do see him

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.590 
going for gas early on and we do see him
pumping<00:02:26.490> out<00:02:26.610> submarine<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.420> kind<00:02:27.570> of

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
pumping out submarine just kind of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.720 
pumping out submarine just kind of
chilling<00:02:28.200> back<00:02:28.470> bring<00:02:28.800> him<00:02:28.890> back<00:02:29.100> seeing<00:02:29.700> that

chilling back bring him back seeing that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.060 
chilling back bring him back seeing that
drone<00:02:30.570> from<00:02:30.810> TLO<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.620> start<00:02:31.830> attacking

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
drone from TLO going to start attacking

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.400 
drone from TLO going to start attacking
that<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.970> factory<00:02:33.450> coming<00:02:33.780> down<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.290> we

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that and a factory coming down so we

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.410 
that and a factory coming down so we
might<00:02:34.560> see<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.190> build<00:02:35.460> from<00:02:36.030> torch<00:02:36.270> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
might see the same build from torch that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
might see the same build from torch that
we<00:02:36.480> saw<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.660> game<00:02:36.930> number<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.680> 111

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
we saw in game number one with that 111

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.390 
we saw in game number one with that 111
build<00:02:38.520> early<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.010> going

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
build early on and you know just going

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.430 
build early on and you know just going
from<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.000> we'll<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.390> how<00:02:42.420> torch<00:02:42.990> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
from there so we'll see how torch the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930 
from there so we'll see how torch the
sides<00:02:43.650> go<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:44.160> you'll<00:02:44.340> decide<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.760> change

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
sides go or if you'll decide to change

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.080 
sides go or if you'll decide to change
up<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.270> boat<00:02:45.510> from<00:02:45.660> last<00:02:45.900> time<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.820> course

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
up this boat from last time of course

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
up this boat from last time of course
now<00:02:48.300> with<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.810> extractor<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:49.860> we're<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
now with the extractor so we're going to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.250 
now with the extractor so we're going to
start<00:02:50.160> seeing<00:02:50.490> some<00:02:50.670> gas<00:02:50.880> come<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.600> at

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
start seeing some gas come out and at

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
start seeing some gas come out and at
not<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.740> for<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:52.940> metabolic<00:02:53.940> boost<00:02:54.240> of

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
not going for that metabolic boost of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.070 
not going for that metabolic boost of
course<00:02:54.570> because<00:02:54.750> he's<00:02:54.780> only<00:02:55.020> got<00:02:55.260> eight<00:02:55.820> 8<00:02:57.080> 16

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
