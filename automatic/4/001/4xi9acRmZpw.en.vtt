00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.099 
I said that arrow crab I had i'm not
sure<00:03:58.019> why<00:03:58.349> he<00:03:58.769> died<00:03:59.150> but<00:04:00.150> he<00:04:00.269> was<00:04:00.420> gone<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.959> I

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
sure why he died but he was gone and I

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.899 
sure why he died but he was gone and I
thought<00:04:01.379> if<00:04:01.530> anything<00:04:01.950> he<00:04:02.159> might<00:04:02.189> kill<00:04:02.609> one<00:04:02.879> of

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
thought if anything he might kill one of

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.089 
thought if anything he might kill one of
my<00:04:03.090> shrimp<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.170> coral<00:04:04.469> bandit<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.010> I

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
my shrimp I have the coral bandit and I

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.550 
my shrimp I have the coral bandit and I
have<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.459> red<00:04:05.700> fire<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.299> thought<00:04:07.079> he<00:04:07.379> if

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
have the red fire I thought he if

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
have the red fire I thought he if
anything<00:04:08.010> might<00:04:08.250> hurt<00:04:08.549> one<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.790> my<00:04:08.879> shrimp<00:04:09.269> but

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
anything might hurt one of my shrimp but

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.349 
anything might hurt one of my shrimp but
um<00:04:10.469> I<00:04:10.739> didn't<00:04:11.040> see<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.400> happened<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.939> him<00:04:12.150> but

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
um I didn't see what happened to him but

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.629 
um I didn't see what happened to him but
he<00:04:12.540> died<00:04:12.780> for<00:04:13.049> some<00:04:13.260> reason<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.280> wouldn't

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
he died for some reason so I wouldn't

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.060 
he died for some reason so I wouldn't
mix<00:04:14.700> him<00:04:15.150> with<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.599> red<00:04:15.959> fire<00:04:16.229> or<00:04:16.560> coral

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
mix him with the red fire or coral

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.420 
mix him with the red fire or coral
bandit<00:04:18.079> one<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.229> them<00:04:19.320> probably<00:04:19.799> killed<00:04:20.310> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
bandit one of them probably killed the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.060 
bandit one of them probably killed the
other<00:04:20.579> because<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:20.940> checked<00:04:21.209> all<00:04:21.389> my<00:04:22.070> water

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
other because I checked all my water

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.249 
other because I checked all my water
conditions<00:04:23.820> all<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.180> time<00:04:24.419> kept<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.050> really

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
conditions all the time kept it really

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.790 
conditions all the time kept it really
nice<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.800> even<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.520> safe<00:04:26.849> so<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:28.139> think<00:04:28.349> he<00:04:28.680> was

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
nice and even and safe so I think he was

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.520 
nice and even and safe so I think he was
killed<00:04:29.070> by<00:04:29.250> somebody<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.870> I'm<00:04:30.960> guessing<00:04:31.169> one

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
killed by somebody so I'm guessing one

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.990 
killed by somebody so I'm guessing one
of<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.710> shrimp<00:04:32.009> which<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.400> like<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.669> said<00:04:32.880> his

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
of the shrimp which is like I said his

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.400 
of the shrimp which is like I said his
odd<00:04:33.150> because<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.509> thought<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.840> anything<00:04:34.199> he

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
odd because I thought if anything he

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.800 
odd because I thought if anything he
might<00:04:34.440> kill<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:35.009> of<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.220> shrimp<00:04:38.539> so<00:04:39.539> here's

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
might kill one of the shrimp so here's

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.999 
might kill one of the shrimp so here's
my<00:04:39.870> tank<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.320> her<00:04:40.410> feeding<00:04:40.710> time<00:04:40.860> I'm<00:04:40.949> just

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
my tank to her feeding time I'm just

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.290 
my tank to her feeding time I'm just
gonna<00:04:41.190> let<00:04:41.400> go<00:04:41.550> ahead<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:41.910> let<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.060> keep

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
gonna let go ahead and let it keep

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.939 
gonna let go ahead and let it keep
showing<00:04:42.720> here<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.960> think<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.380> got<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> pretty<00:04:43.650> good

engineer goby and up top of course those

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.749 
engineer goby and up top of course those
are<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.389> polyps<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.169> corals<00:05:10.460> we<00:05:11.460> have<00:05:11.550> lots

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
are the polyps the corals we have lots

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.930 
are the polyps the corals we have lots
of<00:05:11.970> snails<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.570> here<00:05:12.810> we<00:05:12.960> have<00:05:13.080> some<00:05:13.940> turbo

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
of snails in here we have some turbo

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.310 
of snails in here we have some turbo
snails<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.570> think<00:05:15.750> they're<00:05:15.870> called<00:05:16.020> Mexican

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
snails I think they're called Mexican

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.499 
snails I think they're called Mexican
turbo<00:05:16.860> snails<00:05:16.919> we<00:05:17.400> have<00:05:17.520> hermit<00:05:17.909> crabs<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
turbo snails we have hermit crabs I

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.450 
turbo snails we have hermit crabs I
don't<00:05:18.990> know<00:05:19.050> if<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.169> could<00:05:19.259> see<00:05:19.320> them<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.310> get

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
don't know if you could see them and get

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.400 
don't know if you could see them and get
a<00:05:20.520> little<00:05:20.820> view<00:05:21.120> on<00:05:21.270> this<00:05:21.419> hermit<00:05:21.810> crab

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.050 

so<00:05:27.410> we<00:05:27.470> got<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.800> hermit<00:05:28.220> crab<00:05:28.430> we<00:05:28.550> got<00:05:28.699> like<00:05:28.880> a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
so we got that hermit crab we got like a

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.990 
so we got that hermit crab we got like a
lot<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.509> them<00:05:29.630> in<00:05:29.690> there<00:05:29.960> probably<00:05:30.350> I

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
lot of them in there probably I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.740 
lot of them in there probably I
accidently<00:05:32.000> stopped<00:05:32.240> my<00:05:32.389> video<00:05:32.600> we've

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
accidently stopped my video we've

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.270 
accidently stopped my video we've
probably<00:05:32.930> got<00:05:33.080> about<00:05:33.229> 10<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.680> those<00:05:33.889> hermit

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
probably got about 10 of those hermit

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.730 
probably got about 10 of those hermit
crabs<00:05:34.550> in<00:05:34.759> there<00:05:35.169> OOP<00:05:36.169> wanted<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.220> zoom<00:05:37.400> out
