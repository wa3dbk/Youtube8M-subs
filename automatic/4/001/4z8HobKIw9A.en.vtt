Adrenaline's<00:01:43.350> pumping<00:01:43.770> through<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
Adrenaline's pumping through you as it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
Adrenaline's pumping through you as it
actually<00:01:45.060> happens<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.530> actually

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
actually happens but I could actually

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.969

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
around and I saw James obviously

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.070 
around and I saw James obviously
unconscious<00:02:28.390> what<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.600> thought<00:02:28.810> he<00:02:28.930> was<00:02:29.020> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
unconscious what I thought he was a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.240 
unconscious what I thought he was a
little<00:02:29.200> bit<00:02:29.380> worse<00:02:29.560> because<00:02:29.770> just<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> way

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
little bit worse because just the way

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.660 
little bit worse because just the way
his<00:02:30.370> body<00:02:30.400> was<00:02:30.790> folded<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.860> obviously<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
his body was folded up so obviously you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.760 
his body was folded up so obviously you
know<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.990> sort<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.260> thought<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.560> better

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
know just sort of thought a better

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.980 
know just sort of thought a better
chaser<00:02:36.700> horse<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.420> didn't<00:02:37.720> think<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.930> would

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
chaser horse but I didn't think I would

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.460 
chaser horse but I didn't think I would
actually<00:02:38.340> catch<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.090> text<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.690> ran

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
actually catch up but a text that ran

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
actually catch up but a text that ran
towards<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.100> concrete<00:02:42.490> Jane<00:02:42.700> eternally

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
towards the concrete Jane eternally

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
towards the concrete Jane eternally
veered<00:02:43.810> left<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.410> then<00:02:44.740> ran<00:02:45.010> back<00:02:45.040> towards<00:02:45.790> me

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
veered left and then ran back towards me

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.470 
veered left and then ran back towards me
when<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.620> able<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:48.130> keep<00:02:48.940> back<00:02:49.120> onto<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
when I was able to keep back onto the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
when I was able to keep back onto the
grass<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.080> sort<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.350> ran<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.860> me<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.130> well

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
grass so it sort of ran into me as well

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.620 
grass so it sort of ran into me as well
because<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.640> was<00:02:51.730> getting<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.970> bit<00:02:52.090> tired<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.510> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
we didn't see there is because obviously

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.800 
we didn't see there is because obviously
the<00:03:15.580> camera<00:03:15.940> goes<00:03:16.090> back<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> finish<00:03:16.750> of

the<00:03:16.930> race<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.709> had<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.130> grab<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.400> horse<00:03:18.820> to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the race you had to grab the horse to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.570 
the race you had to grab the horse to
stop<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.330> yeah<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.510> finally<00:03:19.870> ran<00:03:20.019> up<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
stop it yeah I finally ran up and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.160 
stop it yeah I finally ran up and
actually<00:03:21.580> grabbed<00:03:22.180> hold<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.480> rain<00:03:22.690> just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
actually grabbed hold of the rain just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.020 
actually grabbed hold of the rain just
by<00:03:23.380> its<00:03:23.530> head<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.489> was<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> bit<00:03:24.850> hard

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
by its head but it was a bit hard

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.759 
by its head but it was a bit hard
because<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.600> cart<00:03:25.810> was<00:03:25.959> flipped<00:03:26.260> over<00:03:26.440> and

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
because the cart was flipped over and

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.289 
because the cart was flipped over and
the<00:03:26.890> shaft<00:03:27.160> was<00:03:27.430> sticking<00:03:27.730> out<00:03:27.970> probably

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
the shaft was sticking out probably

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.850 
the shaft was sticking out probably
about<00:03:28.360> half<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.840> metre<00:03:29.019> in<00:03:29.200> their<00:03:29.320> way<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.739> was

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
trying to avoid the shaft the end of the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.830

again<00:05:19.229> obviously<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.260> think<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.770> lot<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.130> people

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
again obviously I think a lot of people

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.830 
again obviously I think a lot of people
in<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.460> same<00:05:21.669> sort<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.000> situation<00:05:22.240> would

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
in the same sort of situation would

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.529 
in the same sort of situation would
obviously<00:05:23.110> do<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.530> same<00:05:23.740> thing<00:05:24.039> but<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.639> think

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
obviously do the same thing but I think

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.719 
obviously do the same thing but I think
is<00:05:25.720> your<00:05:26.199> Adrenaline's<00:05:26.710> pumping<00:05:27.190> at<00:05:27.490> that

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
is your Adrenaline's pumping at that

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.610 
is your Adrenaline's pumping at that
time<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.810> know<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:28.960> first<00:05:29.260> thing<00:05:29.470> I

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
time and you know the first thing I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.830 
time and you know the first thing I
thought<00:05:29.800> about<00:05:29.950> was<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.400> help<00:05:30.580> James<00:05:30.849> so<00:05:31.150> you

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
thought about was to help James so you

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.409 
thought about was to help James so you
know<00:05:32.190> he<00:05:33.190> obviously<00:05:33.490> didn't<00:05:33.970> come<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.240> too

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419
