00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.890
 to demonstrate the experience we use 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.840
 lens model which lens 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.770
 can be changed using lenses 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.770
 different release 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.570
 in this case we direct to the lens 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.480
 two beams 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.600
 parallel and superior optical network of the eye 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.930
 they're going to the point lying on 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 retina this model of normal eyes 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.220
 use lens as lens 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.740
 focal length which is more than 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.260
 previous case 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.150
 lens surface has a smaller 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.329
 curvature 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.859
 we will direct two beams in parallel the main thing 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.859
 optical mow eyes 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.579
 as we see splashing 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.780
 the lens they intersect at 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.870
 lying to the right of the retina 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 this model is hyperopia eyes 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.550
 now as a lens 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.660
 use a lens with a small focal 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.190
 distance i.e. surface curvature 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 lens more than in previous cases 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.010
 send two parallel beams 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.740
 as we see they intersect at a point 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.150
 located inside the eyeball 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 this model has myopic eyes 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 to correct such a defect 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 myopia is necessary 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700
 use a lens diffusing 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 glasses 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.009
 Russia is higher than the lenses placed in front 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.569
 eyes 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.200
 causes divergence of the rays falling on 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 lens and now leaning 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.719
 the lens they intersect at 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.949
 just on the retina 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.079
 that is, the effect was closed to the bone 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.790
 fixed
