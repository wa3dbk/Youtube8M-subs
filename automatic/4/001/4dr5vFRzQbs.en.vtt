00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this is a young Cabernet vine and we not

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
this is a young Cabernet vine and we not
really<00:01:03.629> care<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> point<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.489> it's

really care if it at this point if it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.630 
really care if it at this point if it's
got<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.530> single<00:01:07.530> trunk<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> multi

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
got a lot of single trunk or a multi
trunk<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.350> it'll<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.530> pruned<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
trunk because it'll get pruned down to

pull it through the plastic carton
keeping<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> roots<00:01:42.899> intact<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> see

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
keeping the roots intact and you can see

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
keeping the roots intact and you can see
this<00:01:45.360> media<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> rice<00:01:46.920> holes

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this media it's got a lot of rice holes

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.240 
this media it's got a lot of rice holes
and<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.790> lot<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.270> things<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> here

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
and a lot of other things in here

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920 
and a lot of other things in here
assuring<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:51.030> root

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
assuring that we have good root

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.030 
assuring that we have good root
structure<00:01:52.649> here's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> young<00:01:53.549> root<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.299> here

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
structure here's a young root right here

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.760

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.990 

then<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.470> go<00:02:17.709> ahead<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.130> tamp<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.670> a

then we just go ahead and tamp in a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080 
then we just go ahead and tamp in a
little<00:02:19.750> bit<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> foot<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:21.459> we<00:02:21.700> want<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
little bit with the foot as we want to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.960 
little bit with the foot as we want to
make<00:02:22.750> sure<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.140> there's<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.500> good<00:02:24.010> contact

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
make sure that there's a good contact

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.350 
make sure that there's a good contact
between<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.569> potted<00:02:26.100> media<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.760> soil

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
between that potted media and the soil

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.010 
between that potted media and the soil
that<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.990> been<00:02:29.290> planted<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:31.360> after<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
that it's been planted in then after the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.479 
that it's been planted in then after the
crew<00:02:32.230> goes<00:02:32.410> through<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.800> puts<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> vines

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
crew goes through and puts all the vines

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.240 
crew goes through and puts all the vines
in<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.760> ground<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.900> come<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.530> place<00:02:36.220> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
in the ground then they come and place a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.210 
in the ground then they come and place a
milk<00:02:36.550> carton<00:02:36.870> around<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.020> vine<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.680> put<00:02:39.100> this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
milk carton around the vine and put this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.190 
milk carton around the vine and put this
spaghetti<00:02:39.580> tube<00:02:40.000> inside<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.540> milk<00:02:40.780> carton

spaghetti tube inside that milk carton

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.840 
spaghetti tube inside that milk carton
so<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> make<00:02:41.650> sure<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> gets<00:02:42.069> water<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.790> a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
so it make sure it gets water on a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.290 
so it make sure it gets water on a
frequent<00:02:43.660> basis<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.470> ensure<00:02:44.860> good<00:02:45.300> rooting

milk<00:02:47.050> carton<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.410> good<00:02:47.650> because<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.400> helps

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
milk carton is good because it helps

vines out of these pots and we have seen

vines out of these pots and we have seen
in<00:03:34.930> systems<00:03:35.380> where<00:03:35.709> vineyards<00:03:36.310> might<00:03:36.489> get

bottom if you don't remove this vine out
of<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:46.750> pot<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.440> plant<00:03:47.709> this

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
of this pot and you just plant this

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.620 
of this pot and you just plant this
whole<00:03:48.040> pot<00:03:48.340> yes<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.940> roots<00:03:49.180> will<00:03:49.359> come

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
whole pot yes the roots will come

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.000 
whole pot yes the roots will come
through<00:03:49.989> but<00:03:50.859> again<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.459> whole<00:03:52.739> plastic<00:03:53.739> pot

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
through but again this whole plastic pot

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.460 
through but again this whole plastic pot
acts<00:03:54.340> like<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.640> big<00:03:54.940> girdle<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.660> will<00:03:56.200> actually

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
acts like a big girdle and will actually

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.310 
acts like a big girdle and will actually
kill<00:03:56.980> off<00:03:57.250> or<00:03:57.489> limit<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.120> growth<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.079> vine

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
kill off or limit the growth of the vine

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.319 
kill off or limit the growth of the vine
from<00:03:59.709> really<00:04:00.220> growing<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.820> be<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> strong

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
from really growing to be a strong

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.500 
from really growing to be a strong
healthy<00:04:01.840> vine<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.700> very<00:04:03.970> important

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
healthy vine so it is very important

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.539 
healthy vine so it is very important
that<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.870> two<00:04:05.019> things<00:04:05.320> remove<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.980> plastic

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
that for two things remove the plastic

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.289 
that for two things remove the plastic
container<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.480> vines<00:04:07.720> are<00:04:07.930> grown<00:04:08.140> in<00:04:08.470> and

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
container the vines are grown in and

the history of these wines one of the
reasons<00:04:32.979> we<00:04:33.219> talked<00:04:33.490> about<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:33.999> planting<00:04:34.539> new

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
reasons we talked about in planting new

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.600 
reasons we talked about in planting new
vines<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.289> trying<00:04:35.499> to<00:04:35.590> plant<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.039> trunks<00:04:36.490> as

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
rod many terms different again the fact

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.119 
rod many terms different again the fact
we<00:04:45.490> want<00:04:45.699> that<00:04:45.879> vine<00:04:46.659> to<00:04:47.020> grow<00:04:47.229> very<00:04:47.590> straight

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
we want that vine to grow very straight

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.899 
we want that vine to grow very straight
up<00:04:48.370> along<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.539> support<00:04:50.139> stake<00:04:50.860> or<00:04:51.159> rod

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.649 
up along the that support stake or rod
and<00:04:52.719> so<00:04:53.560> if<00:04:53.710> by<00:04:53.949> planting<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.610> right<00:04:55.300> adjacent

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
and so if by planting it right adjacent

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
again to point out on this vine that's

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.719 
again to point out on this vine that's
probably<00:05:02.110> ten<00:05:02.319> years<00:05:02.349> old<00:05:02.710> here<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.610> the

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
probably ten years old here this is the

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.480 
probably ten years old here this is the
graft<00:05:04.000> Union<00:05:04.449> and<00:05:04.659> we're<00:05:05.319> more<00:05:05.590> than<00:05:05.830> four<00:05:06.460> or

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
graft Union and we're more than four or

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.029 
graft Union and we're more than four or
five<00:05:06.759> inches<00:05:07.150> from<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.689> soil<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.740> I'm<00:05:08.860> not

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
five inches from the soil so I'm not

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.219 
five inches from the soil so I'm not
gonna<00:05:09.189> worry<00:05:09.460> about<00:05:09.550> sign<00:05:10.120> roots<00:05:10.509> coming<00:05:11.050> off

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
gonna worry about sign roots coming off

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.209 
gonna worry about sign roots coming off
of<00:05:11.259> here<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.870> sign<00:05:14.169> was<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.529> this<00:05:14.860> case<00:05:15.039> is

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
of here and the sign was in this case is

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.279 
of here and the sign was in this case is
Cabernet<00:05:15.580> Sauvignon<00:05:15.909> taken<00:05:16.509> over<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.080> root

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
Cabernet Sauvignon taken over the root

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.230 
Cabernet Sauvignon taken over the root
stock<00:05:17.529> we<00:05:17.710> still<00:05:17.979> have<00:05:18.189> the<00:05:18.400> benefit<00:05:18.849> of<00:05:19.089> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
stock we still have the benefit of the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.570 
stock we still have the benefit of the
root<00:05:19.389> stock<00:05:19.629> that<00:05:19.810> was<00:05:19.990> planted<00:05:20.469> here<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:21.400> be

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
root stock that was planted here to be

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.149 
root stock that was planted here to be
the<00:05:21.849> provider<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.469> nutrients<00:05:23.949> of<00:05:24.099> the

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
the provider of the nutrients of the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.219 
the provider of the nutrients of the
disease<00:05:24.520> resist<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.330> insect<00:05:25.659> resistance

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
disease resist and the insect resistance

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.739 
disease resist and the insect resistance
so<00:05:26.560> we're<00:05:27.009> expecting<00:05:27.520> probably<00:05:28.120> our<00:05:28.509> first

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
so we're expecting probably our first

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:33.209 
so we're expecting probably our first
small<00:05:29.319> crop<00:05:29.680> in<00:05:30.089> two<00:05:31.089> years<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:31.830> two<00:05:32.830> harvests

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
small crop in two years and two harvests

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.570 
small crop in two years and two harvests
from<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.610> time<00:05:33.819> that<00:05:33.969> are<00:05:34.060> planted<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:35.580> we'll

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
from the time that are planted and we'll

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.480 
from the time that are planted and we'll
have<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.759> very<00:05:36.849> small<00:05:37.300> crop<00:05:37.740> fruit<00:05:38.740> if

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
have a very small crop fruit if

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.809 
have a very small crop fruit if
everything<00:05:39.939> goes<00:05:40.150> well<00:05:40.210> from<00:05:41.080> these<00:05:41.229> vines

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
everything goes well from these vines

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.659 
everything goes well from these vines
again<00:05:42.819> when<00:05:43.719> we<00:05:43.839> come<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.229> to<00:05:44.259> prune<00:05:44.710> this

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
again when we come in to prune this

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.420 
again when we come in to prune this
winter<00:05:46.149> or<00:05:46.960> next<00:05:47.409> next<00:05:47.889> spring<00:05:48.159> actually

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
winter or next next spring actually

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.429 
winter or next next spring actually
we're<00:05:48.939> going<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.120> come<00:05:49.629> down<00:05:49.779> and<00:05:49.990> prune<00:05:50.169> very

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 
we're going to come down and prune very

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.399 
we're going to come down and prune very
short<00:05:50.800> into<00:05:51.189> two<00:05:51.399> buds<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:52.029> what<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.289> the

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
short into two buds and what this is the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.990 
short into two buds and what this is the
bud<00:05:53.649> right<00:05:53.680> here<00:05:54.219> and<00:05:54.370> there's<00:05:54.520> another<00:05:54.610> butt

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
bud right here and there's another butt

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.339 
bud right here and there's another butt
here<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.360> there's<00:05:55.479> actually<00:05:55.779> one<00:05:55.899> here<00:05:56.199> but

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
here and there's actually one here but

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.439 
here and there's actually one here but
basically<00:05:57.159> it'll<00:05:57.370> be<00:05:57.460> pruned<00:05:57.759> off<00:05:57.969> and<00:05:58.180> all<00:05:58.300> of

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
basically it'll be pruned off and all of

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.050 
basically it'll be pruned off and all of
this<00:05:58.569> growth<00:05:58.779> will<00:05:59.050> go<00:05:59.500> away<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.250> give<00:06:00.879> these

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
this growth will go away and give these

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.779 
this growth will go away and give these
chant<00:06:01.419> these<00:06:01.839> vines<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.259> chance<00:06:02.649> to<00:06:03.460> really

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
chant these vines a chance to really

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.969 
chant these vines a chance to really
push<00:06:04.029> forward<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.779> we'll<00:06:05.289> just<00:06:05.500> train<00:06:05.710> one

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
push forward and we'll just train one

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.070 
push forward and we'll just train one
trunk<00:06:06.399> up<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:07.029> this<00:06:07.180> wire<00:06:07.449> here<00:06:07.779> which<00:06:07.839> is

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
trunk up to this wire here which is

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.339 
trunk up to this wire here which is
going<00:06:08.199> to<00:06:08.259> be<00:06:08.349> our<00:06:08.439> fruit<00:06:08.710> wire<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:10.349> more

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
going to be our fruit wire and more

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.079 
going to be our fruit wire and more
unlikely<00:06:11.620> all<00:06:12.009> of<00:06:12.189> these<00:06:12.339> vines<00:06:12.520> will<00:06:12.729> be<00:06:12.849> can

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
unlikely all of these vines will be can

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.820 
unlikely all of these vines will be can
prune<00:06:14.969> which<00:06:15.969> is<00:06:16.210> a<00:06:16.240> system<00:06:16.990> that<00:06:17.020> we're<00:06:17.409> using

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
prune which is a system that we're using

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.670 
prune which is a system that we're using
more<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.339> more<00:06:18.460> in<00:06:18.729> Cabernet<00:06:19.270> especially<00:06:19.990> to

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
more and more in Cabernet especially to

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.170 
more and more in Cabernet especially to
spread<00:06:21.069> that<00:06:21.250> fruit<00:06:21.520> out<00:06:21.729> verses<00:06:22.509> the<00:06:22.599> cordon

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
spread that fruit out verses the cordon

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.519 
spread that fruit out verses the cordon
so<00:06:25.180> this<00:06:25.360> will<00:06:25.479> be<00:06:25.569> our<00:06:25.599> cane<00:06:25.899> wire<00:06:26.110> these<00:06:26.379> are

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
so this will be our cane wire these are

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.980 
so this will be our cane wire these are
our<00:06:26.620> foliage<00:06:27.069> catch<00:06:27.339> wires<00:06:27.639> up<00:06:28.029> above

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.050
