00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
nice rom the only thing I noticed is the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.799 
nice rom the only thing I noticed is the
battery<00:00:37.590> stats<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.399> although<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.570> fully

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
battery stats there although it's fully

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.119 
battery stats there although it's fully
charged<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> showing<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.620> thirty<00:00:40.800> six<00:00:41.040> percent

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
charged is showing at thirty six percent

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.810 
charged is showing at thirty six percent
but<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.420> worry<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> let<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.820> let

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
but don't worry about it just let it let

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.840 
but don't worry about it just let it let
the<00:00:45.120> battery<00:00:45.629> drain<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> restart<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the battery drain out and restart it and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
the battery drain out and restart it and
then<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> should<00:00:48.899> start<00:00:49.530> working<00:00:49.770> correctly

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
then it should start working correctly

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
then it should start working correctly
so<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> alarmed<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.079> your

one more time i'll be back on this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.860 
one more time i'll be back on this
system<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.090> i<00:02:19.120> was<00:02:19.450> getting<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:20.020> 29<00:02:21.060> 29<00:02:22.060> 20<00:02:22.630> there

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
system so i was getting a 29 29 20 there

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.660 
system so i was getting a 29 29 20 there
that's<00:02:23.500> not<00:02:23.680> too<00:02:23.830> bad<00:02:23.860> i<00:02:24.040> was<00:02:24.250> getting<00:02:24.489> almost

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that's not too bad i was getting almost

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.820 
that's not too bad i was getting almost
30<00:02:25.180> through<00:02:25.709> 3200<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:29.020> pretty<00:02:29.410> cool

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830
