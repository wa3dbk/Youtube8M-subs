rewarding for us because after three
years<00:00:24.780> in<00:00:24.960> development<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.620> can<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
years in development now we can have the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.880 
years in development now we can have the
consumers<00:00:27.090> play<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.870> game<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.770> we're

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
consumers play the game so what we're

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.010 
consumers play the game so what we're
showing<00:00:29.100> now<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.580> some<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> Alex<00:00:30.480> powers

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
showing now is some of the Alex powers

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.830 
showing now is some of the Alex powers
as<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.710> mission<00:00:32.129> gently<00:00:32.579> introduces<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
as this mission gently introduces you to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.779 
as this mission gently introduces you to
a<00:00:34.170> whole<00:00:34.440> range<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> electrical<00:00:35.190> powers<00:00:35.579> sort

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
a whole range of electrical powers sort

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.910 
a whole range of electrical powers sort
of<00:00:35.850> sequentially<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.230> now<00:00:37.379> is<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.649> free

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of sequentially we see now is some free

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.710 
of sequentially we see now is some free
running<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.610> across<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:39.060> surface<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
running you can go across any surface of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.440 
running you can go across any surface of
course<00:00:39.980> Alex<00:00:40.980> basically<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.730> launch<00:00:42.240> attacks

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
course Alex basically can launch attacks

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
course Alex basically can launch attacks
from<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.930> very<00:00:43.140> high<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:44.310> know<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> height<00:00:44.880> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
from a very high you know a height of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.030 
from a very high you know a height of
course<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.630> turn<00:00:45.840> those<00:00:46.050> attacks<00:00:46.530> into

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
course and turn those attacks into

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.370 
course and turn those attacks into
aggressive<00:00:47.730> attacks<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:49.110> we've<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.350> here

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
aggressive attacks what we've got here

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.440 
aggressive attacks what we've got here
is<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:49.860> times<00:00:50.460> square<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> middle

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
is basically times square in the middle

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.990 
is basically times square in the middle
of<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.989> three-way<00:00:52.500> war<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.700> in<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:53.940> first

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of a three-way war so in this first

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
of a three-way war so in this first
mission<00:00:54.450> we<00:00:54.810> actually<00:00:55.170> flash<00:00:55.500> forward<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
mission we actually flash forward in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
mission we actually flash forward in
time<00:00:56.700> as<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.600> train<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> player<00:00:58.380> about<00:00:59.100> their

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
time as we train the player about their

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.549 
time as we train the player about their
shape-shifting<00:00:59.670> abilities<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
shape-shifting abilities so what we have

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
shape-shifting abilities so what we have
now<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.770> Alex's<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.610> grow<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.329> by

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
now is Alex's can now grow these by

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920 
now is Alex's can now grow these by
organic<00:01:04.530> claws<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.759> can<00:01:05.909> again<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.719> turn

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
organic claws it can again you can turn

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
organic claws it can again you can turn
landings<00:01:07.469> into<00:01:07.860> an<00:01:07.979> offensive<00:01:08.520> weapon<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
landings into an offensive weapon and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
landings into an offensive weapon and
essentially<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> game<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.500> asking<00:01:11.040> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
essentially what the game was asking but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.680 
essentially what the game was asking but
what<00:01:11.280> other<00:01:11.549> game<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> asking<00:01:12.150> us<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.450> here

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
what other game is asking us to do here

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.810 
what other game is asking us to do here
is<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> take<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.680> number<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.340> black<00:01:14.580> white

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is to take out a number of black white

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.930 
is to take out a number of black white
soldiers<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.620> our<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.280> progress

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
soldiers as we make our way and progress

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750 
soldiers as we make our way and progress
down<00:01:18.330> Times<00:01:18.900> Square<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.920> Black<00:01:20.190> Watch<00:01:20.400> send

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
down Times Square the Black Watch send

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.700 
down Times Square the Black Watch send
that<00:01:20.909> bigger<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.330> bigger<00:01:21.560> reinforcements<00:01:22.560> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that bigger and bigger reinforcements in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.250 
that bigger and bigger reinforcements in
to<00:01:23.250> attack<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.450> prototype<00:01:24.900> lets<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
to attack the prototype lets you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.469 
to attack the prototype lets you
actually<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.920> hand-to-hand<00:01:26.549> weapons<00:01:27.299> as

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
actually use hand-to-hand weapons as

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
actually use hand-to-hand weapons as
well<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.650> huge<00:01:29.010> range<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
well as all the huge range of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.570 
well as all the huge range of
shape-shifting<00:01:30.330> powers<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.409> example<00:01:31.860> rocket

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
shape-shifting powers for example rocket

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.789 
shape-shifting powers for example rocket
launches<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.450> rifles<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.650> can

launches we have rifles you can

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
launches we have rifles you can
essentially<00:01:35.189> consume<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.659> enemies<00:01:37.080> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
essentially consume your enemies and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
essentially consume your enemies and
take<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.040> weapons<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> their<00:01:39.090> hand<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
in a run-and-gun style you really could

originally envisioned or has it kind of
developed<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:20.970> different<00:04:21.450> ways<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.870> think

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
developed in different ways I think

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.020 
developed in different ways I think
along<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:23.070> way<00:04:23.190> obviously<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.880> know

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030

along the way obviously that you know
along<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.540> way<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.750> any<00:04:24.900> such<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.140> lot<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.530> any

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
along the way of any such a lot of any

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.590 
along the way of any such a lot of any
long<00:04:25.950> game<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.550> development<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.360> you

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
long game and development like this you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.390 
long game and development like this you
definitely<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:28.170> tweaks<00:04:28.500> tweaks<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
definitely have tweaks tweaks and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400 
definitely have tweaks tweaks and
changes<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.790> modifications<00:04:30.170> but<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.320> be

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
changes and modifications but to be

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.750 
changes and modifications but to be
honest<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.710> last<00:04:31.980> eight<00:04:32.250> months<00:04:32.460> we've
