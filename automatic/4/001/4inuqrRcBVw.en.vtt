see I really do enjoy the transitions it
has<00:00:28.500> from<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> terrain<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> track

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
has from the terrain and the track

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.389 
has from the terrain and the track
itself<00:00:30.320> there's<00:00:31.320> multiple<00:00:31.800> times<00:00:32.040> during

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
itself there's multiple times during

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.770 
itself there's multiple times during
this<00:00:32.610> track<00:00:32.880> where<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.390> track<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
this track where you go from track to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.440 
this track where you go from track to
train<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.530> track<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.579> terrain<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.270> back

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
train to track to terrain you know back

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.030 
train to track to terrain you know back
and<00:00:36.600> forth<00:00:36.660> back<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.020> forth<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.950> know

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and forth back and forth I don't know

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530 
and forth back and forth I don't know
what<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.820> happened<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.239> those<00:00:39.360> two

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
what those what happened with those two

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.319 
what those what happened with those two
mom<00:00:39.809> uses<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.620> flipping<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
mom uses back there flipping like that

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.369 
mom uses back there flipping like that
but<00:00:42.329> anyway<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> little

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
but anyway I do like that little

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
but anyway I do like that little
transition<00:00:43.890> between<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.520> two<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
transition between those two and I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
transition between those two and I
actually<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.530> enjoyed<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.890> part

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
actually I really enjoyed this part

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.630 
actually I really enjoyed this part
coming<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.120> jump<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.640> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
coming up this jump right here and this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
coming up this jump right here and this
little<00:00:50.850> intersection<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.570> guess<00:00:51.750> after<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
little intersection I guess after this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.220 
little intersection I guess after this
turn<00:00:53.090> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.390> around<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.780> turn<00:00:54.989> right

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
turn as you come around this turn right

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.189 
turn as you come around this turn right
here<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.180> just<00:00:57.180> enjoyed<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> fact<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
here I just enjoyed the fact that you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.060 
here I just enjoyed the fact that you
know<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> possibility<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
know there's a possibility of you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.380 
know there's a possibility of you
hitting<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.550> races<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.180> going

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
hitting the other races that are going

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
hitting the other races that are going
over<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> jump<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.920> yeah<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.520> really

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
over the jump but yeah I just really

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
over the jump but yeah I just really
enjoy<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> feature<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> from

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
enjoy that feature and you can see from

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
enjoy that feature and you can see from
some<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> these<00:01:05.570> transitions<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.659> terrain

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
some of these transitions from terrain

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
some of these transitions from terrain
and<00:01:07.380> track<00:01:07.890> itself<00:01:08.220> somewhere<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> little

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and track itself somewhere just a little

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
and track itself somewhere just a little
bit<00:01:09.510> bumpy<00:01:09.979> which<00:01:10.979> isn't<00:01:11.159> necessarily<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.820> bad

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
bit bumpy which isn't necessarily a bad

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
bit bumpy which isn't necessarily a bad
thing<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.540> mean<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.810> better<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
thing I mean it's better to have it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing I mean it's better to have it
smooth<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.270> it's<00:01:15.270> still

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
smooth but that's you know it's still

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
smooth but that's you know it's still
very<00:01:15.600> enjoyable<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.310> never<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> enough

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
very enjoyable and it never was enough

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
very enjoyable and it never was enough
to<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:18.540> flip<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.290> Mongoose<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.310> know

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to actually flip my Mongoose or you know

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550 
to actually flip my Mongoose or you know
slow<00:01:20.670> me<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.850> big<00:01:21.240> time<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> big

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
slow me down big time so it's not a big

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.660 
slow me down big time so it's not a big
problem<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> little

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
problem and that there was a little

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
problem and that there was a little
sharp<00:01:23.880> turn<00:01:24.090> their<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.170> throws<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
sharp turn their that kind of throws you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
sharp turn their that kind of throws you
off<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.070> paying<00:01:26.280> attention<00:01:27.170> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
off if you're not paying attention but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
off if you're not paying attention but
again<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.130> never<00:01:29.369> enough<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.820> just

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
again you know it's never enough to just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
again you know it's never enough to just
completely<00:01:30.600> ruin<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.619> race<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.040> whatever

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
completely ruin your race or whatever

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.370 
completely ruin your race or whatever
like<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> big<00:01:33.270> deal<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
like that so it's not a big deal as you

gameplay but for some reason during some
of<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.560> Tom's<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.770> think<00:02:29.980> I've<00:02:30.040> raced<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.430> like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
of the Tom's I think I've raced it like

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.220 
of the Tom's I think I've raced it like
five<00:02:30.730> or<00:02:30.910> six<00:02:31.090> times<00:02:31.150> five<00:02:31.600> or<00:02:31.750> six<00:02:31.870> deer<00:02:32.020> came

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
five or six times five or six deer came

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.650 
five or six times five or six deer came
home<00:02:32.410> there's<00:02:32.590> some<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> times<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> was

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
home there's some of the times if I was

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.210 
home there's some of the times if I was
going<00:02:34.810> full<00:02:35.110> speed<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.800> trying<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.040> cut

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
going full speed and just trying to cut

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
going full speed and just trying to cut
it<00:02:36.340> really<00:02:36.460> really<00:02:36.730> sharp<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.270> would<00:02:37.390> flip<00:02:37.690> my

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it really really sharp it would flip my

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.950 
it really really sharp it would flip my
Mongoose<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.470> don't<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.070> why<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.280> did<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.960> it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
Mongoose I don't know why I did that it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.840 
Mongoose I don't know why I did that it
doesn't<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.500> usually<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.310> happened

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
doesn't do that usually it just happened

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.400 
doesn't do that usually it just happened
a<00:02:43.090> couple<00:02:43.240> times<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:46.720> normal

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
a couple times so it's not like a normal

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.320 
a couple times so it's not like a normal
occurrence<00:02:48.130> or<00:02:48.370> whatever<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.850> some<00:02:49.060> big<00:02:49.180> deal

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
occurrence or whatever so some big deal

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.690 
occurrence or whatever so some big deal
but<00:02:49.930> that's<00:02:50.200> one<00:02:50.410> thing<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.430> all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
but that's one thing that I that's all

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.940 
but that's one thing that I that's all
about<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.090> map<00:02:52.300> well<00:02:53.080> other<00:02:53.560> than<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.860> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
about this map well other than that you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.630 
about this map well other than that you
know<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.370> definitely<00:02:54.910> really<00:02:55.210> exciting<00:02:55.690> map

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
know it's definitely really exciting map

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.370 
know it's definitely really exciting map
you<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.730> I've<00:02:57.970> never<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.480> mean<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.990> think<00:02:59.080> I've

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
you know I've never I mean I think I've

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.320 
you know I've never I mean I think I've
might<00:02:59.710> have<00:02:59.890> heard<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.280> guy<00:03:00.460> maybe<00:03:00.970> one

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
might have heard of this guy maybe one

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.120 
might have heard of this guy maybe one
map<00:03:01.510> possibly<00:03:02.320> he<00:03:02.470> might<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.710> sent<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> me

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
map possibly he might have sent it to me

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.100 
map possibly he might have sent it to me
before<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.720> other<00:03:04.720> than<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.989> really

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
before but other than that I really

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840

good map um in this games that might be
a<00:03:46.270> little<00:03:46.390> bit<00:03:46.540> laggy<00:03:46.720> I'm<00:03:46.989> not<00:03:47.140> sure<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
a little bit laggy I'm not sure the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.570 
a little bit laggy I'm not sure the
video<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.800> going<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:47.980> be<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.130> little<00:03:48.280> bit<00:03:48.430> laggy

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
video is going to be a little bit laggy

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.520 
video is going to be a little bit laggy
for<00:03:48.760> y'all<00:03:49.030> are<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.660> know<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.930> gameplay

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
for y'all are like you know the gameplay

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.430 
for y'all are like you know the gameplay
whatever<00:03:50.800> because<00:03:51.580> we<00:03:52.000> have<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.510> 12<00:03:53.230> people

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
whatever because we have like 12 people

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.960 
whatever because we have like 12 people
in<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.100> was<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.430> little<00:03:54.580> bit<00:03:54.790> laggy

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
in it so it was just a little bit laggy

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.420 
in it so it was just a little bit laggy
not<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.840> huge<00:03:56.200> deal<00:03:56.410> though<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.890> about<00:03:57.370> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
not a huge deal though and about the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.090 
not a huge deal though and about the
elevator<00:03:58.000> sometimes<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.260> mean<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.650> always<00:03:59.800> like

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
elevator sometimes I mean it always like

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.470 
elevator sometimes I mean it always like
if<00:04:00.250> you're<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.640> by<00:04:00.730> yourself<00:04:00.880> usually

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
if you're going by yourself usually

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.650 
if you're going by yourself usually
always<00:04:01.630> works<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.590> sometimes<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.910> guess<00:04:04.510> if

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
always works but sometimes I guess if

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.390 
always works but sometimes I guess if
you<00:04:04.750> hit<00:04:04.959> like<00:04:05.140> one<00:04:05.440> wrong<00:04:05.709> side<00:04:05.950> it'll<00:04:06.250> make

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
you hit like one wrong side it'll make

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.540 
you hit like one wrong side it'll make
you<00:04:06.550> all

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
you all

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.280 
you all
to<00:04:07.610> do<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:07.940> flip<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.450> go<00:04:08.600> almost<00:04:08.780> kind<00:04:09.230> of

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
to do like a flip you go almost kind of

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.260 
to do like a flip you go almost kind of
straight<00:04:09.530> up<00:04:09.710> but<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.980> still<00:04:10.190> land<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.150> it's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
straight up but you still land so it's

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.880 
straight up but you still land so it's
not<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.450> big<00:04:11.600> deal<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:12.170> was<00:04:12.260> one<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.530> floss

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
not a big deal that was one little floss

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.160 
not a big deal that was one little floss
on<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:14.420> course<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.840> know<00:04:14.960> if<00:04:15.050> you're

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
on that and of course you know if you're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.530 
on that and of course you know if you're
going<00:04:15.320> in<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.860> first<00:04:16.040> lap<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.790> think<00:04:17.420> they

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
going in like the first lap I think they

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.330 
going in like the first lap I think they
like<00:04:17.690> four<00:04:17.959> or<00:04:18.019> five<00:04:18.049> people<00:04:18.320> flip<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.890> then

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
like four or five people flip and then

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.610 
like four or five people flip and then
you<00:04:19.730> know<00:04:19.850> that's<00:04:20.090> it's<00:04:20.660> kind<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:20.989> hard<00:04:21.530> to

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
you know that's it's kind of hard to

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.920 
you know that's it's kind of hard to
stop<00:04:21.950> seeing<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.700> know<00:04:22.850> any<00:04:23.270> elevator<00:04:23.780> you're

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.560 
gonna have ten people going there's no
way<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.580> gonna<00:04:25.640> be<00:04:25.760> perfect<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.420> can't

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
way it's gonna be perfect so you can't

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.540 
way it's gonna be perfect so you can't
really<00:04:26.630> do<00:04:26.870> anything<00:04:27.020> about<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.490> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
so and actually this is really pretty

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.920 
so and actually this is really pretty
smooth<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.520> transition<00:04:50.390> between<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
smooth the transition between the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.780 
smooth the transition between the
teleport<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.500> track<00:04:51.740> itself<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.310> as<00:04:52.670> you

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
teleport on the track itself and as you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.160 
teleport on the track itself and as you
can<00:04:52.910> see<00:04:52.940> there's<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.330> lag<00:04:53.570> right<00:04:53.750> there<00:04:53.960> where

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
can see there's a lag right there where

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.240 
can see there's a lag right there where
you<00:04:54.260> completely<00:04:54.650> went<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.010> player<00:04:55.220> I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
you completely went to that player I

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.380 
you completely went to that player I
don't<00:04:55.550> know<00:04:55.610> how<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.790> happened<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.450> uh<00:04:57.100> yeah

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
don't know how that happened but uh yeah

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.180 
don't know how that happened but uh yeah
so<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.450> know<00:04:59.660> definitely<00:05:00.170> both<00:05:00.620> are<00:05:00.890> really

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
so you know definitely both are really

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.520 
so you know definitely both are really
good<00:05:01.430> maps<00:05:01.670> and<00:05:01.910> stuff<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.810> there's<00:05:03.290> gonna<00:05:03.380> be
