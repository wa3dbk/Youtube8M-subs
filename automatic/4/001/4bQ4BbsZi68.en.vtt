00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 Hi, I'm the good doctor and this is 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.930
 clear medicine your medicine channel 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.990
 on the internet today we are going to address the issue 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.869
 of vaccination against the virus of the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.390
 human papilloma for all those who 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.740
 you have not heard about this virus or 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.279
 that you have started your relationships 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 sex and you are starting to hear 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 this this virus that can affect you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.180
 can cause cancer that if you vaccinate 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.519
 Look at you to see, I'll tell you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 four little things about what the virus is 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.600
 of the human papilloma and then we will enter 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.239
 a little more in detail about the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 benefits and side effects of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.600
 Vaccination against the virus of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 human papilloma 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.879
 as its name suggests is an infection 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.339
 virus that is spread through the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.489
 mucous membranes of the male genitalia or 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.250
 Feminine penetration is not necessary 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 but simply with the contact of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.899
 skin with skin may already be enough 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.080
 contagion there are 140 different subtypes 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.340
 of the human papilloma virus is true 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.579
 that only 40 of them cause 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.329
 important meanings and only 15 of 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.450
 these 140 are responsible for what 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.119
 can cause cancer of the cervix 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.030
 uterine virus infection 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.329
 usually does not cause any kind of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.630
 symptom in some people you can 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.390
 cause then certain irritation certain 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.289
 burning in the walls of the vagina and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.470
 unless the typical warts appear 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.140
 of the papilloma patients will contribute 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 the virus and they're not going to have any kind of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 symptom 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.149
 because there are some groups of the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 viruses that are considered high 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.039
 risk because they can develop this 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.659
 Cervical cancer this neck cancer 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.259
 of uterus that is as they say 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.550
 they have usually appeared 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.410
 two vaccines commercialized one that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.190
 encompasses four subtypes of the virus and 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.220
 two others that can help prevent 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.800
 the onset of this uterine cancer 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.349
 There is some doubt and controversy because 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.959
 until you take several decades no 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.989
 we will be able to determine with reliability 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.780
 the results of this vaccine since it 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.230
 It takes a long time for the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.739
 precancerous lesions caused by 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.800
 virus and keep changing and develop in 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.739
 the future a cancer of the cervix but 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.440
 currently there are those two vaccines and 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.870
 is a therapeutic option for those 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.080
 women who wish to be vaccinated against 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.540
 human papilloma virus in 2015 it 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.329
 wait for a new vaccine to appear 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 attack on 9 different subtypes of the virus 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.129
 of the human papilloma 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.319
 but what you have to be very clear 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.920
 is that those women that you have 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.739
 vaccinated the vaccine does not prevent having 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.170
 Cervical cancer is true that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.620
 it prevents it in a very high percentage 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.470
 but it does not prevent it therefore those 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 sexually active women who do not know 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.760
 forget two things one practice sex 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.000
 safe with the use of 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.519
 condoms and two be made 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.579
 routine tests in your gynecologist 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.750
 among which the most important is the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.670
 cytology or pap test 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.770
 this has been clear medicine with the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.710
 good doctor I hope this video has 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.050
 solved the doubts that you had for 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.820
 course this explanation in no 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.070
 moment substitutes the advice of 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.170
