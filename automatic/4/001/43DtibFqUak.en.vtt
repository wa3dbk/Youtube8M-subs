a member of our heritage series of
acoustic<00:00:23.869> guitars<00:00:24.169> this<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.039> WUF<00:00:25.519> 11<00:00:26.119> SCE

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
acoustic guitars this is the WUF 11 SCE

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.130 
acoustic guitars this is the WUF 11 SCE
acoustic<00:00:27.349> electric<00:00:27.579> folk<00:00:28.579> sized<00:00:28.880> guitar<00:00:29.390> it's

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
acoustic electric folk sized guitar it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.049 
acoustic electric folk sized guitar it's
a<00:00:30.199> little<00:00:30.410> smaller<00:00:30.680> than<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.919> dreadnought<00:00:31.220> it's

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
a little smaller than a dreadnought it's

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.460 
a little smaller than a dreadnought it's
also<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:32.419> little<00:00:32.570> narrower<00:00:33.050> than<00:00:33.350> a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
also a little narrower than a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.030 
also a little narrower than a
dreadnought

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
dreadnought

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.130 
dreadnought
so<00:00:34.220> it's<00:00:35.030> going<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.239> be<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.570> little<00:00:35.870> smaller

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
so it's going to be a little smaller

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.950 
so it's going to be a little smaller
sounding<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:36.830> more<00:00:37.070> articulate<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.809> is

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
sounding but more articulate and this is

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.479 
sounding but more articulate and this is
an<00:00:39.199> ideal<00:00:39.530> guitar<00:00:40.010> if<00:00:40.250> you're<00:00:40.430> a

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
an ideal guitar if you're a

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.119 
an ideal guitar if you're a
singer-songwriter<00:00:41.300> if<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:41.780> perform<00:00:42.379> open

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
singer-songwriter if you perform open

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.060 
singer-songwriter if you perform open
mics<00:00:43.659> also<00:00:44.659> for<00:00:44.870> smaller<00:00:45.199> statute<00:00:45.739> people

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
mics also for smaller statute people

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.319 
mics also for smaller statute people
because<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.489> smaller<00:00:46.760> body<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:47.239> going

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
because of the smaller body it's going

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.569 
because of the smaller body it's going
to<00:00:47.420> be<00:00:47.480> more<00:00:47.659> comfortable<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.230> play<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.400> let's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
preamp if you run into phase issues you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.370 
preamp if you run into phase issues you
flip<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.330> switch<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.050> rid<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.260> your
