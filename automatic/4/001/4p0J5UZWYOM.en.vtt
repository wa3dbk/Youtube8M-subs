hey everyone so here is my first
commentary<00:00:06.000> I'm<00:00:06.450> gonna<00:00:06.660> be<00:00:06.810> talking<00:00:07.140> about

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
commentary I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.129 
commentary I'm gonna be talking about
the<00:00:07.529> kill<00:00:07.830> zone<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.309> sniper<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.630> still<00:00:09.900> see

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the kill zone to sniper and I still see

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.620 
the kill zone to sniper and I still see
a<00:00:10.170> lot<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.500> new<00:00:10.710> players<00:00:11.160> online<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
a lot of new players online so this is

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.259 
a lot of new players online so this is
relevant<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.500> least<00:00:13.679> until<00:00:14.070> ozone<00:00:14.700> 3<00:00:15.030> comes

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
relevant at least until ozone 3 comes

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.380 
relevant at least until ozone 3 comes
out<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.080> month<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> here's<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.850> basically

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
out in a month so here's just basically

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.290 
out in a month so here's just basically
how<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.720> unlock<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.439> secondary<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
how you unlock the secondary and the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.650 
how you unlock the secondary and the
times<00:00:21.869> 5<00:00:22.199> zoom<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> gun<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.570> I'm

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
times 5 zoom on the gun what you see I'm

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
times 5 zoom on the gun what you see I'm
showing<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.080> right<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.460> you're

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
showing you right now and when you're

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.839 
showing you right now and when you're
close<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.119> screen<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.779> turn<00:00:28.170> blue<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
close to your screen will turn blue so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.990 
close to your screen will turn blue so
here's<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.210> happens<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.019> damaged

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
here's what happens if you get damaged

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
here's what happens if you get damaged
while<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.239> cloaked<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.079> while<00:00:34.200> you're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
while you're cloaked in and while you're

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
while you're cloaked in and while you're
scoped<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.460> you're<00:00:35.579> close

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
scoped in you can see if you're close

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.330 
scoped in you can see if you're close
enough<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:36.570> explosion<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.160> get

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
enough to an explosion you will get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
enough to an explosion you will get
knocked<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.030> scope<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:40.140> you're

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
knocked out of your scope and if you're

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
knocked out of your scope and if you're
far<00:00:40.500> enough<00:00:40.680> away<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.219> explosion<00:00:41.579> your

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
far enough away from an explosion your

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.229 
far enough away from an explosion your
scope<00:00:42.390> will<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.809> sway<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.309> if

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
scope will just sway a little bit and if

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
scope will just sway a little bit and if
you<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.480> damaged<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.860> cloak<00:00:47.190> will

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you get damaged at all your cloak will

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.729 
you get damaged at all your cloak will
disappear<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
disappear so that's just something to be

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.580 
disappear so that's just something to be
aware<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:51.930> trying<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
aware of and I was actually trying to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
aware of and I was actually trying to
run<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> wall<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.969> show<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> guys<00:00:54.449> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
run to that wall to show you guys some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
run to that wall to show you guys some
of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> bullet<00:00:55.289> spray<00:00:55.590> when<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> ran<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of the bullet spray when I ran into this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.619 
of the bullet spray when I ran into this
little<00:00:57.600> dummy<00:00:58.079> ai<00:00:58.350> guy<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.210> shooting<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
little dummy ai guy and I'm shooting a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.160 
little dummy ai guy and I'm shooting a
turret<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.520> every<00:01:02.520> type<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.480> machinery

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
turret now every type of machinery

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.179 
turret now every type of machinery
basically<00:01:04.860> takes<00:01:05.129> three<00:01:05.580> shots<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.270> kill<00:01:07.189> an

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
basically takes three shots to kill an

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
basically takes three shots to kill an
enemy<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.299> unless<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.110> an

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
enemy will take one unless it's an

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.149 
enemy will take one unless it's an
assault<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.890> takes<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.670> bullets<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> kill

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
assault which takes two bullets to kill

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.420 
assault which takes two bullets to kill
so<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.590> recoil<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so here is just a look at recoil and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
so here is just a look at recoil and
accuracy<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.450> scoped<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
accuracy when you're scoped in the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.940 
accuracy when you're scoped in the
bullet<00:01:19.470> hits<00:01:20.100> perfectly<00:01:20.880> every<00:01:21.119> single<00:01:21.150> time

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
bullet hits perfectly every single time

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
bullet hits perfectly every single time
there's<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> sway<00:01:23.820> after<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
there's a little bit of sway after you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
there's a little bit of sway after you
take<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.900> shot<00:01:25.290> though<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
take your shot though but now you can

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
take your shot though but now you can
see<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.009> try<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> noscope<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
see that when I try to noscope the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.520 
see that when I try to noscope the
bullet<00:01:31.590> flies<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.340> over<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> place<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.630> I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
bullet flies all over the place and I'm

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
bullet flies all over the place and I'm
not<00:01:34.740> even<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.070> far<00:01:35.400> away<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> wall

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
not even that far away from the wall

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
not even that far away from the wall
right<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.079> no<00:01:37.470> scoping<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> pretty

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right now so no scoping is pretty

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
right now so no scoping is pretty
difficult<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.960> fun<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
difficult but pretty fun as well so it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
difficult but pretty fun as well so it
takes<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:42.990> half<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:44.070> second<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> zoom<00:01:44.850> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
takes about half a second to zoom in

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
takes about half a second to zoom in
there's<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.439> seconds<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> sway<00:01:47.250> if

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
there's about two seconds of sway if

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.480 
there's about two seconds of sway if
you're<00:01:47.729> scoped<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> take<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> shot<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
you're scoped in and you take a shot and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
you're scoped in and you take a shot and
reloading<00:01:50.490> takes<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.030> four<00:01:51.509> seconds<00:01:52.189> so

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
reloading takes about four seconds so

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
reloading takes about four seconds so
the<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.490> thing<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.970> should<00:01:54.240> definitely<00:01:54.590> be

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the one thing you should definitely be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
the one thing you should definitely be
familiar<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.820> comfortable<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.420> doing

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
familiar and be comfortable with doing

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
familiar and be comfortable with doing
is<00:01:58.049> pulling<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.680> secondary<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
is pulling out your secondary in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.219 
is pulling out your secondary in
close-quarter<00:02:00.390> situations

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
close-quarter situations

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.569 
close-quarter situations
because<00:02:02.920> noscoping<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.700> not<00:02:04.000> very<00:02:04.530> accurate

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
because noscoping is not very accurate

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.479 
because noscoping is not very accurate
it's<00:02:06.579> not<00:02:06.789> very<00:02:07.060> reliable<00:02:07.769> so<00:02:08.769> these<00:02:08.890> next<00:02:09.160> few

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
it's not very reliable so these next few

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.670 
it's not very reliable so these next few
clips<00:02:09.789> er<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.149> need<00:02:10.450> trying<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.379> quickscope

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
clips er just need trying to quickscope

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.460 
clips er just need trying to quickscope
just<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.819> get<00:02:12.970> rid<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.330> variability<00:02:13.989> in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
just to get rid of that variability in

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.830 
just to get rid of that variability in
the<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.769> know<00:02:14.890> scope<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.450> isn't

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the you know scope but really this isn't

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350
