00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.280

 taco bell ajÃ¡ esteban have it and of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.320
 background today we 're talking about 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.570
 whites 3 if this one is going to come out of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.369
 playstation 3 and xbox crisis ti this is 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.800
 something that normally is not discussed 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.380
 because it is known that it is going to be imply they are 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.510
 three times you did but this year 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.310
 in all ads all trailers 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.560
 cannes a fords of black ops 3 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.660
 no side has left that will follow a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.670
 playstation 3 or in poster did you do 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.870
 when he really knows only he knows 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.639
 playstation 4 xbox one ipc this so 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.699
 is what we have confirmed here that 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.889
 they tell us the page to get informed 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.960
 little more than an ad this one that said 

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.749
 that yes that will come out of this prestige 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.179
 between passion reflection lacoste 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.190
 playstation 3 and in you crisis you this 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.629
 that is there confirmed and then a 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.380
 page as well as that removes it so that it 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.720
 he has relied on that 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.030
 and then for the reasons why 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.040
 I thought that I was not going to leave for the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.810
 playstation3 and post did you do it because 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.810
 is announced nowhere any in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.390
 cannes trailers is going to be the cob 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.680
 be and also because we are the new 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.020
 generation of consoles is a 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.659
 playstation 4 xbox wang and ipc that 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.509
 I was always before 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.609
 and then there are limitations that the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.719
 other consoles that said a thousand times 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:27.399
 you voted and playstation 3 that does not let 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.859
 you can reach the potential of the game what 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.869
 maximum possible this there are things that for 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.090
 example this when from this one but you have 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.939
 a ball that they wanted to expand certain 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.340
 things and they endured because in desserts 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.170
 and whenever I came in I did not have in the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.750
 memory do not have the ability to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.719
 do it because they said that what 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.060
 they could play playstation 4 and time 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.679
 when this one because they wanted like that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.229
 have they do it for the one who does not have 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.000
 advantage over others and that's why 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.929
 because bad that every one game like that without 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.579
 think that as if they want to sup 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.189
 maximum a game that they do it without 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.020
 worry about other consoles that are 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.849
 in boat and playstation 3 that stay 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.679
 endured only because he does not want 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.899
 do with that unfair do not want to see that 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.180
 we are in this mud with mentality 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.250
 so honestly I think that the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 Playstation 3 is better than precision 4 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.240
 that you like better than xbox moon no 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.220
 it makes no sense this 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.900
 have more memory are faster they have 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.420
 more ability to do more things right 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.180
 what are you doing that is not going down 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.460
 are improving this as a console and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.230
 it may be the reason why you thought 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.510
 that I was not going to leave this for these 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.460
 consoles are probably what what 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.980
 They are also saying that another company 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.540
 he leaves is not company but as the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.330
 section we will leave as the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.760
 playstation 3 and xbox crisis and they are going to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.250
 focus more on playstation 4 juanin pc 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.470
 as he said and they will try to take out 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.030
 normal live game and nothing is 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.280
 basically everything I wanted today 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.520
 let me know if you are still 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.530
 in industry city it 's sad and playstation 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.300
 3 or already did as I think the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.340
 new consoles or think purchases in 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.990
 some time and nothing because he liked the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.730
 video liked as always the light of 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.950
 day 50 g subscribe has been made yet 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.360

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.370
