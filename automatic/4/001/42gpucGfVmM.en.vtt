00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 I can stay a little bit on the subject 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.700
 oriental today the kitchen of ever person 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.610
 from the natives will take on the appearance more 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.759
 sort of the Chinese restaurant indeed the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 menu provides an oriental habituÃ© that is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.680
 the sweet and sour chicken as usual 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 but I want to personalize the recipe 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 and adapt it to my needs or to have me 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.310
 put your hands a little and has some 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.710
 modified something as we know the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 original recipe for sweet and sour chicken 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 provides for the use of chicken clearly 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 and then some pineapples and peppers 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 will be accompanied with the classic sauce 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.360
 sweet and sour tomato vinegar based 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 sugar and water here but I would like 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.719
 replace the not so coleen melon and me 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 I will say that this combination is a lot 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.280
 interesting we find out together what is there 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 needed to prepare the chicken in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
 sweet and sour year domain are necessary 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.570
 half a chicken breast already cut a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 small pieces weighing about 400 grams 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 then 300 g of melon pulp 200 g of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 then terribly yellow pepper 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 we still have to thicken 30 grams 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 of rice flour or fertility 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 silent as you like best half 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
 small glass of brandy a drop of oil 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 extra virgin olive oil a pinch of salt 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 and then about 200 grams of sauce 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 sweet and sour we first cleaned 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.570
 for benin which, however, did not remove the seeds 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 in purely terms we have cut to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 the same thing we did 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.610
 with the melon, however, given by 100 grams 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.979
 we got 300 g of pulp and this 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 we split it into balls 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 will be used to decorate the dish and then 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.450
 from the reminder we have obtained 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.640
 of irregular pieces of merone 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 now what to do we prepare the sauce of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.979
 accompaniment for our neck 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.380
 so first let's go brown 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.189
 the peppers so we raise the heat 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.229
 we always do our test 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.360
 water to see if the pot is 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.420
 ready you see that the polygon droplets 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 immediately so we can also pay the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.399
 our bell pepper and toast it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.610
 let's brown alone without 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.890
 add the melon otherwise you won't 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.880
 would be able to form the china race with 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 kansas pepper because melon 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.069
 the ports would go away immediately 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.750
 we add oil feeling it serves 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.549
 abound on a fine is sufficient 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.140
 let's mix a little like that 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.690
 if we brown at the central call 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.000
 for about a couple of minutes per side with 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.430
 the cover 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.230
 now our red peppers are browned a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.920
 you see little that they are beautiful 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.980
 often we can also add the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.410
 our melon that you will see that though 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.130
 for themselves keep a flame 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.780
 however the melon is rather strong 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.930
 this being rather even mature 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.030
 lawn will melt easily that it was 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.030
 also an interesting subject 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 we go up and we have not added salt 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:20.030
 first ok 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.920
 mix a little more and mix it 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
 from time to time to prevent it being pc 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.079
 that until the vegetables are cooked and the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.700
 fruit also in this case we are one 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.739
 can kill our chicken 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.510
 so we don't go up it has already been cut 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.980
 in small pieces from my butcher of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.980
 trust or new dad 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.439
 we also mix a little with our hands or 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.599
 so I armed gloves there as 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:50.180
 as usual and now we pass you quickly 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.829
 on potato starch or on 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.530
 rice flour I did not choose the 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.500
 wheat flour simply to make 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.989
 eat this dish also to who it is 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.790
 suffering from celiac disease we have sprinkled with 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.040
 rice flour our powder and 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.909
 now we can more numerous give it in 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.829
 cooking pan 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.689
 I exchanged the cost of the pans 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.909
 I already poured 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:14.450
 inside our pan e 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:18.699
 now we can prepare a color we can 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.699
 proceed to brown our pieces 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.280
 now that our chicken has browned 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.440
 for good on all sides 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.370
 we can also spend a little bit there 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.660
 flame and blend with the brandy 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.020
 attention you will be free flames because 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.270
 you can set the kitchen on fire 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:47.050
 immediately close the flame down 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:51.700
 mix so simply by shaking the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.160
 pot calculated some time and time 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:01.420
 clearly the brandy will be absorbed 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:04.240
 almost and now we can also add the 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.940
 our vegetables you see there are and are 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.810
 soften well 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.810
 we add here 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.260
 and this is the first part of the 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.260
 wealth 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.810
 then stir a little and then short 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.420
 argue with the cover and continue with the 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.430
 cooking always on a fairly sweet heat 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.740
 in other words, for about 5 6 minutes up to 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.670
 when the heart of chicken nuggets 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.340
 at this point many recipes will be cooked 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.680
 suggest reaching this sauce 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.680
 sweet and sour prepared with 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.540
 tomato then vinegar sugar water again 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.460
 and other ingredients 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.930
 I said some recent suggests of 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.490
 add the sex directly 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.900
 inside the chicken 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.190
 I have prepared one of mine 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.380
 recent precedents so if you want 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.360
 speak it to you at home you can click here 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.830
 where you will find notes all over 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.930
 carrying out the recipes otherwise 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.760
 you can also buy it ready for 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.370
 who also see it already ready 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.110
 but I don't add it directly 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.260
 chicken because maybe I don't have all of them 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.540
 there was a couple so I love to combine it 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.500
 maybe match the chicken with the sauce 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.300
 with the sauce aside to please a 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.760
 all the tastes I thought of 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.220
 offer you my chicken in sweet and sour sauce 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.900
 in two versions therefore a dish it 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.480
 we will do with the sauce part while 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.300
 in the other we will place him on a bed of 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.110
 sweet and sour sauce so now here 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.110
 let's make the bowls 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.070
 and then now we always take some 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.070
 sauce in a dish 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:04.370
 now we see our neck like me here 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:07.670
 I would say that cooking is also optimal 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:11.040
 so we can also turn it off 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.770
 and we are going to implant later 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.780
 we are going to decorate our chicken with 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:22.170
 the melon balls that we have before 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:24.090
 prepared by a good lover of contrasts 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.040
 meat is all here I have to say this 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.190
 flat is just inviting now 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.020
 let's take the piece of 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.530
 stamp I have to leave you to finish in the 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.530
 cul in mouth
