take a look at the the war machine set

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
take a look at the the war machine set
and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.410> low<00:00:40.410> gimmicky<00:00:41.100> Ultron<00:00:41.699> thingy<00:00:42.000> which

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and the low gimmicky Ultron thingy which

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.130 
and the low gimmicky Ultron thingy which
is<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:44.449> don't<00:00:45.449> even<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
is I don't even know what this is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
is I don't even know what this is
because<00:00:46.550> when<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> build<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.059> together

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
because when you build it all together

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
because when you build it all together
it's<00:00:48.719> supposed<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> come<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.910> come

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's supposed to come out with this come

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's supposed to come out with this come
up<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:51.390> build<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> figure<00:00:52.170> some<00:00:52.829> sort

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
up to be this build a figure some sort

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.970 
up to be this build a figure some sort
of<00:00:53.160> crazy<00:00:53.969> looking<00:00:54.390> thing<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.899> who<00:00:55.739> cares

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of crazy looking thing but who cares

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.200 
of crazy looking thing but who cares
about<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.670> here's<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:59.210> vehicle

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
about that and here's the little vehicle

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
about that and here's the little vehicle
thing<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.499> there's<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.100> Ultron

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thing and then there's the little Ultron

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.840 
thing and then there's the little Ultron
I<00:01:03.120> guess<00:01:03.929> these<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.680> show<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> something

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I guess these are to show you something

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
I guess these are to show you something
but<00:01:06.540> yeah<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.650> here's<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> war<00:01:08.280> machine

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
but yeah and then here's the war machine

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960 
but yeah and then here's the war machine
it's<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.840> nice<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:11.100> pretty

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
impressed with this even though this is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and a paint app on these figures are

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
and a paint app on these figures are
really<00:01:24.390> poor<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
really poor for some of them but the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.830 
really poor for some of them but the
scopes<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.780> nice<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.630> war

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
scopes are really nice and the the war

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.490 
scopes are really nice and the the war
machine<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.530> turned<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.250> nice

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
machine actually turned out pretty nice

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.920 
machine actually turned out pretty nice
so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.740> happy<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> pick<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.939> cost

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so I was happy to pick this up cost

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.370 
so I was happy to pick this up cost
about<00:01:37.079> $5.99<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.280> yeah<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
about $5.99 and yeah as you can see the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.899 
about $5.99 and yeah as you can see the
the<00:01:41.280> paint<00:01:41.490> job<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.180> war<00:01:42.869> machine<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
the paint job on the war machine is

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
the paint job on the war machine is
pretty<00:01:44.909> pretty<00:01:45.420> good<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:48.500> these<00:01:49.500> plastic<00:01:50.009> are

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
pretty pretty good and these plastic are

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
pretty pretty good and these plastic are
a<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.600> harder<00:01:51.600> than<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.380> expecting

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
a bit harder than what I was expecting

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.789 
a bit harder than what I was expecting
which<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> nice<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.180> usually<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.200> two

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
which is nice because usually with two

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.760 
which is nice because usually with two
inches<00:01:56.299> figures<00:01:57.299> they<00:01:58.109> tend<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
inches figures they tend to be really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
inches figures they tend to be really
softened<00:01:59.340> plastic<00:01:59.509> but<00:02:00.509> these<00:02:00.899> gak<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.740> know

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
softened plastic but these gak you know

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.029 
softened plastic but these gak you know
pretty<00:02:02.070> hard<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.329> happy<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
pretty hard so I was happy with it and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.980 
pretty hard so I was happy with it and
when<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.310> came<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.549> package<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.780> lakes

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
when I first came out package the lakes

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
when I first came out package the lakes
were<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.439> war<00:02:07.619> worked<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> had<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.240> put

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
