00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
25 years or so of being with his

25 years or so of being with his
daughter<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.180> doing<00:02:46.810> everything<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.320> could<00:02:47.380> to

like I said say good job boy that was a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.930 
like I said say good job boy that was a
that<00:03:23.020> would<00:03:23.200> mean<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> lot<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.709> me<00:03:23.920> as<00:03:24.700> far<00:03:24.910> as

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
that would mean a lot to me as far as

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.740 
that would mean a lot to me as far as
what<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.360> would<00:03:25.540> eat<00:03:27.450> there<00:03:28.450> was<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> little

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
what we would eat there was a little

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.000 
what we would eat there was a little
place<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:28.930> they're<00:03:29.230> called<00:03:29.440> little<00:03:29.800> bucks

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
place that they're called little bucks

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.560 
place that they're called little bucks
and<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.370> think<00:03:30.700> there<00:03:30.850> still<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.300> place
