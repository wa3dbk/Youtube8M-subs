you<00:01:22.759> could<00:01:22.939> then<00:01:23.060> find<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.600> star<00:01:24.049> in<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
you could then find that star in the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
you could then find that star in the
night<00:01:24.500> sky<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.700> point<00:01:25.939> on<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.090> horizon

directly<00:01:27.259> below<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.799> star<00:01:28.100> would<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.369> their

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
directly below that star would be their

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.580 
directly below that star would be their
exact<00:01:29.180> direction<00:01:29.840> from<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.259> at<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.920> moment

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
exact direction from you at that moment

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.630

unfortunately a few minutes later that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.940 
unfortunately a few minutes later that
star<00:01:35.180> would<00:01:35.329> have<00:01:35.390> moved<00:01:35.719> and<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.530> you'd<00:01:36.799> need

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
star would have moved and so you'd need

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.700 
star would have moved and so you'd need
a<00:01:37.009> new<00:01:37.280> one<00:01:37.460> with<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.539> method<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.140> would<00:01:39.439> take

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
a new one with this method it would take

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.499 
a new one with this method it would take
a<00:01:39.920> lot<00:01:40.399> of<00:01:40.640> phone<00:01:41.000> calls<00:01:41.030> for<00:01:41.659> every<00:01:42.079> new<00:01:42.259> star

a lot of phone calls for every new star
fortunately<00:01:44.509> there<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.049> one<00:01:45.170> star<00:01:45.799> in<00:01:45.920> the
