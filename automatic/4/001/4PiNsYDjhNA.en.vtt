00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.640 
here we can see the plan of the gallery
one<00:03:51.860> space<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:53.600> can<00:03:53.750> see<00:03:53.960> that<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.440> layout

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
one space you can see that the layout

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.980 
one space you can see that the layout
has<00:03:54.980> been<00:03:55.220> made<00:03:55.430> as<00:03:55.580> simple<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.300> symmetrical

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
has been made as simple and symmetrical

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.160 
has been made as simple and symmetrical
as<00:03:57.260> possible<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.790> was<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.270> accentuate

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
as possible and this was to accentuate

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.230 
as possible and this was to accentuate
the<00:04:00.350> randomness<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.340> hang<00:04:01.730> with<00:04:02.000> in<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
the randomness of the hang with in the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.560 
the randomness of the hang with in the
John<00:04:02.420> Cage<00:04:02.630> exhibition<00:04:04.000> basically<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.330> walls

half<00:04:07.910> meter<00:04:08.300> squares<00:04:08.660> each<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.860> these<00:04:09.980> has

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
half meter squares each of these has

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.060 
half meter squares each of these has
been<00:04:10.640> given<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:10.970> number<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:12.200> each<00:04:12.410> object

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
quite a few expanses of whiteness in the

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.620 
quite a few expanses of whiteness in the
room<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.800> pictures<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.910> know<00:05:14.060> are

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
placed in a way that kind of articulates

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.740 
placed in a way that kind of articulates
the<00:05:18.800> space<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:20.690> me<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.230> refers<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:22.750> music

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the space and for me it refers to music

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.270 
the space and for me it refers to music
and<00:05:23.930> sounds<00:05:24.350> as<00:05:24.470> well<00:05:24.650> there<00:05:24.860> are<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:24.980> kind<00:05:25.220> of

and sounds as well there are a kind of

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.420 
and sounds as well there are a kind of
rhythms<00:05:25.700> have<00:05:25.820> emerged<00:05:26.360> that<00:05:27.100> it's<00:05:28.100> kind<00:05:28.370> of

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
rhythms have emerged that it's kind of

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.360 
rhythms have emerged that it's kind of
very<00:05:28.580> exciting<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.780> hopefully<00:05:30.260> people<00:05:31.040> are

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
very exciting so hopefully people are

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.710 
very exciting so hopefully people are
going<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:33.280> be<00:05:34.280> able<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.550> find<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.060> accessible

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
going to be able to find that accessible

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.590 
going to be able to find that accessible
and<00:05:36.530> also<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.400> exhibition<00:05:37.910> changes

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
and also the exhibition changes

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.200 
and also the exhibition changes
throughout<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:39.350> run<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:40.460> we'll<00:05:40.640> rehang<00:05:41.180> the

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
throughout the run so we'll rehang the

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.660 
throughout the run so we'll rehang the
exhibition<00:05:41.680> so<00:05:42.680> people<00:05:43.010> who<00:05:43.100> do<00:05:43.280> have<00:05:43.310> that

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
exhibition so people who do have that

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.060 
exhibition so people who do have that
depth<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.000> interest<00:05:44.780> will<00:05:44.960> come<00:05:45.170> back<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.650> see

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
depth of interest will come back and see

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.710 
depth of interest will come back and see
the<00:05:46.220> space<00:05:46.430> looking<00:05:46.790> different<00:05:47.270> in<00:05:47.480> a<00:05:47.540> few

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
the space looking different in a few

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.170 
the space looking different in a few
weeks<00:05:47.870> time
