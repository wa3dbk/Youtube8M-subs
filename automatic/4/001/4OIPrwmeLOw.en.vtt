and you just made a video like this for

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.339 
and you just made a video like this for
the<00:00:07.980> iPhone<00:00:08.400> 5s<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.059> if<00:00:09.630> there's<00:00:09.929> people<00:00:10.139> that

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
the iPhone 5s but if there's people that

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.780 
the iPhone 5s but if there's people that
specifically<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:11.130> searching<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.700> the

that one
well<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.379> basically

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
well then I can do it so it's basically

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.349 
well then I can do it so it's basically
the<00:00:16.890> same<00:00:17.070> little<00:00:17.400> thing<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.850> even<00:00:18.270> though

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the same little thing here even though

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.380 
the same little thing here even though
it<00:00:18.480> has<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> plastic<00:00:18.869> body<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:20.490> need<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.850> tool

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it has a plastic body you need a tool

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
it has a plastic body you need a tool
like<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.660> usually<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> from

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
like this usually you will get it from

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.170 
like this usually you will get it from
my<00:00:23.880> experience<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> Box<00:00:25.820> in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> Box

my experience when in the Box in the Box
where<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.109> iPhone<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.550> look

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
where you got the iPhone and so look

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.200 
where you got the iPhone and so look
around<00:00:30.890> for<00:00:31.890> after<00:00:32.219> tool<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.820> because

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
around for after tool like this because

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
around for after tool like this because
you<00:00:33.329> need<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.780> stick<00:00:34.440> something<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you need to stick something into that

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
you need to stick something into that
one<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.660> area<00:00:36.989> over<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
one to that little area over here you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.920 
one to that little area over here you
need<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> stick<00:00:37.829> something<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.930> push

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
need to stick something in here and push

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
need to stick something in here and push
hard<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> click<00:00:41.910> glue<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.780> should

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
hard we just do a click glue you should

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
hard we just do a click glue you should
hear<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> click<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.940> phone

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hear a click this phone

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
hear a click this phone
of<00:00:45.570> course<00:00:45.899> Java<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.800> plastic<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
of course Java is in plastic so you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.240 
of course Java is in plastic so you
don't<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.059> super<00:00:48.840> careful<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
don't have to be super careful but you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.170 
don't have to be super careful but you
can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
can see here take it out like that you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.790 
can see here take it out like that you
can<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.420> I've<00:00:54.539> already<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> SIM<00:00:55.440> card<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
can see I've already have a SIM card in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
can see I've already have a SIM card in
here<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> first<00:00:57.510> time

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
here but if you do it for the first time

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
here but if you do it for the first time
of<00:00:58.289> course<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.129> need<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.489> put<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.539> SIM

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of course you need to put in your SIM

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
of course you need to put in your SIM
card<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.850> now<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> doesn't<00:01:03.210> fit

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
card into this one now if it doesn't fit

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
card into this one now if it doesn't fit
that<00:01:03.809> means<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> find<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.280> SIM

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that means that you need to find a SIM

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.450 
that means that you need to find a SIM
cover<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.780> cut<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> cord<00:01:07.530> yourself<00:01:07.950> yet<00:01:08.189> yes

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
cover or cut the cord yourself yet yes

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 
cover or cut the cord yourself yet yes
you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:08.970> cut<00:01:09.540> bigger<00:01:10.200> SIM<00:01:10.860> cards

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you can actually cut bigger SIM cards

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.789 
you can actually cut bigger SIM cards
into<00:01:11.460> smaller<00:01:11.939> SIM<00:01:12.330> cards<00:01:12.720> either<00:01:13.200> by<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
into smaller SIM cards either by using a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.810 
into smaller SIM cards either by using a
scissor<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.400> using<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> friend<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:16.280> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.520> use

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
scissor or using a friend or if you use

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840 
scissor or using a friend or if you use
the<00:01:18.030> new<00:01:18.689> guy<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:18.960> maybe<00:01:19.650> she<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the new guy this maybe she is go to your

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
the new guy this maybe she is go to your
carrier<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:22.140> help<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> see

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
carrier and get help with it you can see

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.289 
carrier and get help with it you can see
I<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.900> myself<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:27.119> did

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I have cut this one myself and I did

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.840 
I have cut this one myself and I did
actually<00:01:27.479> cut<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> top<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
actually cut here on the top on this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.020 
actually cut here on the top on this
card<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.509> sure<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.560> or

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
card I'm not sure if you can do that or

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
card I'm not sure if you can do that or
but<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.780> work<00:01:34.049> does<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.009> me<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> maybe

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
but does work does work for me and maybe

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.740 
but does work does work for me and maybe
I'll<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.150> lucky<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.479> want

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I'll just lucky but then you just want

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.940 
I'll just lucky but then you just want
to<00:01:39.810> align<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> sides<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
to align it and on one of the sides and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
to align it and on one of the sides and
one<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> sides<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.299> bit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
one of the sides here is a little bit

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
one of the sides here is a little bit
different<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> cut<00:01:46.950> on

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
different because you have to cut on

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.770 
different because you have to cut on
side<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:50.299> additionally<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.600> see

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
side like this additionally you will see

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
side like this additionally you will see
that<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.649> SIM<00:01:52.829> card<00:01:52.860> already<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.329> have

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that on the SIM card already if you have

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
that on the SIM card already if you have
a<00:01:54.479> bigger<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.649> cut<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
a bigger one then you can just cut it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520 
a bigger one then you can just cut it
down<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.520> its<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.360> compact<00:01:57.869> version<00:01:57.930> until

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
down into its more compact version until

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190 
down into its more compact version until
it<00:01:58.799> finally<00:01:59.100> fits<00:01:59.579> or<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.570> by<00:02:00.719> SIM<00:02:00.930> card

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it finally fits or just by SIM card

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
it finally fits or just by SIM card
cutter<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.280> carrier<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.880> if

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
cutter or just go to your carrier but if

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
cutter or just go to your carrier but if
you<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> quick<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you want to do it quick go for it and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
you want to do it quick go for it and
print<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.610> instructions<00:02:05.939> online<00:02:06.350> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
print out instructions online because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.340 
print out instructions online because
they<00:02:07.469> are<00:02:07.530> different<00:02:07.849> sizes<00:02:08.869> and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
they are different sizes and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.000 
they are different sizes and
the<00:02:10.850> Apple<00:02:11.850> used<00:02:12.120> different<00:02:12.840> specific<00:02:13.830> size

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the Apple used different specific size

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.970 
the Apple used different specific size
of<00:02:14.280> SIM<00:02:14.760> card<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.870> think<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.260> either<00:02:16.710> it's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
of SIM card and I think it's either it's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.710 
of SIM card and I think it's either it's
nano<00:02:17.520> SIM<00:02:18.000> card

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
nano SIM card

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.450 
nano SIM card
I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.200> nano<00:02:19.530> SIM<00:02:19.800> card<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.280> then

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
I think it's nano SIM card but then

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.270 
I think it's nano SIM card but then
there's<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.290> micro<00:02:22.290> SIM<00:02:22.500> card<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.010> think

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
there's also like micro SIM card I think

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.010 
there's also like micro SIM card I think
could<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.580> marketing<00:02:24.000> card<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.630> use<00:02:24.780> but

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
could be marketing card that we use but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.840 
could be marketing card that we use but
then<00:02:25.170> there's<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.590> nano<00:02:25.830> SIM<00:02:26.070> card<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.460> I'm

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
then there's like nano SIM card but I'm

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.760 
then there's like nano SIM card but I'm
not<00:02:26.970> sure<00:02:27.150> which<00:02:27.330> one<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.540> there's<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
not sure which one but there's one of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.180 
not sure which one but there's one of
them<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.070> they're<00:02:29.220> using<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.800> stick<00:02:32.100> it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
them that they're using so you stick it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.160 
them that they're using so you stick it
in<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:36.210> now<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.810> going

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
in there and you can see now it's going

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.930 
in there and you can see now it's going
up<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.740> don't<00:02:38.010> want<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.550> happen<00:02:38.580> so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
up so you don't want that to happen so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.890 
up so you don't want that to happen so
then<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.960> be<00:02:40.530> careful<00:02:40.980> relax<00:02:41.730> take<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.750> out

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
then you be careful relax take it out

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.060 
then you be careful relax take it out
align<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> properly<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:46.040> make<00:02:47.040> sure

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
align it properly and then make sure

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.350 
align it properly and then make sure
that<00:02:47.250> nothing<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.940> sticking<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:50.360> then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
that nothing is sticking out and then

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.030 
that nothing is sticking out and then
you<00:02:51.990> just<00:02:52.020> want<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> be<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> little<00:02:52.680> bit<00:02:52.860> careful

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you just want to be a little bit careful

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.950 
you just want to be a little bit careful
here<00:02:53.510> push<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.020> hear<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.010> click<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
here push it in and hear that click and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.350 
here push it in and hear that click and
bam<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.320> should<00:02:58.710> be<00:02:58.830> ready<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.130> go<00:02:59.250> if<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.240> get

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
bam you should be ready to go if you get

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.150 
bam you should be ready to go if you get
an<00:03:00.450> education<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:00.990> no<00:03:01.380> SIM<00:03:01.590> card<00:03:01.860> install

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
an education here no SIM card install

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.760 
an education here no SIM card install
but<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.240> get<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> pop<00:03:03.690> up<00:03:03.900> over<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.440> now<00:03:08.390> if

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
but you get a pop up over here now if

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
but you get a pop up over here now if
you<00:03:10.770> did<00:03:10.980> align<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.610> correctly<00:03:12.000> if<00:03:12.210> if<00:03:12.360> nothing

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
you did align it correctly if if nothing

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.740 
you did align it correctly if if nothing
happens<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.280> no<00:03:14.520> sim<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.120> text

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
happens if you see that no sim is text

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.200 
happens if you see that no sim is text
then<00:03:16.380> obviously<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.400> did<00:03:17.580> something<00:03:17.850> wrong

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
then obviously you did something wrong

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.840 
then obviously you did something wrong
and<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:21.480> could<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:23.340> aligned

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and it could be that you do have aligned

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:32.800 
and it could be that you do have aligned
it<00:03:24.680> correctly<00:03:25.680> wrong<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:31.350> let's<00:03:31.560> try<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:31.860> one

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it correctly wrong so let's try this one

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:46.990 
it correctly wrong so let's try this one
now<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.840> did<00:03:34.110> line<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.530> align<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.460> another<00:03:35.820> way

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.770 

and<00:03:47.420> bam<00:03:47.780> now<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.800> did<00:03:49.040> work<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.120> make<00:03:50.510> sure<00:03:50.540> you

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
and bam now it did work so make sure you

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.960 
and bam now it did work so make sure you
cut<00:03:50.960> it<00:03:51.110> correctly<00:03:51.620> because<00:03:52.280> there's<00:03:52.640> very

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
cut it correctly because there's very

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.200 
cut it correctly because there's very
very<00:03:53.030> easy<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.510> make<00:03:53.630> mistakes<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
very easy to make mistakes and if you

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.540 
very easy to make mistakes and if you
don't<00:03:56.390> find<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.660> tool<00:03:56.840> like<00:03:56.990> this<00:03:57.230> go<00:03:58.070> look<00:03:58.280> in

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
don't find a tool like this go look in

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.870 
don't find a tool like this go look in
your<00:03:58.580> Apple<00:03:59.420> box<00:03:59.660> one<00:04:00.170> more<00:04:00.440> time<00:04:00.710> they<00:04:01.550> could

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
your Apple box one more time they could

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.540 
your Apple box one more time they could
be<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:02.150> little<00:04:02.510> bit<00:04:02.600> hard<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.260> find<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:04.430> then

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
be a little bit hard to find but then

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.090 
be a little bit hard to find but then
you<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.790> also<00:04:04.910> use<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:05.180> keys<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.650> need

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
you can also use like keys and you need

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.130 
you can also use like keys and you need
to<00:04:07.220> find<00:04:07.400> something<00:04:07.730> that's<00:04:07.910> very<00:04:08.390> small<00:04:08.840> they

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
to find something that's very small they

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.640 
to find something that's very small they
can<00:04:09.380> stick<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:10.070> jam<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.640> there<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.960> have

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
can stick and jam it in there and have
