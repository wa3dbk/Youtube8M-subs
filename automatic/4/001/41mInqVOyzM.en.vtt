elegant lines big structure but here is
different<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> wish<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> make

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
different I think if you wish to make

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.470 
different I think if you wish to make
something<00:02:02.389> really<00:02:03.389> great

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
something really great

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.920 
something really great
for<00:02:04.660> us<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.350> more<00:02:05.560> than<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.980> it<00:02:06.940> mean<00:02:07.180> did

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
for us but more than this it mean did

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.110 
for us but more than this it mean did
you<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:09.300> think<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.900> try<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.560> work<00:02:11.920> at<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you have to think to try to work at the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140 
you have to think to try to work at the
same<00:02:13.360> way<00:02:13.540> as<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> nature<00:02:14.380> work<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.790> he<00:02:15.940> looked

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
same way as the nature work so he looked

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.650 
same way as the nature work so he looked
forest<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.470> example<00:02:17.820> forest<00:02:18.820> is<00:02:19.000> never<00:02:19.240> just

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
forest for example forest is never just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.070 
forest for example forest is never just
occasional<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.890> oak<00:02:21.190> always<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.510> serious<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
occasional just oak always is serious a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.340 
occasional just oak always is serious a
thousand<00:02:23.740> different<00:02:23.860> events<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> same<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
thousand different events so the same is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.910 
thousand different events so the same is
here<00:02:26.740> with<00:02:27.010> sorry<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.750> way<00:02:28.990> we<00:02:29.500> could<00:02:29.650> come

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
here with sorry this way we could come

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.490 
here with sorry this way we could come
closer<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.270> nature<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:32.110> every

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
closer to the nature because every

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.950 
closer to the nature because every
variety<00:02:32.910> reproduced<00:02:33.910> some<00:02:34.180> elements<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
variety reproduced some elements and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.590 
variety reproduced some elements and
some<00:02:35.440> other<00:02:35.590> elements<00:02:36.160> take<00:02:36.400> out<00:02:36.640> from<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
some other elements take out from the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.020 
some other elements take out from the
soil<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.560> because<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.520> seven<00:02:39.910> different

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
soil so because of seven different

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.660 
soil so because of seven different
varieties<00:02:40.750> every<00:02:41.170> variety<00:02:41.290> take<00:02:42.070> out<00:02:42.340> some

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
varieties every variety take out some

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.020 
varieties every variety take out some
elements<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.450> reproduce<00:02:43.870> other<00:02:44.800> elements<00:02:45.550> so

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
elements and reproduce other elements so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.780 
elements and reproduce other elements so
always<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:47.230> everything<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.220> soil

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
always is everything in this soil

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.830 
always is everything in this soil
so<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.870> don't<00:02:50.080> need<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:51.190> winemaker<00:02:51.970> who

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
so this don't need the winemaker who

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.350 
so this don't need the winemaker who
every<00:02:53.200> year<00:02:54.010> or<00:02:54.130> every<00:02:54.310> second<00:02:54.850> year<00:02:54.970> have

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
every year or every second year have

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.490 
every year or every second year have
some<00:02:56.010> fertilizers<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.280> growing<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:58.510> it's

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
some fertilizers for growing but it's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.210 
some fertilizers for growing but it's
like<00:02:59.740> nature<00:03:00.250> could<00:03:00.610> give<00:03:00.840> thousand<00:03:01.840> years

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
like nature could give thousand years

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:11.910 
like nature could give thousand years
from<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:03.430> seed<00:03:07.680> once<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:10.050> whole<00:03:11.050> story<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
from one seed once it is whole story of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.490 
from one seed once it is whole story of
many<00:03:12.520> million<00:03:12.880> years<00:03:12.910> before<00:03:13.480> come<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.110> deceit

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
many million years before come to deceit

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.460 
many million years before come to deceit
and<00:03:14.770> if<00:03:15.459> we<00:03:15.580> give<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.970> chance<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.930> give<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
and if we give the chance to give to the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.449 
and if we give the chance to give to the
soil<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:18.760> deliver<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.240> water<00:03:19.560> its<00:03:20.560> story<00:03:20.980> for

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
soil to deliver the water its story for

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.970 
soil to deliver the water its story for
the<00:03:21.580> next<00:03:21.900> millions<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.140> years<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.730> one<00:03:25.030> seat

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the next millions of years just one seat

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.920 
the next millions of years just one seat
so<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.310> think<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.030> nature<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.720> most

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
so I think the nature is the most

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.400 
so I think the nature is the most
perfect<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:31.450> each<00:03:31.720> variety<00:03:31.959> have

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
perfect because each variety have

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.040 
perfect because each variety have
different<00:03:32.800> between<00:03:33.070> time<00:03:33.580> with<00:03:34.120> our<00:03:34.360> Caesarea

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
different between time with our Caesarea

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.590 
different between time with our Caesarea
