00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.079
 an agent with his experience and I suggest 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.289
 the turn 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.840
 the service is not 100 percent but I it is not sure 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 and that makes a little 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 it just needs to quickly find out which song 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.770
 again this year it is really impossible to say 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.990
 if you perse 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.820
 the Turks no 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.739

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 that a group and yes it will be a nice gain 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.550
 hp 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 very easy 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.880

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.369
 the keeper 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.680
 eventually I kept growing 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.239
 purpose of the campaign 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.400
 but tackle it 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.199
 b 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.689
 this causes surgical points 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.039
 9 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.650

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:46.969
 Good idea 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.229
 a shame and with a lot of noise that is a decrease in the number of Rafael van der 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.229
 hendrik had 85 countries 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:58.210

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.430
 in 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.120
 this number three 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.120

 if he did not want to tell 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.990
 it is still unknown field I cannot look at it 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.430
 which can 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.460

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.860

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.009
 the match with a 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.260
 I am really worthy there 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.290
 do you know about teachers from a few 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.910
 from measurements of the pvv not really not the only thing I eat 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.129
 I did last year with last year yes all that wrong moment that the 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.129
 characters with pain in the neck 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.059
 match if you maybe eat a little 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.789
 four points to get the draw for the EC 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:50.419
 companies look
