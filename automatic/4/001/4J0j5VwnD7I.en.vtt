so that for the government receiving its
own<00:01:40.200> IO<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.810> getting<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> piece

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
own IO use is just like getting a piece

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.499 
own IO use is just like getting a piece
of<00:01:43.979> paper<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
government so the government would never

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
make no sense whatsoever it be even

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.050 
make no sense whatsoever it be even
sillier<00:01:51.960> than<00:01:52.619> collecting<00:01:53.220> its<00:01:53.369> IOU<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.880> in

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
sillier than collecting its IOU use in

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
sillier than collecting its IOU use in

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
one who wants the reserves so the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.930 
one who wants the reserves so the
central<00:04:07.810> bank<00:04:08.020> will<00:04:08.260> have<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.620> be<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.460> who

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
central bank will have to be the one who

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.050 
central bank will have to be the one who
offers<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.510> take<00:04:10.720> them<00:04:11.070> ok<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.280> that's<00:04:12.820> how

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
offers to take them ok and that's how

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.180 
offers to take them ok and that's how
the<00:04:13.150> central<00:04:13.540> bank<00:04:13.780> keeps<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.620> interest<00:04:14.980> rate

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the central bank keeps the interest rate

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.000 
the central bank keeps the interest rate
from<00:04:15.490> going<00:04:15.760> below<00:04:16.120> its<00:04:16.269> target<00:04:16.690> rate<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.830> if

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
from going below its target rate so if

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.620 
from going below its target rate so if
the<00:04:18.190> central<00:04:18.549> bank's<00:04:18.760> target<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.270> let's<00:04:19.540> just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
the central bank's target is let's just

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.340 
the central bank's target is let's just
say<00:04:19.989> for<00:04:20.049> example<00:04:20.350> 3<00:04:21.040> percent<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.640> then<00:04:22.600> it's

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
say for example 3 percent of then it's

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.340 
say for example 3 percent of then it's
got<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.680> drain<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.400> extra<00:04:24.730> reserves<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:26.140> keep

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
got to drain the extra reserves to keep

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.990 
got to drain the extra reserves to keep
the<00:04:26.560> rate<00:04:26.710> from<00:04:26.920> falling<00:04:27.370> below<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.640> 3

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
the rate from falling below the 3

the rate from falling below the 3
percent<00:04:28.210> target<00:04:28.800> how<00:04:29.800> does<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.310> take<00:04:31.180> those

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
percent target how does it take those

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.500 
percent target how does it take those
reserves<00:04:31.840> back<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:32.590> sells<00:04:32.950> bonds<00:04:33.360> that's<00:04:34.360> how

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
reserves back it sells bonds that's how

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.890 
reserves back it sells bonds that's how
it<00:04:34.660> does<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.140> sells<00:04:35.460> Treasury<00:04:36.460> bonds<00:04:37.150> to

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
it does it it sells Treasury bonds to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.310 
it does it it sells Treasury bonds to
take<00:04:38.140> back<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.860> extra<00:04:38.980> reserves<00:04:39.600> now<00:04:40.600> if<00:04:40.900> you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
take back the extra reserves now if you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.950 
take back the extra reserves now if you
have<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.920> government<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.870> over<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
have a government that is over the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.080 
have a government that is over the
course<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.440> year

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
course of the year

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.120 
course of the year
continuous<00:04:46.170> crediting<00:04:47.170> more<00:04:47.440> accounts<00:04:48.070> than

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
continuous crediting more accounts than

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.050 
continuous crediting more accounts than
in<00:04:48.490> debits<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.870> we<00:04:50.020> call<00:04:50.260> that<00:04:51.010> is<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> budget

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
in debits what we call that is a budget

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.830 
in debits what we call that is a budget
deficit<00:04:52.560> because<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.710> means<00:04:53.920> that<00:04:54.160> they<00:04:54.490> are

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
deficit because it means that they are

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.470 
deficit because it means that they are
spending<00:04:55.840> more<00:04:56.140> than<00:04:56.560> they<00:04:57.490> receive<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.000> taxes

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
spending more than they receive in taxes

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.659 
spending more than they receive in taxes
so<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.200> crediting<00:04:59.680> more<00:04:59.860> counts<00:05:00.250> in<00:05:00.370> endeavor

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
so the crediting more counts in endeavor

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.210 
so the crediting more counts in endeavor
they're<00:05:01.150> continually<00:05:01.720> creating<00:05:02.410> more

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
they're continually creating more

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.270 
they're continually creating more
reserves<00:05:03.640> on<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.540> continuous<00:05:05.110> basis<00:05:05.590> those

reserves on a continuous basis those

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.850 
reserves on a continuous basis those
have<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.490> be<00:05:06.640> drained<00:05:07.140> by<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.200> central<00:05:08.650> bank

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.780 
have to be drained by the central bank
the<00:05:09.790> central<00:05:10.180> bank<00:05:10.390> has<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.230> limited<00:05:11.950> supply<00:05:12.220> of

trillion or so this is by many orders of

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.060 
trillion or so this is by many orders of
magnitude<00:05:33.070> bigger<00:05:33.960> than<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.650> feds<00:05:37.500> stock<00:05:38.500> of

any<00:05:46.430> more<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:47.300> guys<00:05:47.539> have<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.960> start<00:05:48.169> selling

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
any more you guys have to start selling
