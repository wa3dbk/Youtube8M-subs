flash<00:01:29.689> lights<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:31.290> puts<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> through<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
flash lights which puts it through a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.870 
flash lights which puts it through a
flash<00:01:32.579> mode<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.380> leave<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.530> strobe<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.460> is

flash mode I leave that strobe which is
a<00:01:35.909> slightly<00:01:36.420> slower<00:01:37.280> flash<00:01:39.350> beats<00:01:40.350> every<00:01:40.740> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a slightly slower flash beats every so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.440 
a slightly slower flash beats every so
often<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> you've<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.110> fade<00:01:44.030> which<00:01:45.030> fades

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
often and you've got fade which fades

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.530 
often and you've got fade which fades
through<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> different<00:01:46.229> colors<00:01:47.360> then<00:01:48.360> you've

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
through the different colors then you've

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
through the different colors then you've
got<00:01:48.689> strobe<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.920> does<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> same<00:01:50.520> thing<00:01:50.759> but

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
got strobe which does the same thing but

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.560 
got strobe which does the same thing but
slower<00:01:51.509> again<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:53.220> you've<00:01:53.340> got<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:54.240> major

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
slower again and you've got three major

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.319 
slower again and you've got three major
colors<00:01:54.990> red<00:01:55.320> green<00:01:55.409> blue<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.939> different

colors red green blue and then different

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.690 
colors red green blue and then different
variations<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.200> each<00:01:59.000> red<00:02:00.000> Oh<00:02:01.219> too<00:02:02.219> much<00:02:02.399> off

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
variations of each red Oh too much off

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.929 
variations of each red Oh too much off
and<00:02:02.880> I'll<00:02:03.000> show<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.009> it's<00:02:05.009> pretty<00:02:05.250> directional

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and I'll show it it's pretty directional

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.410 
and I'll show it it's pretty directional
most<00:02:06.710> lamps<00:02:07.710> incandescent<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> CFL
