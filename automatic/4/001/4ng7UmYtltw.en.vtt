00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 dirty stage of licenses carry the east 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.400
 this week i'm going to talk to you a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.710
 little bit of bodybuilding exercises 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269
 that I am doing as part of my 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.070
 physical preparation sometimes the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.590
 bodybuilding scares some people 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.109
 practicing combat sports because 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.750
 that they have the prehension does the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 deserved to be a little less 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 fluid at the level of the movements then 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 that a good bodybuilding practice is going 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 not generate these effects there on the contrary 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 with good bodybuilding practice 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 can increase its explosiveness and so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 the effective ones during the fights for that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 I practice four basic exercises at 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.570
 level of bodybuilding 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 the first basic exercise is the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 bench press so the developed 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 lying on the bench with bar this job 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.090
 bench press can win at 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.300
 level of brakes ladies in boxing 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 we are more powerful second exercise 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 that I practice regularly these are 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 Tractions Tractions are 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 interesting because it allows 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.790
 reinforce throwing a back and especially 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 the guard fixers it costs less 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.409
 of energy to be in range when one has 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.909
 two powerful and very pulling is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 interesting since it allows working 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.190
 the entire back in this locality 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.720
 when you have the level in traction 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.920
 do not hesitate to leave your action 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.500
 adding weights of 5 to 10 or even 20 kg 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.760
 so as to always have a job 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.240
 in strength 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.910
 third exercise the cladding so the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 household extremely important since 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.800
 sheathing helps strengthen the transfer 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.280
 this transfer what is the goal most 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.150
 deep of the abdominal strap is so 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.550
 order of the strikes 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.710
 we are better protected sata least seen 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.590
 that she is also we have a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.070
 better posture there is no 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.690
 that waller dodging even static one 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 is much more stable 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.780
 then another exercise we will say 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.560
 traditional and unavoidable squats 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.840
 so the squat helps to strengthen 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.920
 the whole already concentrates that the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.740
 glutes the gray hairs too and this 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.310
 movement if it's here it's tomorrow 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.530
 technique is not painful mans 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.800
 for the back it is necessary to reassure 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.960
 finally a traditional exercise too 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 raise the subject of soul that vettel 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.160
 allows us to strengthen 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.140
 spy on new green version 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.600
 nominal is an exercise extremely 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.180
 complete but requires first a 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.150
 good technique for that really plays at 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.880
 work with a mirror in front of you and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.590
 also a mirror his side does it first 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.960
 a person who can reframe you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.500
 level of movement it's still 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.080
 the most ultimate thing also work 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.060
 complementary to 10 cities here pump 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.380
 is always beneficial non frames of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.360
 your practice when one is 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.030
 practicing combat sports in 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.730
 general our goal is to take 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.550
 weight since we are forced by the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.390
 category then in this case there 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.400
 serial repeat and their skin and 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.140
 past tablets when I 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.770
 are working on exercises of 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.810
 bodybuilding 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.060
 I always do less here 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.890
 repetition which allows to work 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.020
 the measurement of heavy loads 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.840
 and in that sense hyper trophy without taking 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.730
 of muscle mass the pond robots are 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.870
 relatively to come and get her back 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.750
 totally that in general play it 4 4 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.540
 about minutes and I work in 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.440
 general over three to four exercises 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.970
 which makes a total of three sessions 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.920
 about 15 sets more or less than six 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.170
 repetition it is always possible to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.030
 work on two exercises of 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.160
 bodybuilding to strengthen for example 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.330
 part of the body while a weak 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.550
 however I always advise to do 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.770
 joint pony exercises that 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.010
 leads to muscle rejection in addition to it 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.980
 for example I do not have a lot of clubs 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.940
 picenze few hours septe bah it 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.989
 allows to work biceps but 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.420
 I do not think it's extremely 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.190
 important in a practice 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.170
 of fighting seconds I say to myself 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.500
 rather articular polite exercises 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.760
 except his phalanx by the brusquois the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.280
 squat which is interesting it's very 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.260
 ugly several muscle chains between 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.410
 they and so that allows to have 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.570
 effectiveness after on the movements by 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.910
 year between the cost of this phase I 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.890
 much more effective then the good 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.600
 practice of bodybuilding helps to 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.080
 gain strength as a result of the wish of the 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.210
 So why hump practiced 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.930
 exercises with a load almost 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.270
 maximum 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.000
 I advise to be above 80 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.950
 % if you are able to put 100 kg 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.650
 at the bench press for example you 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.080
 do not work at less than 81 kg when that 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.760
 really lets work on your 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.350
 strength 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.860
 theoretically at the end of your your 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.750
 exercise 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.670
 you are not able to do 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.540
 repetitions if you are able to 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.370
 to do rehearsals 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.280
 it's just that you have to charge 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.840
 the cost of over the bar and when 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.030
 so we were entitled below 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.470
 seats is what we look for when you 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.170
 are in a gym 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.190
 do not necessarily try to do the 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.390
 same exercises wearing bodybuilder car 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.920
 since it's purpose will serve a 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.520
 muscular hypertrophy no side 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.200
 aesthetic and not necessarily efficiency 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.420
 in development he is much more 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.120
 interesting to create his program in 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.129
 oneself on gentle exercises and 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.959
 effective then in the frame 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.179
 political practice in 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:51.239
 training frequency when I'm 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:52.379
 over three months of a doorman deadline 

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:55.619
 so that is at the beginning of the year 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:59.189
 only happy age tourism four 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:00.839
 bodybuilding sessions a week because 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.119
 that ben jerry time then to recover 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:05.610
 there is no problem 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:07.080
 then the deadline is closer 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.969
 game reduces the number of sessions in 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.499
 competition period I hold everything 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.929
 of the same second training of 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:14.929
 bodybuilding on heavy week 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.939
