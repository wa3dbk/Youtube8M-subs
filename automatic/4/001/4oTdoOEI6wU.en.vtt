00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.200
 today we are going to talk about organization and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.910
 a way for you to overcome anxiety 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.070
 because society is a serious problem 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.369
 Anxiety is something that legs and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.380
 catch you take everyone and the world where 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.580
 we live is the world full of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
 collection right 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.539
 It seems like every day we have more 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.599
 thing to do and who lives in a city 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.760
 How are Paul then in the city a moon? 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.600
 full of appointments full of rallies 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.540
 full of claims and traffic 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.120
 we get bored with them and then the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.489
 I suggest you to be a little 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 a few minutes of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.090
 silence 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 everybody can stay home meditating 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 five minutes right 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.469
 this is possible everyone can hear a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 mantra to leave that heavier energy 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.050
 though because this also works 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.649
 also helps, but in relation to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.629
 anxiety that I suggest you remember 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.189
 from that time everyone had a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 paper agenda 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.390
 we have our agendas today 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.270
 electronics tell us that we 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 Tell us the notepad to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 People today have the time to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 people have our calendar is one million 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.439
 of things, and every time we have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.790
 anything for this has anything 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.860
 more 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 so let's go back a little at the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.119
 time 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.210
 let's take a right at home or notepad 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.670
 in your office in your company and you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 notes there some things that are 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 important to note on paper because doing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 the paper annotation 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.909
 so it gives you more control over the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.130
 Things you notice, he has to call. 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 My mother super ox commitment call 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 for the mother but there is a commitment 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 You have to talk to your mother in that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 Day if you have to talk, look, only mother. 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.400
 took that medicine is better 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.980
 it's a kindness, a kindness, but 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.660
 names that sometimes in the wave of the day everything 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.170
 What are we going to do to people? 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.440
 forget and it does not work there, and then we 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.840
 sadness 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.820
 and we get anxious sometimes 11 hours 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.250
 night and remembers if he had to 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.090
 connected to your mother, I'm not going 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.670
 to sleep 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.810
 he spent the day and commitment upon 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.290
 of commitments 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 So do it, I suggest you take your 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.060
 notebook and the new notepad 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.060
 things that are important to you 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.790
 to do and then you do to those 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.930
 obligations and if by chance they are 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.730
 emotional 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.830
 So let's see if there are some things. 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.530
 which has everything we both had some 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.630
 thoughts and you know you need 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.150
 solve and there to fight the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.540
 write on paper 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.850
 write it all try to organize and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.800
 try to do because sometimes in that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.450
 Your commitment if you had to talk to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.420
 someone had to look for something 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.790
 sad that looking for a document had to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.370
 be talking to your dispatcher to solve 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.830
 some pipino something that is not cool 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.060
 put it there after it has been solved and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.280
 burn delivery of the masters of the caru 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.160
 thank you have your chores meet the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.739
 thankfully because nothing 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.100
 better than the sense of duty 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.880
 I did everything good to have you more 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.880
 per week
