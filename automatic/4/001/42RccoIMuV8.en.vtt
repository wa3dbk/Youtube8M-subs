00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409
 stays dry throughout the day 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 sunny sections and in the sunny 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.820
 then it goes over the middle sections 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.329
 and the south up to 18 to 20 degrees 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.060

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.790
 16 degrees the wind mostly weak he turns 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 counterclockwise and such a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.630
 deep axis over the middle 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.820
 or the north is the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.890
 next day just like him 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.350
 see the south still quite cloudy the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.330
 especially for friday then over 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.550
 the middle and the south of saturday only 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.100
 in the extreme south and there it is 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.080
 there also only highest temperatures around 9 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.480
 Grad goes up next week again 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.980

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 Monday at least easier 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.370
 Temperature rise is so then 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.880
