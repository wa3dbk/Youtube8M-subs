00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
driving all night BC I'm stacking them

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.250 
driving all night BC I'm stacking them
in<00:00:55.420> piles<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.899> four<00:00:59.070> four<00:01:00.070> high<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.609> is<00:01:01.260> just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
in piles of four four high that is just

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.640 
in piles of four four high that is just
use<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.890> load<00:01:03.070> up

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:20.219 

without<00:01:09.040> next<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.850> other<00:01:10.060> one

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.859 

see<00:01:20.890> if<00:01:20.979> i<00:01:21.070> zoom<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.549> I'll<00:01:21.789> just<00:01:22.149> release<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
see if i zoom in I'll just release the

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.560 
see if i zoom in I'll just release the
clothes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.350 

so<00:01:32.110> essentially<00:01:32.950> all<00:01:33.160> I'm<00:01:33.280> doing<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.730> I'm<00:01:34.120> just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
so essentially all I'm doing is I'm just

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.680 
so essentially all I'm doing is I'm just
protecting<00:01:34.840> my<00:01:34.990> asset<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:36.310> fact<00:01:36.670> there<00:01:36.850> I'm

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.880 
protecting my asset in fact there I'm
not<00:01:37.870> where<00:01:37.960> they<00:01:38.020> get<00:01:38.140> all<00:01:38.290> these<00:01:38.410> loads<00:01:38.650> on<00:01:38.860> a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
not where they get all these loads on a

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.420 
not where they get all these loads on a
trailer<00:01:39.310> tonight<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.980> won't<00:01:42.160> do<00:01:42.250> any<00:01:42.400> harm

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
to have them stacked up overnight into

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.900 
to have them stacked up overnight into
piles<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.570> field<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.610> deal<00:01:48.790> with

piles in the field and I can deal with

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.350 
piles in the field and I can deal with
these<00:01:49.000> tomorrow<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.070> let's<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.120> put<00:01:52.330> that
