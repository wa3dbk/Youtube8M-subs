hi<00:00:00.719> YouTube<00:00:01.050> use<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.260> little<00:00:01.560> announcement<00:00:01.770> of

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hi YouTube use a little announcement of

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.150 
hi YouTube use a little announcement of
mind<00:00:02.490> my<00:00:03.480> home<00:00:03.659> page<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:04.020> down<00:00:04.560> right<00:00:04.890> now

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
mind my home page is down right now

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.620 
mind my home page is down right now
since<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.660> server<00:00:06.960> has<00:00:07.290> gone<00:00:07.500> away<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.630> shed

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
since the server has gone away I shed

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.999 
since the server has gone away I shed
the<00:00:10.080> server<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:12.259> friend<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> mine<00:00:13.440> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the server with a friend of mine and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.960 
the server with a friend of mine and
well<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> suppose<00:00:15.360> friend<00:00:16.100> but<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.580> server<00:00:17.850> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
well I suppose friend but the server is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.760 
well I suppose friend but the server is
no<00:00:18.150> longer<00:00:18.359> available<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> me<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> don't

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
no longer available to me so I don't

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.050 
no longer available to me so I don't
have<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> server<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.430> now<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> host<00:00:20.939> my

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
have a server right now to host my

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
have a server right now to host my
homepage<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.810> means<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.350> home<00:00:22.500> pitch<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
homepage which means my home pitch is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.560 
homepage which means my home pitch is
down<00:00:23.000> um<00:00:24.800> yeah<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> wanted<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
down um yeah that's what I wanted to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.959 
down um yeah that's what I wanted to
tell<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> please<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:29.689> ask<00:00:30.689> me<00:00:31.610> about<00:00:32.610> my

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tell you please don't ask me about my

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.580 
tell you please don't ask me about my
homepage<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.079> don't<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:36.260> hi<00:00:37.260> I'm

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
homepage right now I don't know hi I'm

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
homepage right now I don't know hi I'm
in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> process<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.430> looking<00:00:38.610> around<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in the process of looking around for

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
in the process of looking around for
something<00:00:39.660> no<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> host<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> since<00:00:42.350> I'm<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
something no to host on but since I'm a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.100 
something no to host on but since I'm a
little<00:00:43.739> short<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.309> money<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.030> since<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
little short on money right now since I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.950 
little short on money right now since I
lost<00:00:46.260> my<00:00:46.440> job<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:48.210> could<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lost my job and all this could take a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
lost my job and all this could take a
while<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.059> since<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> become<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> video

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
while and since I want to become a video

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.279 
while and since I want to become a video
millionaire<00:00:52.649> um<00:00:53.480> suppose<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.050> on

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
millionaire um suppose I have to go on

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.729 
millionaire um suppose I have to go on
here<00:00:55.730> yeah<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:58.730> have<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.000> few<00:01:00.390> problems<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.140> my

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
here yeah I have a few problems with my

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.390 
here yeah I have a few problems with my
current<00:01:02.039> project<00:01:04.729> especially<00:01:05.729> its<00:01:07.400> well

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
current project especially its well

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
current project especially its well
that's<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.700> problem<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.960> power<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that's one problem it's the power of a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
that's one problem it's the power of a
USB<00:01:10.979> 500<00:01:11.970> milliamps<00:01:12.180> problem<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.360> first<00:01:15.600> one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
USB 500 milliamps problem the first one

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100 
USB 500 milliamps problem the first one
already<00:01:16.020> identified<00:01:17.420> drove<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.869> nuts

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
already identified drove me little nuts

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.710 
already identified drove me little nuts
but<00:01:20.299> identified<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:23.390> had<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> wrong

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but identified it I had the wrong

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.300 
but identified it I had the wrong
transistor<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:30.950> suppose<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
transistor in there suppose I have to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
transistor in there suppose I have to
correct<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.329> circuit<00:01:33.659> diagram<00:01:34.020> as

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
correct it in the circuit diagram as

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.010 
correct it in the circuit diagram as
well<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.400> strong<00:01:35.790> transistor<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.780> don't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
well this was strong transistor I don't

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
well this was strong transistor I don't
know<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> did<00:01:37.740> exactly<00:01:38.130> i'm<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.700> quite

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
know what I did exactly i'm not quite

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.010 
know what I did exactly i'm not quite
sure<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.930> he<00:01:41.299> perverted<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
sure but I think he perverted this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.550 
sure but I think he perverted this
circuit<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.799> idle<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> last<00:01:44.369> time<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> did<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
circuit at idle the last time I did it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880 
circuit at idle the last time I did it
we<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.950> means<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> had<00:01:47.520> help<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.970> circuit

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
we the means I had help with a circuit

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.880 
we the means I had help with a circuit
and<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.399> probably<00:01:50.640> why<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.470> had<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> wrong

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and this is probably why I had the wrong

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
and this is probably why I had the wrong
transistor<00:01:53.610> yeah<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.750> here

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
transistor yeah this little one here

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.060 
transistor yeah this little one here
let's<00:01:55.140> draw<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:58.070> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
let's draw one that I had in here and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
let's draw one that I had in here and
the<00:01:59.250> second<00:01:59.670> problem<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.299> um<00:02:02.689> patina<00:02:03.689> diet

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the second problem is um patina diet

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.609 
the second problem is um patina diet
here<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:06.229> it's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:08.009> exactly<00:02:08.550> suitable

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
here this one it's not exactly suitable

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
here this one it's not exactly suitable
for<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.739> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> configuration<00:02:11.690> getting<00:02:12.690> 5

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

for this kind of configuration getting 5
volts<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.349> getting

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
volts and getting

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
volts and getting
and<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> tots<00:02:14.880> own<00:02:15.150> worlds<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
switch regulator such that it gets out

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.640

three to three worlds on the main power
rail<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:24.860> was<00:02:25.860> afraid<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.150> ruined<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.790> X

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
rail I was afraid that I ruined the X

rail I was afraid that I ruined the X
meager<00:02:30.150> processor<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.190> process<00:02:32.580> but

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
meager processor in the process but

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.550 
meager processor in the process but
thankfully<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.070> didn't<00:02:35.430> happen<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.320> was

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
thankfully this didn't happen so I was

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980 
thankfully this didn't happen so I was
able<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.010> program<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.150> fuse<00:02:39.390> bites<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.870> this

able to program the fuse bites of this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.020 
able to program the fuse bites of this
controller<00:02:40.440> already<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.130> did<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> little<00:02:41.760> smoke

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
controller already so did a little smoke

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
controller already so did a little smoke
test<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:43.040> seems<00:02:44.040> good<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.280> far<00:02:44.690> problem<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.980> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
test here seems good so far problem is I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.590 
test here seems good so far problem is I
have<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.459> rethink<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.000> power<00:02:48.240> part

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
have to rethink the power part

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.890 
have to rethink the power part
especially<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:50.550> five<00:02:50.790> votes<00:02:51.030> from<00:02:51.240> from<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
especially the five votes from from the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.440 
especially the five votes from from the
US<00:02:52.140> beep<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.950> how<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.880> can<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.420> there

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
US beep and how I can get it there

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.610 
US beep and how I can get it there
because<00:02:55.489> problem<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.040> not<00:03:00.620> possible

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
because problem is it is not possible

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
because problem is it is not possible
for<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.280> switch-up<00:03:03.150> regulator<00:03:03.720> which<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
for this switch-up regulator which is a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.940 
for this switch-up regulator which is a
step<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.739> regulator<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:06.720> give<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> more<00:03:07.170> than<00:03:07.230> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
step up regulator to give it more than I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.360 
step up regulator to give it more than I
say<00:03:08.700> three<00:03:09.030> worlds<00:03:09.330> top<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:10.620> probably<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.220> much

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
say three worlds top as probably as much

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
say three worlds top as probably as much
eka<00:03:11.610> guess<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.239> give<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.660> kind<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.260> give

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
eka guess I can give it I kind of give

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.740 
eka guess I can give it I kind of give
it<00:03:13.590> say<00:03:14.450> no<00:03:15.450> 44<00:03:16.140> or<00:03:16.500> whatever<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.630> will

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
it say no 44 or whatever because it will

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.509 
it say no 44 or whatever because it will
let<00:03:18.930> more<00:03:19.880> voltage<00:03:20.880> through<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
let more voltage through then is

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:31.270 
let more voltage through then is
actually<00:03:24.860> good<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:27.810> hope<00:03:28.230> everything

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.449 

survived<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:33.180> little<00:03:33.510> test<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.459> less

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
survived this little test and less

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.670 
survived this little test and less
little<00:03:35.850> that's<00:03:36.209> bad<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.500> rethink

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
little that's bad so I have to rethink

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.520 
little that's bad so I have to rethink
the<00:03:37.980> thing<00:03:38.190> with<00:03:38.549> latina<00:03:39.330> light<00:03:39.530> maybe

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the thing with latina light maybe

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.070 
the thing with latina light maybe
rethink<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.430> circuit<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.940> little<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.900> this

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
rethink the circuit a little in this

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.580 
rethink the circuit a little in this
respect<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.239> power<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.750> thing<00:03:45.810> over

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
respect so I can power this thing over

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.710 
respect so I can power this thing over
USB<00:03:47.250> which<00:03:47.640> was<00:03:49.850> quite<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.060> point<00:03:51.299> for<00:03:51.510> me<00:03:51.600> to

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
USB which was quite of a point for me to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.630 
USB which was quite of a point for me to
power<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.080> thing<00:03:52.140> over<00:03:52.470> USB<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.519> to

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
power this thing over USB so I have to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.120 
power this thing over USB so I have to
rethink<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.209> little<00:03:54.950> usually<00:03:55.950> with

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
rethink this a little usually with

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.880 
rethink this a little usually with
linear<00:03:56.820> regulator<00:03:57.660> which<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.170> use<00:03:58.410> normally

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
linear regulator which I use normally

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.560 
linear regulator which I use normally
this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.370> not<00:03:59.640> not<00:03:59.970> much<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.360> problem

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
this is not not much of a problem

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.390 
this is not not much of a problem
because<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.110> drops<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.980> additional

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
because it drops in the additional

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.729 
because it drops in the additional
voltage<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> step<00:04:04.200> or<00:04:04.350> break<00:04:04.590> you

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
voltage but this is a step or break you

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.880 
voltage but this is a step or break you
later<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:06.450> doesn't<00:04:06.510> do<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.680> have

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
later and it doesn't do that so I have

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.630 
later and it doesn't do that so I have
to<00:04:08.010> rethink<00:04:08.190> about<00:04:08.700> what<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> can<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.640> yeah

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
to rethink about what I can do here yeah

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.229 
to rethink about what I can do here yeah
and<00:04:12.120> since<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.810> figured<00:04:13.110> this<00:04:13.230> out<00:04:13.910> until<00:04:14.910> I

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
and since I figured this out until I

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.390 
and since I figured this out until I
figure<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.600> out<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:16.079> suppose<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.769> have<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:18.229> yeah

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
figure this out I suppose I have to yeah

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.630 
figure this out I suppose I have to yeah
we<00:04:20.400> have<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.760> think<00:04:20.910> about<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:22.340> once<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.460> did

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
we have to think about it and once I did

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.250 
we have to think about it and once I did
this<00:04:23.820> once<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.690> solution<00:04:24.930> for<00:04:25.080> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
this once I have a solution for the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.280 
this once I have a solution for the
problem

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
problem

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.140 
problem
I<00:04:26.350> can<00:04:27.310> go<00:04:27.460> on<00:04:27.640> yeah<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:29.310> say<00:04:30.310> thanks<00:04:31.120> for

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
I can go on yeah I say thanks for

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.050 
I can go on yeah I say thanks for
watching<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:32.790> yeah<00:04:33.790> see<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.810> soon
