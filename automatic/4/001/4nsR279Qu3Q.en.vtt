00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
like small quizzes big test that's why I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.319 
like small quizzes big test that's why I
got<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.280> many<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.000> fine<00:01:36.150> because

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
got so many but it's fine because

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.270 
got so many but it's fine because
they'll<00:01:36.570> probably<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.920> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
they'll probably use all them or at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
they'll probably use all them or at
least<00:01:38.520> most<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> them<00:01:39.360> hopefully<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.079> school

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
least most of them hopefully this school

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
basically it's like this tube I guess

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.250 
basically it's like this tube I guess
what's<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.820> best<00:03:12.300> way<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.480> could<00:03:12.690> describe<00:03:12.750> it

and then there's any racer in it and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
and then there's any racer in it and
then<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.690> pull<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.350> little<00:03:16.560> lever

then you can just pull this little lever
down<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.690> guess<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
down right here I guess and then the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.250
