00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.670 

looking<00:00:23.030> pretty<00:00:23.240> bright<00:00:23.600> when<00:00:24.110> I<00:00:24.260> just<00:00:24.440> look

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
looking pretty bright when I just look

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.319 
looking pretty bright when I just look
right<00:00:24.890> at<00:00:25.100> it

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.440 

basically<00:00:31.329> is<00:00:31.480> what<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:31.720> did

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
basically is what I did

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.950 
basically is what I did
is<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:35.210> modified<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.330> so<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> had<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.900> room

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
is I modified it so I had more room

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.460 
is I modified it so I had more room
inside<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.830> boiler<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.810> to<00:00:39.810> do<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
inside the boiler and to do this I

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:49.430 
inside the boiler and to do this I
dropped<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.070> V<00:00:41.850> bottom<00:00:42.330> down<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.820> remove<00:00:44.820> my

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.400 

moved<00:00:49.710> my

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.310 

make<00:00:55.010> sure<00:00:55.250> thing

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
make sure thing

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.960 
make sure thing
and<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.620> just<00:00:56.950> basically<00:00:57.160> put<00:00:57.640> an<00:00:57.790> air

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
and I just basically put an air

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.680 
and I just basically put an air
injection<00:00:58.180> in<00:00:58.720> there<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:02.610> mix<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.940> mix<00:01:04.300> extra

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
injection in there to mix the mix extra

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.440 
injection in there to mix the mix extra
air<00:01:04.840> for<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.230> secondary<00:01:05.770> burn<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
air for the secondary burn and in the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.760 
air for the secondary burn and in the
back<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.870> there<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.110> then<00:01:08.230> it<00:01:08.290> just<00:01:08.350> goes<00:01:08.590> down

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
back of there and then it just goes down

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.220 
back of there and then it just goes down
to<00:01:08.920> burn<00:01:09.130> town<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.610> whole<00:01:09.820> way<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.240> don't<00:01:11.170> know

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
to burn town the whole way I don't know

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.720 
to burn town the whole way I don't know
if<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.410> can<00:01:11.530> see<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.860> just<00:01:12.010> basically<00:01:12.370> put

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
if you can see that I just basically put

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.690 
if you can see that I just basically put
a<00:01:12.760> fire<00:01:13.030> brick<00:01:13.390> right<00:01:13.660> there<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.110> end<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
a fire brick right there on the end that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.330 
a fire brick right there on the end that
tunnel<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.520> kind<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.850> hard<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.120> see

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.459 

yeah<00:01:24.939> so

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
yeah so

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.569 
yeah so
so<00:01:26.950> anyway<00:01:27.250> there<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:29.579> focusing

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
so anyway there it is it's a focusing

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:38.530 
so anyway there it is it's a focusing
very<00:01:30.850> well

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.930 

that's<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.710> yeah<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.130> seems<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.490> be<00:01:40.580> working

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
that's it yeah it seems to be working

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.090 
that's it yeah it seems to be working
pretty<00:01:41.150> good<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.600> way<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.110> had<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.950> do<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
pretty good this way I had to do a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.800 
pretty good this way I had to do a
little<00:01:43.280> testing<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.030> know<00:01:44.150> mixing<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
little testing you know mixing the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.320 
little testing you know mixing the
different<00:01:45.290> air<00:01:45.710> mounts<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.430> hot<00:01:46.670> air<00:01:46.940> going<00:01:47.240> to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
different air mounts a hot air going to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.510 
different air mounts a hot air going to
the<00:01:47.450> secondary<00:01:47.930> burn<00:01:48.260> but<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.860> think<00:01:49.370> it's

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the secondary burn but I think it's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.230 
the secondary burn but I think it's
going<00:01:49.760> pretty<00:01:49.850> good<00:01:50.270> now

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.430 

I've<00:01:53.660> burned<00:01:54.020> tunnels<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.710> good<00:01:56.260> foot<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.410> a

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
I've burned tunnels a good foot and a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.990 
I've burned tunnels a good foot and a
half<00:01:57.590> long<00:01:59.740> seems<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.860> get<00:02:01.010> hot<00:02:01.250> enough

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
half long seems to get hot enough

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.050 
half long seems to get hot enough
in<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.690> burn<00:02:03.870> quite<00:02:04.260> well<00:02:05.060> anyway

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
in there to burn quite well anyway

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.180 
in there to burn quite well anyway
thought<00:02:06.360> I'd<00:02:06.450> let<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:07.800> see

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
thought I'd let you know see what see

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.540 
thought I'd let you know see what see
what's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.950> put<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:11.370> more

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
what's going on I just put some more

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.089 
what's going on I just put some more
wood<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.679 

so<00:02:16.549> you<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.730> see<00:02:16.909> there's<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.180> lot<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:17.450> blue<00:02:17.659> in

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
so you can see there's a lot of blue in

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.600 
so you can see there's a lot of blue in
that

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.950 
that
Cirie's<00:02:20.510> hard<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.140> focused<00:02:22.960> anyway

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
Cirie's hard to get that focused anyway

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.690 
Cirie's hard to get that focused anyway
just<00:02:24.110> put<00:02:24.350> some<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:24.650> wood<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.490> see

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
just put some more wood in you can see

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.780 
just put some more wood in you can see
the<00:02:25.850> flame<00:02:26.150> devil<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.660> bigger<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:28.160> secondary

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the flame devil a bigger that secondary

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
the flame devil a bigger that secondary
burn

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.250 

really<00:02:32.070> pretty<00:02:32.280> hot<00:02:32.490> burn<00:02:32.760> anyway<00:02:33.450> thought

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
really pretty hot burn anyway thought

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920 
really pretty hot burn anyway thought
shorty
