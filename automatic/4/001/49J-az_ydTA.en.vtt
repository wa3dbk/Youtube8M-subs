00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.400
 it's incredible 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.850
 this must be the core of the animus 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.480
 no simulations no environment but me 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.600
 I don't even feel the body is just data 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.410
 rough but they are always I have are one 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.410
 kind of program 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.579
 and home I was born here the farm yes 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.890
 my farm called her the farm 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:46.170
 twenty couples some children one 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.170
 hidden community 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.030
 small houses on the black hills already skies 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.550
 tersi firewood burnt wind and stink of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 diesel generators that went day 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.340
 it's night 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.290
 the memory we lived with almost nothing like 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.090
 nomads far from everything ready to do 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.260
 bundle sharpening at any time 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 if they found us if they did 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 had found 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.250
 the farm as well as there is very similar 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.310
 a real farm we cultivated something 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.260
 but I don't remember that there were animals 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.280
 maybe some dogs the killers are 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 born among them was not a choice 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.400
 been like a birthright 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 you are a murderer they told me what 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.880
 meant since I was little 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.690
 they never stopped repeating you are a 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.110
 murderess 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.300
 you are a murderer and this is ours 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.820
 I believe nothing is real 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.150
 what a world without it meant 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 purpose everything is permissible 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.990
 everything is permissible 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.609
 they are looking for us and will not stop 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.430
 until we are all dead 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.370
 certainly for a while I believed it but I didn't 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.469
 never understood and that's the problem when 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.659
 believe a similar situation 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.269
 without understanding 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.359
 they were all so serious but also 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.970
 scared all those talk up 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.150
 assassins and templars on the end of 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.150
 world 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:27.470
 according to the creed to be acquired 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.370
 everyone has their own image limits 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.350
 I don't remember when he stopped believing 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.590
 when I started to not care 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.660
 it all seemed so stupid to you not 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.360
 I could hear the word Templar without 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.360
 laugh not to mention murderer 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.560
 an ancient war said a struggle 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.970
 infinite but I didn't care to bore a 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.449
 child with war stories who 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.449
 he would have said 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.050
 I guess I was just alone in the middle 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.270
 to the crowd 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.200
 if I could have told someone maybe 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.200
 they would have listened to me 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.620
 if only I could go back and there 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.620
 I'm sorry
