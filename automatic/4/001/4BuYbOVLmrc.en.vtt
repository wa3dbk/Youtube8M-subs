00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
about the fit as you can see the fit and

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.040 
about the fit as you can see the fit and
finish<00:00:48.109> on<00:00:48.230> solids<00:00:48.649> very<00:00:49.280> very<00:00:49.579> good<00:00:49.820> aim<00:00:50.719> for

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.640 
here I also put this blast gate here
adjusting<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.910> allows<00:03:50.180> me<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.420> tune<00:03:50.750> how

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
adjusting this allows me to tune how

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.740 
adjusting this allows me to tune how
much<00:03:51.890> force<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.940> coming<00:03:53.210> through<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.480> one

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
much force is coming through this one

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.300 
much force is coming through this one
and<00:03:53.900> still<00:03:54.320> allows<00:03:54.500> suction<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.010> go<00:03:55.100> through

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
and still allows suction and go through

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.720 
and still allows suction and go through
here<00:03:56.800> allows<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.040> really<00:03:58.190> balance<00:03:58.430> out

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
here allows you to really balance out

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.000 
here allows you to really balance out
how<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.150> air<00:03:59.330> flows<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> salt<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.380> from

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
how the air flows to the salt and from

how the air flows to the salt and from
there<00:04:01.160> on<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.460> just<00:04:01.580> goes<00:04:01.760> into<00:04:02.180> my<00:04:02.870> dust

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
there on it just goes into my dust

collection system which is back there in

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.110 
collection system which is back there in
the<00:04:04.670> corner

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the corner

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.230
