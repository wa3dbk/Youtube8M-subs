00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
this is a sturdy gun safe that's been

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.960 
this is a sturdy gun safe that's been
modified<00:00:02.520> in<00:00:02.879> favor<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.710> thief<00:00:04.740> we<00:00:05.730> did

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
modified in favor of the thief we did

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.080 
modified in favor of the thief we did
this<00:00:06.150> because<00:00:06.390> we<00:00:06.629> didn't<00:00:07.319> think<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:08.090> they

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
this because we didn't think that they

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.629 
this because we didn't think that they
would<00:00:09.210> even<00:00:09.510> stand<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.929> chance<00:00:09.960> without

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
would even stand a chance without

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.220 
would even stand a chance without
modification<00:00:11.639> because<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.179> can't<00:00:12.480> get<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> big

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
modification because you can't get a big

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230 
modification because you can't get a big
heavy<00:00:13.559> pry<00:00:13.950> bar<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.580> thing<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
heavy pry bar now this thing here is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.740 
heavy pry bar now this thing here is
actually<00:00:16.020> plow<00:00:16.470> steel<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.850> can't<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.420> big

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actually plow steel you can't get big

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.109 
actually plow steel you can't get big
pry<00:00:19.080> bars<00:00:19.439> started<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.520> safe

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pry bars started on this safe

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.310 
pry bars started on this safe
so<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.660> ground<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:23.070> place<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> big<00:00:24.750> pry<00:00:25.050> bar

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so we ground a place for a big pry bar

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160 
so we ground a place for a big pry bar
and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.340> know<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.789> cheating<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> wanted<00:00:28.080> to

due to get surprised right again got it
almost<00:01:18.900> level

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.770 

it's<00:01:28.430> going<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.730> be<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> little<00:01:29.030> harder<00:01:29.480> than<00:01:29.510> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's going to be a little harder than I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.860 
it's going to be a little harder than I
thought<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.650> demonstrate<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.660> we've<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.840> a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
thought to demonstrate this we've got a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.650 
thought to demonstrate this we've got a
pry<00:01:33.170> bar<00:01:33.200> here<00:01:33.830> I'm<00:01:34.070> going<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.280> hand<00:01:34.580> off<00:01:35.120> of

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
pry bar here I'm going to hand off of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.390 
pry bar here I'm going to hand off of
this<00:01:35.810> he's<00:01:36.080> got<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.320> screwdriver<00:01:36.710> we're<00:01:37.160> going

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
this he's got a screwdriver we're going

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700 
this he's got a screwdriver we're going
to<00:01:37.490> try<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.730> see<00:01:37.970> we<00:01:38.180> can<00:01:38.330> wedge<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.170> there

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to try to see we can wedge that in there

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.950 
to try to see we can wedge that in there
not<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.160> word<00:01:40.370> weekend<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.390> bigger<00:01:41.630> pry

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
not the word weekend it's a bigger pry

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.430 
not the word weekend it's a bigger pry
bar<00:01:42.260> with<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.620> little<00:01:42.830> bit<00:01:42.980> better<00:01:43.190> code<00:01:44.440> so

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
bar with a little bit better code so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:02:02.170 
bar with a little bit better code so
let's<00:01:45.680> go<00:01:45.860> ahead<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.190> try<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:01.190> real<00:02:01.430> test<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
let's go ahead and try the real test is

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.390 
let's go ahead and try the real test is
and<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:02.870> get<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.170> open<00:02:03.500> enough<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.920> stick<00:02:04.190> one

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
and we get it open enough to stick one

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.469 
and we get it open enough to stick one
finger<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.320> all<00:02:06.320> right<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.680> got<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.040> with<00:02:07.479> that

the deadbolt to fly ms installed we

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.959 
the deadbolt to fly ms installed we
wouldn't<00:02:33.139> even<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> prayer<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.579> did<00:02:34.819> it
