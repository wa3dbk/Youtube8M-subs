00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.590 
to Turkey in Iran I'm now going to avoid
Pakistan<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.820> was<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.030> original<00:02:07.329> plan<00:02:07.479> but

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
Pakistan that was the original plan but

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.029 
Pakistan that was the original plan but
there's<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.140> few<00:02:08.380> things<00:02:08.590> going<00:02:08.800> on<00:02:08.830> there

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
there's a few things going on there

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.200 
there's a few things going on there
recently<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.460> think<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:09.789> probably<00:02:09.910> wise

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
recently and I think it's probably wise

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.270 
recently and I think it's probably wise
to<00:02:10.509> avoid<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.650> we're<00:02:11.740> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> go<00:02:12.040> around

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
to avoid it so we're going to go around

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.870
