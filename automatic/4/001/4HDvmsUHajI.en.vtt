00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.679 

all<00:00:01.890> right<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.190> we've<00:00:02.310> got<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.610> driver<00:00:03.449> side

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
all right so we've got the driver side

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.140 
all right so we've got the driver side
done<00:00:05.600> wanted<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.690> note<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.410> did<00:00:07.589> use

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
done wanted to note that I did use

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.660 
done wanted to note that I did use
anti-seize<00:00:09.290> compound<00:00:10.290> all<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> threads

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
anti-seize compound all on the threads

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.940 
anti-seize compound all on the threads
so<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.440> again<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
so if I have to do this again in the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.990 
so if I have to do this again in the
future<00:00:15.080> it<00:00:16.080> hopefully<00:00:16.830> won't<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.160> such<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> bear

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
future it hopefully won't be such a bear

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900 
future it hopefully won't be such a bear
to<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> nuts<00:00:18.810> off<00:00:19.580> just<00:00:20.580> trying<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> get

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to get the nuts off just trying to get

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.840 
to get the nuts off just trying to get
my<00:00:20.970> camera<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> focus<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.609> bolt<00:00:23.609> they're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
my camera to focus on the bolt they're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
my camera to focus on the bolt they're
seeking<00:00:24.410> few<00:00:25.410> threads<00:00:25.710> yeah<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> go

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
seeking few threads yeah there you go

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.210 
seeking few threads yeah there you go
you<00:00:26.430> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> anti-seize<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.539> there

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
you kind of see the anti-seize on there

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.749 
you kind of see the anti-seize on there
so<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> bolts<00:00:30.199> tightened<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.759> top

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so I got the bolts tightened down top

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.750 
so I got the bolts tightened down top
and<00:00:32.790> bottom<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.610> can

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and bottom and I don't know if you can

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600 
and bottom and I don't know if you can
see<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.210> clip<00:00:36.860> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> top<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> don't<00:00:38.430> think

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
see that clip at the top I don't think

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.930 
see that clip at the top I don't think
so<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:38.910> anyway<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.899> clip<00:00:40.140> goes<00:00:40.640> back<00:00:41.640> here

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so but anyway the clip goes back here

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
so but anyway the clip goes back here
let's<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.200> finger<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
let's see my finger there

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
let's see my finger there
of<00:00:44.520> course<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.910> bends<00:00:45.360> around<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.899> rests<00:00:46.410> on

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
of course it's bends around and rests on

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
of course it's bends around and rests on
top<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> frame<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.940> tighten<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
top of the frame as you tighten it and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.709 
top of the frame as you tighten it and
then<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.160> next<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.390> undo<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> it'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
then when next time you undo it it'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.910 
then when next time you undo it it'll
spin<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> other<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.199> hit<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> frame<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
spin the other way hit the frame of the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
spin the other way hit the frame of the
other<00:00:53.039> direction<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.760> anyway<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.930> side<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
other direction so anyway this side is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.569 
other direction so anyway this side is
done<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> move<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> other

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
done I'm going to move on to the other

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
done I'm going to move on to the other
side<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.059> quick<00:00:57.270> it'll<00:00:58.140> go<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> same

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
side really quick it'll go in the same

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
side really quick it'll go in the same
way<00:00:58.800> I'll<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.760> give<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> shot<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.329> I'm

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
way I'll just give you a shot when I'm

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.229 
way I'll just give you a shot when I'm
done<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.609> project<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> all

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
done and this little project will be all

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.929 
done and this little project will be all
wrapped<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:06.770> okay<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.159> finished<00:01:08.520> bolting

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
wrapped up okay I'm all finished bolting

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.410 
wrapped up okay I'm all finished bolting
up<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> shock<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.560> passenger<00:01:11.189> side<00:01:11.420> once

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
up the shock on the passenger side once

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.929 
up the shock on the passenger side once
again<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.720> used<00:01:13.200> anti-seize<00:01:14.189> compound<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
again I used anti-seize compound on the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.160 
again I used anti-seize compound on the
threads<00:01:15.060> top<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> bottom<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:18.049> once<00:01:19.049> again

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
threads top and bottom and once again

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
threads top and bottom and once again
you've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> clip<00:01:20.090> welded<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.210> nut<00:01:21.450> on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you've got a clip welded to the nut on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.310 
you've got a clip welded to the nut on
the<00:01:21.750> top<00:01:22.850> make<00:01:23.850> sure<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.119> orient<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the top make sure you orient it so that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.450 
the top make sure you orient it so that
it'll<00:01:25.439> hit<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> frame<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.460> towards

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it'll hit the frame you want it towards

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
it'll hit the frame you want it towards
the<00:01:29.610> center<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> vehicle<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:31.009> least

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the center of the vehicle here at least

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
the center of the vehicle here at least
that's<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.310> chose<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.090> because

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that's what I chose to do just because

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.030 
that's what I chose to do just because
there's<00:01:33.810> hardly<00:01:33.869> any<00:01:34.229> clearance<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.829> put<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
there's hardly any clearance to put a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.010 
there's hardly any clearance to put a
wrench<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> future<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
wrench in here so in the future if you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330 
wrench in here so in the future if you
have<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.470> shock<00:01:37.680> off<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> replace

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
have to take this shock off to replace

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460 
have to take this shock off to replace
it<00:01:38.460> again<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> try<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it again you don't have to try to get a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.840 
it again you don't have to try to get a
wrench<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.430> easier<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
wrench in on this side it's easier to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
wrench in on this side it's easier to
get<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> bolt<00:01:43.110> head<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> outside<00:01:45.530> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
get to the bolt head from the outside so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
get to the bolt head from the outside so
anyway<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> way<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.159> chose<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
anyway that's the way I chose to do it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
anyway that's the way I chose to do it
and<00:01:48.829> really<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.850> wraps<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.979> only

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and really that wraps it up the only

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
and really that wraps it up the only
thing<00:01:53.280> left<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.939> put<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> spare<00:01:54.930> tire

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
thing left to do is put the spare tire

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.830 
thing left to do is put the spare tire
back<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.939> did<00:01:56.939> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> mention<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.689> might

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.539 
back I did want to mention you might
want<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> double<00:01:58.200> check<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> frame<00:01:59.040> above<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
want to double check the frame above the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
want to double check the frame above the
tire<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.390> couple<00:02:00.869> spots<00:02:01.159> where

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
tire you can see a couple spots where

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.370 
tire you can see a couple spots where
the<00:02:02.399> tire<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:02.790> actually<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.540> against<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the tire was actually up against the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
the tire was actually up against the
metal<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.009> guess<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> traps<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> moisture

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
metal and I guess it traps the moisture

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
metal and I guess it traps the moisture
and<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.320> caused<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.039> rust<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and it caused a little bit of rust so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
and it caused a little bit of rust so
I'm<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.140> brush<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.200> off<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.739> wire

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I'm going to brush that off with a wire

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.960 
I'm going to brush that off with a wire
brush<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.520> hit

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
brush and then hit

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.620 
brush and then hit
some<00:02:12.150> rust<00:02:12.990> primer<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.910> I'll<00:02:15.450> put<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
some rust primer and then I'll put the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.990 
some rust primer and then I'll put the
tire<00:02:15.810> back<00:02:16.020> up<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.640> something<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> look

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
tire back up so just something to look

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.820 
tire back up so just something to look
at<00:02:18.210> why<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> tire<00:02:18.990> down<00:02:21.500> all<00:02:22.500> told

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
at why you got the tire down all told

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.720 
at why you got the tire down all told
this<00:02:23.490> job<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.090> mean<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.800> wasn't<00:02:26.310> easy

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this job I mean really it wasn't easy

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210 
this job I mean really it wasn't easy
but<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.540> not<00:02:27.690> complicated<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.100> took

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
but it's not complicated I think it took

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.540 
but it's not complicated I think it took
me<00:02:29.280> probably<00:02:30.290> four<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.410> five<00:02:31.590> hours<00:02:32.010> which<00:02:32.190> is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
me probably four to five hours which is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.120 
me probably four to five hours which is
really<00:02:32.610> sad<00:02:33.090> honestly<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.830> reason<00:02:35.100> for

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
really sad honestly but the reason for

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.790 
really sad honestly but the reason for
that<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> bolts<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.230> passenger<00:02:37.620> side

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
that was the bolts on the passenger side

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.370 
that was the bolts on the passenger side
were<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.090> stuck<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.600> top<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.260> I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
were just really stuck up top and I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.490 
were just really stuck up top and I
struggled<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:40.860> them<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> long<00:02:41.400> time<00:02:42.500> my

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
struggled with them for a long time my

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.380 
struggled with them for a long time my
advice<00:02:43.770> would<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.280> start<00:02:44.670> hitting<00:02:44.940> your

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
advice would to be start hitting your

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
advice would to be start hitting your
bolts<00:02:45.690> with<00:02:45.870> PB<00:02:46.140> Blaster<00:02:46.590> two<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.010> three<00:02:47.190> days

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
bolts with PB Blaster two or three days

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000 
bolts with PB Blaster two or three days
before<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.880> plan<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.090> doing<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.800> just<00:02:49.800> a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
before you plan on doing this just a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
before you plan on doing this just a
couple<00:02:50.459> times<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.850> day<00:02:50.880> repeatedly<00:02:51.660> spray<00:02:52.260> them

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
couple times a day repeatedly spray them

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.680 
couple times a day repeatedly spray them
and<00:02:52.940> hopefully<00:02:53.940> by<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.090> time<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.630> to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and hopefully by the time you go to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.130 
and hopefully by the time you go to
actually<00:02:55.050> remove<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.650> shocks<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:57.209> stuff

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
actually remove the shocks that stuff

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.130 
actually remove the shocks that stuff
will<00:02:58.320> break<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.220> rust<00:02:59.430> free<00:02:59.840> if<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.990> weren't

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
will break the rust free if it weren't

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.930 
will break the rust free if it weren't
for<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.950> could<00:03:02.070> honestly<00:03:02.490> do<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.790> in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
for that you could honestly do this in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.690 
for that you could honestly do this in
probably<00:03:03.270> an<00:03:03.480> hour<00:03:03.570> or<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.459> it's

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
probably an hour or so you know it's

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.130 
probably an hour or so you know it's
only<00:03:05.790> four<00:03:06.090> bolts<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.870> hard<00:03:07.020> it's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
only four bolts it's not that hard it's

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.810 
only four bolts it's not that hard it's
just<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> clearance<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.430> rust<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.730> you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
just the clearance and the rust that you

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.290 
just the clearance and the rust that you
have<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.090> fight<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.630> anybody<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.300> I'm

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
have to fight so anybody can do this I'm

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.620 
have to fight so anybody can do this I'm
not<00:03:12.360> sure<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> shop<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.320> charge<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.850> know

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
not sure what a shop would charge I know

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.120 
not sure what a shop would charge I know
when<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> looked<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:16.320> my<00:03:16.470> invoice<00:03:16.800> from<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
when I looked at my invoice from the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.259 
when I looked at my invoice from the
last<00:03:17.310> time<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.550> had<00:03:17.700> these<00:03:17.820> done<00:03:18.030> by<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
last time I had these done by the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.420 
last time I had these done by the
mechanic<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.930> thought<00:03:19.709> there's<00:03:19.920> no<00:03:20.100> way<00:03:20.250> I'm

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
mechanic I thought there's no way I'm

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.280 
mechanic I thought there's no way I'm
going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.330> again<00:03:21.420> I'll<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.140> myself

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
going to do that again I'll do it myself

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.600 
going to do that again I'll do it myself
I<00:03:22.680> think<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.890> was<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> couple<00:03:23.130> hundred<00:03:23.459> bucks

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
I think it was a couple hundred bucks

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.170 
I think it was a couple hundred bucks
for<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.940> rear<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.590> anyway<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:26.610> hope<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.030> video

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
for the rear so anyway I hope this video

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.350 
for the rear so anyway I hope this video
will<00:03:27.360> be<00:03:27.450> helpful<00:03:27.720> helpful<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:29.360> again
