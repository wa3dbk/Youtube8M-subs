productive for the day well this
diggings<00:01:48.260> gonna<00:01:48.470> be<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.560> little<00:01:48.650> tougher<00:01:49.900> got

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
diggings gonna be a little tougher got

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.090 
diggings gonna be a little tougher got
less<00:01:51.080> material<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:57.410> whether<00:01:57.590> it's<00:01:57.680> probably

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
less material it's whether it's probably

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.350 
less material it's whether it's probably
more<00:01:58.340> realistic<00:01:58.820> you're<00:01:59.090> gonna<00:01:59.180> probably

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
more realistic you're gonna probably

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.640 
more realistic you're gonna probably
cover<00:01:59.660> more<00:01:59.870> real<00:02:00.080> estate<00:02:00.200> I'll<00:02:00.500> probably

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
cover more real estate I'll probably

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:18.670 
cover more real estate I'll probably
cover<00:02:00.890> more<00:02:01.100> hauling<00:02:05.560> now<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.010> wash<00:02:07.280> it

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
we'll want to roll around this way

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:51.830 
we'll want to roll around this way
and<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:36.450> flop<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:50.240> might<00:02:51.240> help<00:02:51.450> guys<00:02:51.660> but

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
but that's what's how its intruder this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.960 
but that's what's how its intruder this
is<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> whole<00:03:08.190> number

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
is a whole number

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.540 
is a whole number
yeah<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.290> spacing<00:03:10.860> that's<00:03:11.160> water

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
yeah but your spacing that's water

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.760 
yeah but your spacing that's water
erosion<00:03:11.970> yeah<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> calcite

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
erosion yeah but it's to the calcite

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.430 
erosion yeah but it's to the calcite
this<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.640> quartz<00:03:15.060> though<00:03:15.300> in<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.230> this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
this is quartz though in here in this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.990 
this is quartz though in here in this
well<00:03:16.740> that's<00:03:16.830> yeah<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.250> quartz<00:03:17.790> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
well that's yeah that's quartz is
