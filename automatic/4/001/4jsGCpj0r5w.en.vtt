00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.990
 because today we make a second 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.100
 excursion in the direction of the saturation 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.769
 anti down rocky in co-production our 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.779
 forums couple revier am and me ours 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.760
 forum fairy tale has left me a link 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.730
 I am usually not sent 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 excited about fitness and or or 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 then lifestyle magazine 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.149
 to quote something and then not the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.870
 Properly specify the source of the dollar correctly 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.910
 but at the saturation and the same 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 again very briefly in the direction of muscle 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.010
 to fail 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.640
 Of course we always speak of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 Of course, subjective things can do that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 Body feeling that is a completely different feeling 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 to be from you now from you 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 or mine so that's always 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 subjectively what is a second here now 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.809
 try the seats I call now 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.000
 Just try the sydney in there 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 sydney were conducted with 240 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.689
 calorie units that means you have 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.689
 then certain foods to the people 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.150
 given and always 240 calories of that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.060
 means the quantity has of course varied 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.880
 in terms of how many calories per 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.100
 grams of data or per 100 grams in there 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.409
 are so to speak 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 I called him recently for 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.820
 around 800 calories with a watermelon 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.710
 to eat so in the end because of that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 video of yesterday if I of course too 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 800 calories with a watermelon 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.939
 I want to eat two kilos or two 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 eat two and a half kilos of it when I am 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.990
 but may only eat three popp sausages 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 that means, of course, have the sausages 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 actually more fat and you should 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.899
 I do not mean it anymore but I'm allowed to 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.409
 Of course, within 45, it's sitting 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.140
 maybe half a kilo of watermelon 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.770
 So eat again the unit is 240 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.740
 have been calories and you have everyone again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.210
 15 minutes the subjective so that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.730
 even from this person felt 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.680
 satiety checks times said na 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.900
 and how are you feeling? 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.360
 still saturated yes no maybe short 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.850
 on 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.420
 Weißbrodt then you have the unit 100th 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.720
 given 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.250
 So you did that differently than 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.900
 now at the last saturation sin 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.500
 You really have dexter with 0 to 5 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.150
 worked 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.830
 we just had whitewashed 100 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.240
 given quite similar to the biological 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.250
 valence where you once said 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.960
 has get 100 gives but then in 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.520
 end effect if you have something when you something 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.530
 want to use to calculate something 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.230
 it is a problem but as I said it 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.760
 is a purely subjective thing there 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 a completely different story so that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 if you are even if something under 100 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.900
 it has less in this table 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.910
 city ​​knows as white bread and said i can 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.670
 tell setting reviews of things 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.870
 Food has more than 100 there 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.600
 There are many top ten 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.580
 I think that's good because they can 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.990
 maybe the people too 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.020
 bit of carbs in the diet 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.640
 want to have in a world and just 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.950
 not on this on this low carb 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.110
 can drive there maybe 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.890
 can be a bit better 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:29.040
 find out about potatoes 323 323 times 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:34.160
 sorry was 323 times city ​​because of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.070
 as white-bread lean fish 225 times 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.260
 saturating as white bread porridge 209 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.680
 So off to the baby department nice 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.270
 semolina porridge or beautiful buy 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.730
 that gives saturation that is in the stomach 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.550
 probably not like a stone 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.030
 Well, imagine more about me that means there 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.410
 So we can with oatmeal with 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.270
 Oatmeal with purchased 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.460
 oatmeal I think in England is 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.440
 At least I think porridge 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.280
 So there you could because you could 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.190
 probably already good 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.990
 Design meals so that you 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.580
 in fact , especially sat 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.470
 I also find potatoes and leaner 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.810
 Fish gives a great lunch and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.139
 an awesome dinner now for example 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.970
 orange for me 202 that's all right again 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.110
 Similarly, we have fruit in it again 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.120
 apple 10 7 197 so both actually 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.460
 twice as filling as white bread in 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.490
 same calories at 240 calories 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.640
 whole wheat pasta perfect pasta 188 back 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:44.190
 that fat so like the meat 176 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:47.290
 But you have to eat beans when you are 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.270
 especially great praises be on the road 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.010
 would also like to bean beans 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.930
 actually a protein-rich 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.090
 but food is pouring a lot 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.550
 insulin out but to the insulin index 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.190
 we'll probably come to the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.810
 next few days grapes 162 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.290
 Vollkornbrot 157 these are the top top 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.110
 th 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.120
 but the top ten of the sydney try 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.990
 so quite a few others 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.700
 things here 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.600
 that means if you're probably now 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.690
 now maybe with the 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.180
 probably the factor of here compare 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.070
 would like to combine or then can 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.750
 you of course in his potatoes with 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.289
 his lean fish also bullish 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.270
 great to do so and as a dessert 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.260
 Watermelon a grapefruit an orange 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.900
 or eat an apple 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.140
 yes, these are orange apple is also in 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.880
 sydney try or join 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.360
 maybe popcorn food ever 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.330
 after I think that's 20 now 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.550
 i'll say a service and 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.440
 overlap and oatmeal and and 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.660
 and oatmeal I'm going to sit down now 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.880
 Immediately we think we overlap 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.910
 So we have four foods 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.090
 about 14 15 foods with those 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.910
 we think a diet is just fine 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.380
 Of course you can 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.169
 leave room for other things 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.840
 that you may prefer, like 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.450
 said that's saturation diet 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.710
 hunger pipapo that's all 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.410
 is subjective 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.360
 but I hope that and that too 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.160
 video from yesterday helped further 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.580
 See you next time 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.580
 take care
