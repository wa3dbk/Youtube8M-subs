00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Everyone is quiet, everything is quiet. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.599
 there a good new car and again I made a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 video on the other channel still in the window 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.549
 the world talking about the issue of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.130
 prayer and showed in the inclusive I made a mistake 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 on the question of the sum of the shares 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.449
 I wanted to take this matter because it has 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 a lot of people talking if it was not for 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.609
 enormous amount of prayers there. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.619
 Brazil is worse than many people who 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 still think that the fact of the quantity of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 prayers made in our country 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 The fact of making millions keeps 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 injecting I wanted to return to this subject 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.230
 For history if once and for all that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 The prayer factor has nothing to do with a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 country is better or worse this has nothing 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 pump and according to the last census 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 the 2011 census 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 our country has 190,755,799 people 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 according to the last sense having people 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
 if anyone has a newer sense there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.250
 The only one I found a given and religious 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.530
 is the 2000 license agreement and three 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.860
 million two hundred thirty-four thousand and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 four did not have a religion or did not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 not determine whether or not to declare 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 some 93% of the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.689
 population is religious 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 in that 93%, just like everything else in the Catholic 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.960
 Evangelical Jewish Umbanda and so on 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 doing the math I'll summarize if you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 I want to use it, I'll let everyone 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 the links below or also leave the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 excel file where I did the math and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.720
 let it be to see you 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.159
 will 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.159
 according to the calculations therein 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.290
 or more than 100 billion prayers 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.490
 This gives an average of 16,202 sentences per 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.070
 minute and 270 sentences per second 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.030
 then the average is almost 300 donations 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.890
 per second 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.180
 even so look at reality brazil 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.120
 occupies the 84th position of the idh is the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.910
 human development in Brazil the 38th 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.810
 country in the world in quality of life that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.060
 still has floor is the 28th still has much 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.460
 country ahead Brazil the third in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.310
 ranking of homicides in south america 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 life expectancy is 72 in Brazil 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 years occupying in the world ranking 92 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.400
 level of generosity of Brazilians 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.140
 is in 85th place 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.970
 is the most impressive of all in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.890
 my opinion is that whoever kills here in the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.770
 brazil brought back a bullet in the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.690
 head of anyone and you have 92 per 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.020
 chance of being unpunished 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.450
 the data is scary of opinion but 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 and you're talking about yourself, still good 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.130
 that in a country of so many people praying 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.930
 seek god who makes your prayers 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.310
 each in its own way then the people 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.260
 Talk but they're doing it wrong. 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.390
 independent of the market what is wrong 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.670
 to a certain super right or off'm 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.430
 wrong for one means we have a 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.310
 enormous diversity of possibilities in 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.320
 terms of prayer so much as not 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 You're going to be wrong and a lot of prayer on this one. 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.930
 100 billion and prayers 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 I believe that at least 10% there 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.790
 hypothetically and it is a chance that is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.860
 right right 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.260
 and another that is many attempts then 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.730
 but I'll show you a heart. 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.770
 there is nothing of quality 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.150
 if you get the idh list from the index 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.489
 human development 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.830
 the country is in the first place in norway 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.780
 you take to norway street then there is to do 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.070
 millions of hearts must overcome 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.560
 all limits known to man 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.690
 as Norway has four million 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.480
 nine hundred and twenty-two thousand three hundred 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.360
 and five people according to the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.380
 surveys I did 28% believe in God 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.209
 folks 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.030
 see the fact of believing in a god 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.400
 personal means talking 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.920
 prayers per month is not quite so, but I 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.520
 I'm going to take the currency as base. 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.160
 between the five countries - nj of the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.319
 not have an end in itself 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.360
 get that 28% and make the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.489
 You'll see that Norway does not arrive. 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.100
 or 1 percent of the time in 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.200
 Brazil is the Norwegians failed to 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.030
 live no percent of zero comma 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.510
 nine something like that 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.910
 is a totally absurd proportion is the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.530
 that the lady from Brazil is not and will not 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.140
 take into account I did the math 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.690
 It's how much prayer that is. 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.150
 remembering its 28 percent that 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 believe in God, personal all over the world 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.060
 on the basis of the content of the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.180
 number of prayers that are made in the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.950
 norway in 12 years in brazil is solved 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.770
 34 days 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.710
 So that means a joke so here in the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 Brazil is in comparison to the amount of 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.820
 donations 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.240
 the event in our Norway should be the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.610
 portal of hell online because 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.710
 amount of actions that one makes 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.140
 novel is and the first place in bh 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.720
 twice consecutively or 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.610
 considered according to research 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.080
 one of the best places to live in 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.720
 terms of quality of life 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.960
 Norway is also among the countries 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.690
 extremely low homicide rate and 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.500
 according to ong save the children is to save 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.750
 the children 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.789
 Norway is the best country for you to be 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.620
 mother for you to have a child leads was 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.800
 considered to be one of the best 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.600
 For you, it's your family. 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.840
 life expectancy is higher than in the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.800
 Brazil then life expectancy 83 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.280
 years and she she occupies different from Brazil 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.350
 who is 90 is pushed she occupies the 14th 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.960
 position otherwise indicated also 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.330
 There are eight women who can not pay 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.100
 to research and to know that this is what I did 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.990
 a graph if you look at a graph in 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.220
 a country that passes in quantity 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.890
 Prayers are the United States. 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.890
 300 million people out of it to you 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.760
 go see the chart is a look at norway 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.100
 china to see in a non feirinha 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.360
 bikinis the amount of prayers made 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.360
 in 12 years 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.250
 So you see Brazil, this little taste. 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.790
 Norway is just that anyway. 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.440
 thin so it's icon and the piccolo 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.390
 amount of options that are made states 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.640
 obviously together more than half 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.610
 taking an average of four actions per month 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.490
 so the numbers show that people 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.030
 it is once again the people who think that 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.160
 the fact that we are religious influences 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.380
 something does not influence anything 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.840
 Norway to reach 70% of the population 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.420
 in a lost a personal god 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.970
 most people there are not religious 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.580
 as has already been observed in lesser 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.980
 11 and that is why the country is a 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.040
 hell is a kingdom of the capet 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.160
 the country does not cause any 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.140
 destruction so used the argument that 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.520
 here in brazil how many do 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.860
 Prayers, right? 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.180
 if it were not for this solution it would be worse but 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.250
 there in the northeast 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.380
 It's not time for you to do the same. 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.490
 research I did the coral where 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.050
 search the data 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.030
 You will see that the heart does not 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.830
 influences nothing that changes as you say 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.810
 in previous books practice attitude o 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.419
 people's behavior is the 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.150
 commitment of people to make a 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.690
 society and look for your nef 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.910
 Here it goes 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.590
 yesterday the staff then the video of today 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.470
 about this if you do this with others 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.640
 countries also have the Swedish brand you 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.540
 see that you will arrive at the same 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.040
 result 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.330
 if you look through the prism of prayer 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.340
 prayer does not solve anything in terms of 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.260
 country to see a new vision does not solve 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.760
 nothing personal 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.320
 I thank you all and do not 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.360
 subscribe to my new channel on my 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.060
 facebook continue even if you do 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.950
 a question, any questions, what have you got? 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.140
 you do not remember 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.090
 spring can come in will ask questions 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.420
 A hug to everyone there until the next video 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.420
 thanks
