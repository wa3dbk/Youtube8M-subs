 who does not know that 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.400
 in the over 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.220
 In many cases, the battery is already after 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.470
 surf some phone calls on the internet 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.090
 watch videos and listen to music quickly 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.200
 empty 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.580
 The industry has one 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.340
 come up with new trick 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.869
 there are now akkupacks in the trade 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.520
 akkupacks at a variety of prices 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 with a variety of services 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.440
 and gimmicks five batteries we have ourselves 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.000
 views for you and the way 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.590
 and the handling tested the pl 101 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.100
 5200 milliamps with integrated lan 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.739
 wlan internally four gigabytes of memory 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 Upgradeable up to 64 GB and one USB 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.790
 connection with the mandates at his 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.430
 smartphone or tablet can transmit 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.080
 The price for this battery pack could be from 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 Unfortunately, the company can not be named 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.909
 only so much that the battery pack as 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.339
 external multimedia center up to 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.699
 20 devices can be used simultaneously 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.830
 can 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.840
 The next Chinese battery pack has 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.590
 an output of 15 1000 milliamps 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.240
 The loading time is one and a half days 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 an integrated lamp for whatever 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.160
 because the battery packs or so lights up 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.870
 mirror when turned on to a 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.090
 Chinese picture will and unfortunately too 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.630
 lit so the power is consumed 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 what is a pity on the USB port you can 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.430
 Two devices operate a smartphone and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.650
 a tablet pc for the smartphone 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 you use the five volt 1 ampere 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.660
 output at the second connection can be 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 a second smartphone or one too 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.800
 connect another tablet pc 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 the output power of the connections is 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.150
 different but also well marked 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.670
 usb 1 5 volt 1 amp usb 2 521 ampere 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.350
 performance even in this case could 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.400
 our selling price for germany still 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.980
 not to be named 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.920
 The battery packs of the 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.830
 Company pmg fell like a leg 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.440
 ten in 2013 three different ones 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.810
 akkupacks before but at more accurate 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.489
 said powerpacks are called the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.280
 special features of these powerpacks are 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.560
 that all three have an aluminum housing part 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.810
 own a digital display over 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.610
 This indicator is the charging state and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 the battery consumption good to recognize 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.380
 The powerbags are available in 2600 5200 7800 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.020
 million 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.650
 here bmw has good thoughts about the 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.170
 usability of your power packs 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.780
 the 2600 milliampere has one 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 output from one ampere all three batteries 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.310
 are delivered with a usb cable there 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.660
 both to load the power pack as 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.750
 also to charge the smartphone or 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.420
 The portal will serve over a tablet 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 USB chess or a USB power adapter loaded 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.460
 the display shows the respective 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.590
 Charge of the pack to the 5200 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.210
 milliampere powerpack has two usb 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.010
 power supply connections 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.930
 It can thus be a smartphone and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.590
 a tray pc at the same time with electricity 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 supply 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.630
 the big brother of the power pack series 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.610
 by bmw is with 7800 milliampere 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.280
 Also available here is one 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.050
 LED display installed by default 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.310
 charging and charging state of power 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.920
 to display packs 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.750
 the usability of the forex results 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.240
 from the battery power of each 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.800
 smartphones 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.720
 when a powerpack can be charged 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.130
 one for 1000 milliamps always one 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.950
 hour charging time 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.780
 this is the case with the 2600 milliamps 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.200
 A charging time when the powerpack is empty 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.510
 is just under three hours at 5200 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.170
 a loading time of at least 5 hours 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.090
 we have the 7800 milliampere powerpack 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.430
 only charged at night so it's on 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.950
 another day was fully operational again 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.050
 when connecting the power pack to a 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.150
 Smartphone has to be the one off button 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.100
 be pressed when you pack the power 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.740
 away from the smartphone turns off 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.630
 that will come on its own 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.340
 Taste serves that one also without that 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.770
 power pack to operate the charge state 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.440
 how much capacity the power can check 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.510
 pack still possesses the form and the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.200

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.630

 it adds value to the smartphone 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.370
 on the display is clearly readable and 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.859
