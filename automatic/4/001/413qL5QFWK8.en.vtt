00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
about being really tidy because of this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.620 
about being really tidy because of this
next<00:01:12.620> step<00:01:12.860> which<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.640> going<00:01:13.940> back<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.479> again

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
next step which is going back in again

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.910 
next step which is going back in again
with<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.200> e<00:01:15.229> 37<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.850> add<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.150> wood<00:01:17.330> grain<00:01:17.920> now

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
with the e 37 to add the wood grain now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.620 
with the e 37 to add the wood grain now
if<00:01:19.010> you<00:01:19.130> make<00:01:19.280> all<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.460> these<00:01:19.670> lines<00:01:20.000> super

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
if you make all of these lines super

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.899 
if you make all of these lines super
straight<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:21.290> get<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.440> ruler<00:01:21.680> out<00:01:21.799> or<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.729> try

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
straight you get a ruler out or you try

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.760 
straight you get a ruler out or you try
to<00:01:22.970> make<00:01:23.150> mall<00:01:23.390> evenly<00:01:23.870> spaced<00:01:24.260> it's<00:01:24.620> not

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
to make mall evenly spaced it's not

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.830 
to make mall evenly spaced it's not
going<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.979> look<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.130> wood<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.780> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
going to look like wood so this is a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.289 
going to look like wood so this is a
great<00:01:27.110> technique<00:01:27.350> for<00:01:27.860> newbie<00:01:28.400> beginners<00:01:28.850> to

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
great technique for newbie beginners to

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.130 
great technique for newbie beginners to
start<00:01:29.659> with<00:01:30.730> because<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:32.060> can<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.240> kind<00:01:32.990> of

start with because you can just kind of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
start with because you can just kind of
scribble<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.590> lines<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:34.070> there

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
I don't want to press very hard or the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.870 
I don't want to press very hard or the
lines<00:01:46.810> are<00:01:46.960> gonna<00:01:47.080> get<00:01:47.229> really<00:01:47.380> fat

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.420 

I'm<00:01:58.420> adding<00:01:58.719> a<00:01:58.810> little<00:01:58.960> bit<00:01:59.079> of<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.469> 29<00:01:59.950> under

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
I'm adding a little bit of a 29 under

I'm<00:02:47.460> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> use<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.030> branch<00:02:48.480> I'm<00:02:49.050> going

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'm going to use this branch I'm going

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
I'm going to use this branch I'm going
to<00:02:49.290> cut<00:02:49.410> off<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> bottom<00:02:50.160> part<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> use

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
to cut off the bottom part of it and use

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.570 
to cut off the bottom part of it and use
it<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.210> tree<00:02:51.600> using<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.770> tambo<00:02:53.280> dots

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.690 
it as a tree using this tambo dots
runner<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.710> just<00:02:56.280> puts<00:02:56.550> little

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
runner and it actually just puts little

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.120 
runner and it actually just puts little
dots<00:02:56.940> down<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.660> anywhere<00:02:58.500> where<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:58.830> not

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
dots down and anywhere where there's not

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.670 
dots down and anywhere where there's not
actually<00:02:59.460> stuff<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.810> sticks<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> paper

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
actually stuff it sticks to the paper

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.490 
actually stuff it sticks to the paper
underneath<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.580> I'm<00:03:02.670> using<00:03:02.850> scratch<00:03:03.240> paper

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
underneath so I'm using scratch paper

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.900 
underneath so I'm using scratch paper
but<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.590> does<00:03:04.740> not<00:03:04.860> stick<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.490> item<00:03:05.760> itself

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
but it does not stick to the item itself

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.940 
but it does not stick to the item itself
and<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.840> don't<00:03:06.990> get<00:03:07.170> all<00:03:07.290> those<00:03:07.410> stickies<00:03:07.920> on

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
and you don't get all those stickies on
the<00:03:08.250> front<00:03:08.520> like<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:09.060> sometimes<00:03:09.630> with

now I need to add my sentiment so I

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.400 
now I need to add my sentiment so I
looked<00:03:56.300> at<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> couple<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> other<00:03:56.990> papers

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
looked at a couple of the other papers

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.380 
looked at a couple of the other papers
in<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> collection<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.490> one<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.180> can't

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
in the collection that one you can't

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.900 
in the collection that one you can't
really<00:03:59.540> read<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> went<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.730> same

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910
