slightly hokey only because you got this

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.790 
slightly hokey only because you got this
nut<00:04:35.350> here<00:04:35.970> let's<00:04:36.970> see<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.270> nut<00:04:37.530> house<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
nut here let's see the nut house the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.420 
nut here let's see the nut house the
flat<00:04:39.070> washer<00:04:39.670> built<00:04:39.940> into<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:41.220> see<00:04:42.220> that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
flat washer built into it you see that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.470 
flat washer built into it you see that
and<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.860> washer<00:04:45.520> needs<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:45.910> go<00:04:46.030> up<00:04:46.180> tight

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
and that washer needs to go up tight

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.020 
and that washer needs to go up tight
there<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.050> when<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.260> put<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:47.950> put<00:04:48.820> this

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
there so when you put this you put this

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.390 
there so when you put this you put this
gasket<00:04:49.330> on<00:04:49.690> there<00:04:49.990> you're<00:04:50.800> only<00:04:50.920> hitting<00:04:51.130> the

edge<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.030> washer<00:04:52.600> now<00:04:52.780> some<00:04:53.370> some<00:04:54.370> nuts

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
edge of that washer now some some nuts

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.590 
edge of that washer now some some nuts
nowadays<00:04:55.360> our<00:04:56.130> fatter<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.880> almost<00:04:58.360> looked

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
nowadays our fatter that almost looked

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.650 
nowadays our fatter that almost looked
like<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:59.380> about<00:04:59.710> that<00:04:59.920> fat<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.700> both<00:05:01.240> sides

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
like like about that fat on both sides

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.590
