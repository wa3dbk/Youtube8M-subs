00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
in color well it's pretty quick i mean

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.680 
in color well it's pretty quick i mean
there's<00:03:35.190> no<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.670> delay<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.240> sending<00:03:36.420> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
there's no really delay in sending it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.210 
there's no really delay in sending it
here<00:03:36.870> depending<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> size<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:37.980> print

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
here depending on the size of the print

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.710 
here depending on the size of the print
job<00:03:38.250> yeah<00:03:38.610> obviously<00:03:38.880> for<00:03:39.180> sending<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> big

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
job yeah obviously for sending a big

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.180 
job yeah obviously for sending a big
batch<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:39.930> photos<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.680> could<00:03:40.830> take<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.010> little

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
batch of photos it could take a little

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
batch of photos it could take a little
longer<00:03:41.370> depending<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.120> what<00:03:42.390> what<00:03:42.840> standard

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
longer depending on what what standard

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.400 
longer depending on what what standard
you're<00:03:43.440> also<00:03:43.590> connected<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.310> g<00:03:45.000> or<00:03:45.360> n<00:03:45.410> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you're also connected with g or n the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.229 
you're also connected with g or n the
throughput<00:03:46.650> could<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.190> could<00:03:47.580> be<00:03:47.640> compromised

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
throughput could be could be compromised

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.750 
throughput could be could be compromised
but<00:03:48.510> no<00:03:49.050> terribly<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.580> bit

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
but no terribly it is it a little bit

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.490 
but no terribly it is it a little bit
slower<00:03:51.030> transferring<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.870> wirelessly<00:03:52.320> as

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
slower transferring it wirelessly as

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.890 
slower transferring it wirelessly as
opposed<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.950> cable<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.209> slightly<00:03:54.480> slower

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
opposed to a cable it is slightly slower

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.479 
opposed to a cable it is slightly slower
depending<00:03:55.260> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> guys<00:03:55.890> i<00:03:56.010> said<00:03:56.220> depending

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
depending on the guys i said depending

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.430 
depending on the guys i said depending
on<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> connection<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.600> know<00:03:57.959> what<00:03:58.230> most

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
on the connection but you know what most

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.600 
on the connection but you know what most
people<00:03:58.709> would<00:03:58.770> notice<00:03:58.950> how<00:03:59.130> i<00:03:59.160> mean<00:03:59.459> just

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
people would notice how i mean just

people would notice how i mean just
printed<00:03:59.880> right<00:03:59.970> away<00:04:00.209> when<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.230> could

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
printed right away when you you could

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.020 
printed right away when you you could
write<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.530> mean<00:04:01.830> yeah<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> print<00:04:02.610> job<00:04:02.640> I

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
write I mean yeah in the print job I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.910 
write I mean yeah in the print job I
mean<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.690> don't<00:04:04.110> necessarily<00:04:04.230> need<00:04:04.650> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
mean you don't necessarily need the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400 
mean you don't necessarily need the
print<00:04:05.459> job<00:04:05.670> right<00:04:06.180> away<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.390> mean<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.290> know

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
print job right away I mean you know

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.990 
print job right away I mean you know
pick<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:07.830> up<00:04:07.920> later<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.340> yeah<00:04:08.640> want<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
pick it up later on yeah want to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.190 
pick it up later on yeah want to
continue<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.390> work<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.630> think<00:04:09.810> my<00:04:09.900> wife<00:04:10.050> would

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
continue to work I think my wife would

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.000 
continue to work I think my wife would
like<00:04:10.320> something<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.830> because

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
like something like this because

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.320 
like something like this because
obviously<00:04:11.280> there's<00:04:11.670> not<00:04:11.820> like<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> three

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
obviously there's not like a three

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.760 
obviously there's not like a three
million<00:04:12.480> cables<00:04:12.959> snaking<00:04:13.170> through<00:04:13.380> your<00:04:13.650> home

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
million cables snaking through your home

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.229 
million cables snaking through your home
office<00:04:13.950> or<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.520> can<00:04:14.670> pretty<00:04:14.820> well<00:04:14.910> put<00:04:15.120> this

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
office or you can pretty well put this

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.120 
office or you can pretty well put this
in<00:04:15.420> anywhere<00:04:15.900> else<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.320> he<00:04:16.590> was<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.830> the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
in anywhere else and he was on the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.590 
in anywhere else and he was on the
wireless<00:04:17.400> correct<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.180> because<00:04:18.330> long<00:04:18.480> as

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
wireless correct if it because long as

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.420 
wireless correct if it because long as
the<00:04:18.690> access<00:04:18.959> points<00:04:19.260> easy<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.160> let's<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.370> a

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
the access points easy so let's have a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.580 
the access points easy so let's have a
look<00:04:20.580> at<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.730> back<00:04:20.880> here<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:22.169> essentially

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
look at the back here so essentially

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.110 
look at the back here so essentially
it's<00:04:22.710> just<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> one<00:04:23.040> power<00:04:23.190> cord<00:04:23.550> correct<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's just the one power cord correct and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.290 
it's just the one power cord correct and
and<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.200> your<00:04:25.440> wireless<00:04:25.740> adapter<00:04:26.340> it's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
and that is your wireless adapter it's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.810 
and that is your wireless adapter it's
not<00:04:27.600> easy<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.289> you<00:04:28.830> have<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.280> model<00:04:29.580> here<00:04:29.700> is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
not easy so you have this model here is

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.290 
not easy so you have this model here is
basically

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
basically

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.029 
basically
a copier<00:04:30.870> scanner<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.770> what<00:04:31.889> are<00:04:31.979> the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
a copier scanner for and what are the

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.580 
a copier scanner for and what are the
models<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.430> from<00:04:32.669> this<00:04:32.789> one<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:34.379> this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
models up from this one so this in this

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.649 
models up from this one so this in this
in<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.949> spring<00:04:35.220> launch<00:04:35.460> this<00:04:35.879> is<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
in the spring launch this is the the

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.350 
in the spring launch this is the the
model<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.520> top-of-the-line<00:04:38.729> model

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
model that is the top-of-the-line model

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.749 
model that is the top-of-the-line model
we<00:04:39.449> also<00:04:39.599> have<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.930> model<00:04:40.319> that's<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.770> 3550

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
we also have a model that's the 3550

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.089 
we also have a model that's the 3550
which<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.449> similar<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.169> it's<00:04:43.470> print<00:04:43.800> scan

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
which is similar to this it's print scan

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.520 
which is similar to this it's print scan
copy<00:04:44.240> however<00:04:45.240> its<00:04:45.389> wildest<00:04:45.720> upgradeable<00:04:46.319> so

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
copy however its wildest upgradeable so

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.379 
copy however its wildest upgradeable so
end-users<00:04:47.250> if<00:04:47.490> they<00:04:47.819> don't<00:04:47.970> need<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.210> print

end-users if they don't need to print
wireless<00:04:48.750> today<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:49.289> think<00:04:49.590> they<00:04:49.680> might<00:04:49.889> need

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
wireless today but think they might need

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.969 
wireless today but think they might need
the<00:04:50.449> functionality<00:04:51.449> in<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.569> future<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.770> can

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
the functionality in the future you can

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.490 
the functionality in the future you can
choose<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.340> buy<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.629> 3550<00:04:54.629> at<00:04:54.720> 99<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.470> then

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
choose to buy the 3550 at 99 and then

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.070 
choose to buy the 3550 at 99 and then
purchase<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.280> adapter<00:04:56.699> on<00:04:56.879> lexmark<00:04:57.300> CA<00:04:57.750> at<00:04:58.020> a

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
purchase the adapter on lexmark CA at a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.050 
purchase the adapter on lexmark CA at a
future<00:04:58.289> date<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:58.979> plug<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.370> in<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.699> you

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
future date and just plug it in and you

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.450 
future date and just plug it in and you
basically<00:05:00.270> have<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> wireless<00:05:01.020> printer<00:05:01.650> as<00:05:02.250> far

as setting it up with the wireless is
right<00:05:04.560> how<00:05:04.770> much<00:05:05.430> knowledge<00:05:05.699> you<00:05:05.969> have<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.180> do
