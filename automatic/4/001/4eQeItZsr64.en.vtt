00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.719
 come ready to play 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.630
 recommended 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 pachuca 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 it's ugly I like we love you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.629
 you are playing almost man right now 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.629
 well I'm ready and pocholo 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.559
 one 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.250
 this time I behaved well as a tone 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.350
 with a shit loading the pacifier 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.350
 Leave me some tour or fucking son 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.750
 I've seen these contacts 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 stuck 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.890
 it already has the stalemate 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 this character can not do anything else 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:58.869
 but if this is normal 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.869
 the point is worth more delayed 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.289
 that moment 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.150
 kid did it in first person in my 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.950
 lifetime 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.739
 because that was to have flown by the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.209
 wooded 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:22.390
 power when arrived now I have arrived 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.390
 finally now waiting for me from this 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.859
 with the palm tree 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.889
 To my uncle 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.799
 sitting on the shale motorcycle what 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.859
 I have complicated to catch nothing I 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.859
 I think 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.150
 turbos here and here 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.200
 to the stands and that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.130
 but that just after the arrival of the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.550
 option like that so it is wrongly done 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.550
 ramp in a few words is already there 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.660
 the nail in the dock 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.480
 I fly high meters but for 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.850
 where I come and lost very well very well 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.460
 very good very good uncle water 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.460
 but how is uncle gone 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.840
 a position and everything that happens to me 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.870
 Hold on and hold on 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.120
 we want me to wait for you here in summer 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.659
 or the aunt measured with the ramp that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.659
 he said 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.439
 this I say everything but they are missing 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.439
 to place second 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:52.280
 it was no longer broken if you listen to this 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.569
 points step or did not arrive yet happened to me 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:01.449
 but not because you have to catch what 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:01.449
 justito I can not believe that I 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.409
 but you can not pass the ite and 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.349
 now you'll see 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:14.129
 now he tells me game the wife had 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:14.129

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:38.769

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:42.539
 to orange and hit a jump basically 

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:42.539

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:51.749
 this kid is worth kid, I 'm going to 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.369

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:57.939
 tranquil 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:59.769
 if you can not break that is done 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:05.649
 Get off the bike so Carlos Carlos and 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:07.979
 hit a jump and throwing a c4 does not 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.979
 break 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.290
 you do not know the beautiful utilities of the 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.290

 but it does not leave you lying 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:51.639
