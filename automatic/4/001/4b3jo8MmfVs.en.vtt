00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the frizz it does a little bit for but

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
the frizz it does a little bit for but
for<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> most<00:02:12.540> part<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.870> me<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.200> adds

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
for the most part for me it just adds

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.030 
for the most part for me it just adds
and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.810> way<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.260> looks<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.770> put

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and I like the way it looks when I put

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.560 
and I like the way it looks when I put
the<00:02:17.160> oil<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.700> versus<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.240> because<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
the oil on there versus not because it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.150 
the oil on there versus not because it
makes<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.050> shiny<00:02:19.320> as<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.770> see<00:02:19.980> in
