00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Wi-Fi is like this is a really good

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.209 
Wi-Fi is like this is a really good
example<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.870> i<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.649> only<00:00:49.980> had

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
example of that so i actually only had

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
example of that so i actually only had
three<00:00:50.640> pokemon<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.420> qualified<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

three pokemon that qualified for the
level<00:00:53.160> 50<00:00:53.850> thing<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> ones<00:00:55.170> i

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
level 50 thing and those are the ones i

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
level 50 thing and those are the ones i
brought<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:56.760> one<00:00:56.940> being<00:00:57.120> sceptile

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
brought the first one being sceptile

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
brought the first one being sceptile
because<00:00:57.960> i<00:00:58.079> saw<00:00:58.500> most<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> team<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because i saw most of the team was like

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.900 
because i saw most of the team was like
tyranitar<00:01:00.000> greninja<00:01:00.390> whatever<00:01:01.609> al<00:01:02.609> obvious

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
tyranitar greninja whatever al obvious

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.020 
tyranitar greninja whatever al obvious
he<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.270> week<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.460> grass<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
he was actually week to my grass of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
he was actually week to my grass of
attacks<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.689> i<00:01:06.720> figured<00:01:07.110> i'd<00:01:07.200> leave<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
attacks so i figured i'd leave with that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.469 
attacks so i figured i'd leave with that
but<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:07.890> once<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.280> let<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:09.090> sceptile

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
but then once I let off with my sceptile

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
but then once I let off with my sceptile
he<00:01:09.659> led<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.110> Virginia<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> assumed<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
he led all from Virginia I assumed it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
he led all from Virginia I assumed it
