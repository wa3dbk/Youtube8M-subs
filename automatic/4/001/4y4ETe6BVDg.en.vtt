00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
do on offense and we just changed our we

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.780 
do on offense and we just changed our we
just<00:05:59.260> kind<00:05:59.440> of<00:05:59.470> shifted<00:05:59.920> to<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.160> strength<00:06:00.580> and

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
just kind of shifted to the strength and

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.510 
just kind of shifted to the strength and
uh<00:06:00.970> and<00:06:01.570> we<00:06:02.050> just<00:06:02.260> shot<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.560> gaps<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.130> later

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
uh and we just shot the gaps and later

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.920 
uh and we just shot the gaps and later
it<00:06:03.730> seemed<00:06:03.910> like<00:06:04.150> I'm<00:06:04.240> looking<00:06:04.510> at<00:06:04.600> this<00:06:04.690> sheet

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
it seemed like I'm looking at this sheet

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.470 
it seemed like I'm looking at this sheet
here<00:06:05.260> and<00:06:05.640> nobody<00:06:06.640> really<00:06:06.850> stands<00:06:07.150> out<00:06:07.330> on

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
here and nobody really stands out on

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.120 
here and nobody really stands out on
defense<00:06:07.960> we're<00:06:08.200> always<00:06:08.380> getting<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.950> ball
