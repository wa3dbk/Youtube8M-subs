00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.380
 I approach you with everything I have, now I can not go back 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.060
 This is clearly a complete addiction so bad that nobody can stop it 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.780
 Your love, your love, all I want is your love. I'm drunk with ecstasy 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.440
 Oh she loves me, Oh she has me, Oh she hurts me 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.040
 What else could be better than this 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.060
 Someone call the doctor, hug me and tell me 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 Love is a disease, an addiction, overdid 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 It is more difficult to control time 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.720
 I'm falling deeply into it 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:08.320
 Too much, it's you, your love, this is overdose 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.780
 Seeing you inside makes me love you even more, after my breathing accelerates and drowns 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 I feel a sigh and then a chill 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 Your love, your love is like poison to me, I can not escape 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.340
 My blood warms up and she controls all of my 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.580
 Oh she loves me, Oh she has me, Oh she hurts me 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.040
 What else can I do better than this? 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.100
 Someone call the doctor, hug me and tell me 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
 Love is a disease, an addiction, overdid 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.840
 It is more difficult to control time 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.940
 I'm falling deeply into it EH OH 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:04.940
 Too much, it's you, your love, this is overdose 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.220
 Everyone asks me if I have changed 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.120
 As if you were stuck in my heart 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.060
 My world is full of you 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 I can not stop I'm full of you 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.200
 Now, in this moment, you are in my heart 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.560
 EXO 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.560
 I taste you and I take you 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.940
 My heart trembles, I get to have you but it's not enough 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.340
 This thirst sends chills to the tips of my fingers 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 Hold on to this moment, they are good, do not stop 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 Hey doctor, was not it? 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.100
 You and I will be with the uncontrollable attraction 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.160
 Without this feeling it is as if he were dead 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.220
 The reason why I live is because of your dullness 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.380
 Somebody call the doctor, I need it 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.080
 I will not be able to endure even one more day (not another day) 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.780
 You are an addiction that I do not want to escape from 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:22.740
 Too much (too much) are you, your love (your love) this is overdose 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.740
