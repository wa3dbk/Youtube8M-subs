that's<00:02:34.500> fucking<00:02:34.890> ridiculous<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
that's fucking ridiculous we have to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.940 
that's fucking ridiculous we have to
split<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.540> either<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> think

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
split that up but either way I think

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950 
split that up but either way I think
what<00:02:38.070> I've<00:02:38.190> decided<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.670> do<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.570> add<00:02:39.720> little
