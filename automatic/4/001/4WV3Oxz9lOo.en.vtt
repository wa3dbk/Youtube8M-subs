the<00:00:24.810> keyboard<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> might

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the keyboard which is as you might

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.990 
the keyboard which is as you might
expect<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.910> touchy<00:00:27.480> area<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.289> lenovo<00:00:28.800> fans<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
expect a touchy area for lenovo fans so

the<00:00:30.269> ThinkPad<00:00:30.660> x1<00:00:30.810> carbon<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> name<00:00:31.949> still

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the ThinkPad x1 carbon as the name still

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
the ThinkPad x1 carbon as the name still
suggests<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> carbon-fiber<00:00:33.930> lid<00:00:34.200> here

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
suggests there's a carbon-fiber lid here

suggests there's a carbon-fiber lid here
build<00:00:35.100> quality<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> still<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:35.969> excellent

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
build quality is still pretty excellent

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
build quality is still pretty excellent
on<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> bottom<00:00:37.500> though<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.250> have

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
on the bottom though you do now have

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.389 
on the bottom though you do now have
this<00:00:38.700> magnesium<00:00:39.360> alloy<00:00:40.040> mixed<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.280> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this magnesium alloy mixed in so it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
this magnesium alloy mixed in so it's
not<00:00:41.489> totally<00:00:41.910> carbon<00:00:42.239> fiber<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> build

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
not totally carbon fiber but the build

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
not totally carbon fiber but the build
quality<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.320> still<00:00:43.710> pretty<00:00:43.920> great<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
quality is still pretty great and it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
quality is still pretty great and it's
mostly<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> same<00:00:45.809> size<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.469> ever<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
mostly the same size as ever it's a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.369 
mostly the same size as ever it's a
little<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:47.190> lighter<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.670> bit<00:00:47.879> thinner

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
little bit lighter a little bit thinner

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
little bit lighter a little bit thinner
still<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> lightest<00:00:49.920> 14<00:00:50.370> inch<00:00:50.489> Ultrabook

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
still the lightest 14 inch Ultrabook

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
still the lightest 14 inch Ultrabook
around<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.719> hasn't<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.079> changed<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
around but that hasn't really changed so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
around but that hasn't really changed so
so<00:00:53.250> far<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> design<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> pretty<00:00:54.239> similar<00:00:54.600> what

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so far the design is pretty similar what

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.170 
so far the design is pretty similar what
lenovo<00:00:55.260> did<00:00:55.649> change<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> big<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
lenovo did change in a big way is the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
lenovo did change in a big way is the
keyboard<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> risky<00:00:58.530> move

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
keyboard and that's kind of a risky move

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
keyboard and that's kind of a risky move
considering<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.550> much<00:00:59.730> ThinkPad<00:01:00.660> diehards

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
considering how much ThinkPad diehards

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
considering how much ThinkPad diehards
love<00:01:01.530> their<00:01:01.739> keyboard<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> mention<00:01:02.789> their

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
love their keyboard not to mention their

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
love their keyboard not to mention their
signature<00:01:03.359> trackpad<00:01:03.899> their<00:01:04.199> track<00:01:04.500> point

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
signature trackpad their track point

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.750 
signature trackpad their track point
here<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.689> lenovo<00:01:07.049> did<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.710> brief<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
here so what lenovo did in brief is it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
here so what lenovo did in brief is it
moved<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> six<00:01:09.510> row<00:01:09.720> keyboard<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> can

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
moved from a six row keyboard as you can

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
moved from a six row keyboard as you can
see<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> five<00:01:11.220> row<00:01:11.400> keyboard<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.030> replace

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
see to a five row keyboard and replace

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
see to a five row keyboard and replace
that<00:01:12.840> function<00:01:13.590> row<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.700> adaptive

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that function row with this adaptive

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.679 
that function row with this adaptive
keyboard<00:01:16.380> panel<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> has<00:01:17.729> light-up

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
keyboard panel here so it has light-up

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
keyboard panel here so it has light-up
controls<00:01:19.350> touch<00:01:19.680> sensitive<00:01:20.189> controls<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
controls touch sensitive controls that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
controls touch sensitive controls that
vary<00:01:21.180> depending<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> application<00:01:22.530> you're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
vary depending on the application you're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
vary depending on the application you're
using<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.150> machine<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> smart<00:01:24.900> enough<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
using so the machine is smart enough to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
using so the machine is smart enough to
actually<00:01:25.350> cycle<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.130> let's<00:01:26.369> say<00:01:26.580> controls<00:01:27.119> for

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
actually cycle in let's say controls for

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.499 
actually cycle in let's say controls for
web<00:01:27.570> browsing<00:01:28.040> instead<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:29.939> regular

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
web browsing instead of you know regular

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
web browsing instead of you know regular
navigation<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> switch<00:01:32.460> yourself

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
navigation but you can switch yourself

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.539 
navigation but you can switch yourself
so<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.210> press<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> button<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
so you can press this button here and

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
so you can press this button here and
you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> cycle<00:01:36.090> through<00:01:36.119> anytime<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> want

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you can cycle through anytime you want

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.149 
you can cycle through anytime you want
and<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.320> set<00:01:40.590> all

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and if you want you can have it set all

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.359 
and if you want you can have it set all
the<00:01:41.520> time<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> particular<00:01:42.560> mode<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the time on a particular mode so that it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
the time on a particular mode so that it
never<00:01:44.640> changes<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.509> instance<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
never changes so for instance if you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
never changes so for instance if you
really<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.290> need<00:01:46.439> those<00:01:46.590> function<00:01:46.979> keys<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
really do need those function keys you

and<00:02:23.250> he<00:02:23.880> found<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.360> his<00:02:24.480> finger<00:02:24.900> kept

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and he found that his finger kept

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.950 
and he found that his finger kept
reaching<00:02:26.460> over<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.060> backspace<00:02:27.570> key<00:02:27.810> by

reaching over the backspace key by

reaching over the backspace key by

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the Delete key so that doesn't mean it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.920 
the Delete key so that doesn't mean it's
a<00:02:32.250> deal<00:02:32.400> breaker<00:02:32.610> per<00:02:32.910> se<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> think<00:02:33.420> people<00:02:33.750> can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
a deal breaker per se I think people can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.960 
a deal breaker per se I think people can
maybe<00:02:34.170> adapt<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> new<00:02:34.980> typing<00:02:35.400> style<00:02:35.640> but

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
maybe adapt to a new typing style but

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
maybe adapt to a new typing style but
just<00:02:36.210> know<00:02:36.930> there's<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.320> bit<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> a

just know there's a little bit of a

and<00:03:39.950> lenovo<00:03:40.950> also<00:03:41.250> did<00:03:41.370> some<00:03:41.550> fine-tuning

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
and lenovo also did some fine-tuning

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.820

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
lenovo included one the first time and

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.600 
lenovo included one the first time and
then<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.510> suddenly<00:04:58.660> poof<00:04:59.560> got<00:05:00.010> rid<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.400> in

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
then just suddenly poof got rid of it in

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.070 
then just suddenly poof got rid of it in
terms<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.210> performance<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:01.720> comes<00:05:01.960> with

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
terms of performance this comes with

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.540 
terms of performance this comes with
your<00:05:02.140> standard<00:05:02.590> array<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.950> Intel<00:05:03.340> Haswell

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
your standard array of Intel Haswell

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.380

options<00:05:07.810> we<00:05:07.930> already<00:05:08.110> talked<00:05:08.350> about

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
options we already talked about

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.370 
options we already talked about
different<00:05:08.740> screen<00:05:09.190> options<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:11.020> one<00:05:11.200> thing

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
different screen options so one thing

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.050 
different screen options so one thing
I'll<00:05:11.500> talk<00:05:11.680> about<00:05:11.710> here<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.400> performance

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
I'll talk about here is the performance

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.010 
I'll talk about here is the performance
itself<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.630> pretty<00:05:14.530> much<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.950> par<00:05:14.979> with<00:05:15.550> other

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
itself is pretty much on par with other

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.909 
itself is pretty much on par with other
ultrabooks<00:05:17.020> what<00:05:17.290> you're<00:05:17.380> gonna<00:05:17.500> find<00:05:17.740> though

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
ultrabooks what you're gonna find though

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.700 
ultrabooks what you're gonna find though
is<00:05:17.950> the<00:05:18.190> battery<00:05:18.520> life<00:05:18.700> is<00:05:19.000> worst<00:05:19.780> in<00:05:20.020> class<00:05:20.320> so

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
is the battery life is worst in class so

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.560 
is the battery life is worst in class so
lenovo<00:05:21.220> claims<00:05:21.490> actually<00:05:21.700> up<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.180> eight<00:05:22.300> point

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
lenovo claims actually up to eight point

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.930 
lenovo claims actually up to eight point
six<00:05:22.720> hours<00:05:23.139> which<00:05:23.350> is<00:05:23.470> great<00:05:23.680> in<00:05:23.860> theory<00:05:24.130> but

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
six hours which is great in theory but

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.670 
six hours which is great in theory but
in<00:05:25.000> our<00:05:25.210> tests<00:05:25.630> we<00:05:25.720> got<00:05:25.870> less<00:05:26.110> than<00:05:26.140> six<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.590> a

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
in our tests we got less than six and a

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.650 
in our tests we got less than six and a
half<00:05:26.830> which<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.700> concerning<00:05:28.120> considering

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
half which is concerning considering

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.020 
half which is concerning considering
that<00:05:29.110> there<00:05:29.380> are<00:05:29.590> other<00:05:30.100> ultrabooks<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:30.940> go

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
that there are other ultrabooks that go

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.190 
that there are other ultrabooks that go
into<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> eight<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.570> half<00:05:31.630> nine<00:05:31.960> hour

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
into the eight and a half nine hour

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.950 
into the eight and a half nine hour
range<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.860> even<00:05:32.950> before<00:05:33.760> we<00:05:34.150> tested<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.690> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
range and even before we tested this the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.780 
range and even before we tested this the
shortest<00:05:35.530> running<00:05:35.860> was<00:05:35.979> maybe<00:05:36.190> seven<00:05:36.640> and<00:05:36.760> a

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
shortest running was maybe seven and a

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.279 
shortest running was maybe seven and a
half<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.240> was<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.360> much<00:05:37.539> thinner<00:05:37.840> machine

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
half and it was a much thinner machine

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.330 
half and it was a much thinner machine
this<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:39.430> we're<00:05:39.610> not<00:05:39.700> really<00:05:39.910> sure<00:05:40.000> why<00:05:41.340> this

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
this so we're not really sure why this

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.040 
this so we're not really sure why this
particular<00:05:42.850> machine<00:05:42.970> lasts<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:43.630> little<00:05:43.900> on<00:05:44.020> a

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
particular machine lasts so little on a

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.330 
particular machine lasts so little on a
charge<00:05:44.350> but<00:05:44.620> it's<00:05:44.800> actually<00:05:45.070> one<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.220> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
charge but it's actually one of the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.890 
charge but it's actually one of the
biggest<00:05:45.520> knocks<00:05:45.820> against<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:46.450> think<00:05:46.750> this

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
biggest knocks against it I think this

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.940 
biggest knocks against it I think this
would<00:05:47.050> be<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.200> much<00:05:47.470> more<00:05:47.680> well-rounded

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
would be a much more well-rounded

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.430 
would be a much more well-rounded
machine<00:05:48.610> if<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.630> battery<00:05:49.870> life<00:05:50.080> were<00:05:50.260> better

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
machine if the battery life were better

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.920 
machine if the battery life were better
last<00:05:51.400> thing<00:05:51.700> we're<00:05:52.419> going<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.600> talk<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.780> little

last thing we're going to talk a little

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.950 
last thing we're going to talk a little
bit<00:05:53.110> about<00:05:53.140> software<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:55.210> as<00:05:55.539> you<00:05:55.630> can<00:05:55.780> see

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
bit about software so as you can see

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.719 
bit about software so as you can see
there<00:05:56.110> isn't<00:05:56.229> too<00:05:56.560> much<00:05:56.740> pre-installed<00:05:57.550> you

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
there isn't too much pre-installed you

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
not a bad machine by any respect but I

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.390 
not a bad machine by any respect but I
recommend<00:06:26.320> it<00:06:26.530> much<00:06:26.740> more<00:06:26.950> strongly<00:06:27.250> to

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
recommend it much more strongly to

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.070 
recommend it much more strongly to

are not sold in the lenovo brand per se
it's<00:06:38.810> harder<00:06:39.140> to<00:06:39.260> say<00:06:39.410> why<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.650> would<00:06:39.860> buy

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
it's harder to say why you would buy

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.650 
it's harder to say why you would buy
