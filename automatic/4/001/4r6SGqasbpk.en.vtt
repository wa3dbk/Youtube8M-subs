00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.949 

all<00:00:03.090> right<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.840> be

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
all right this video is going to be

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.860 
all right this video is going to be
about<00:00:04.200> changing<00:00:07.820> I<00:00:08.820> think<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> 10<00:00:09.990> SI

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
about changing I think this is a 10 SI

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.450 
about changing I think this is a 10 SI
alternator<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.790> CS<00:00:14.790> 130<00:00:16.460> alternator

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
alternator to a CS 130 alternator

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810 
alternator to a CS 130 alternator
because<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.330> needed<00:00:18.539> more<00:00:18.720> amperage<00:00:19.490> to<00:00:20.490> run<00:00:20.670> my

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
because I needed more amperage to run my

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.570 
because I needed more amperage to run my
my<00:00:21.300> snowplow<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:23.570> just<00:00:24.570> dimmed<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
my snowplow because it just dimmed the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
my snowplow because it just dimmed the
lights<00:00:26.609> too<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.420> using<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.900> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
lights too much when I was using it and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
lights too much when I was using it and
it<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.439> running<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> battery<00:00:29.099> down<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it was running the battery down and it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.389 
it was running the battery down and it
eventually<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.929> killed<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> alternator<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
eventually it killed the alternator so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.240 
eventually it killed the alternator so
this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> standard<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.500> 57

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this is a standard I think there are 57

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.590 
this is a standard I think there are 57
amps<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.000> don't<00:00:36.840> quote<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.600> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
amps I don't quote me on that but this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.040 
amps I don't quote me on that but this
is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.809> old<00:00:41.000> older<00:00:42.000> tube<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:43.620> plug<00:00:43.860> type<00:00:45.050> they

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is the old older tube to plug type they

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
is the old older tube to plug type they
had<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> V<00:00:46.469> belt<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> this

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
had a V belt on there and this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.160 
had a V belt on there and this
serpentine<00:00:49.640> came<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.910> alternator<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
serpentine came with that alternator and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
serpentine came with that alternator and
I<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.469> switch<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> pulleys<00:00:53.070> over<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I just switch the pulleys over but the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.650 
I just switch the pulleys over but the
reason<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:57.780> making<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.109> video<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:59.670> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
reason why I'm making this video is I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.609 
reason why I'm making this video is I
see<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> confusion<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:01.890> about

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
see a lot of confusion out there about

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.490 
see a lot of confusion out there about
how<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> wire<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.119> you're<00:01:06.500> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
how to wire it up now if you're just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.740 
how to wire it up now if you're just
switching<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.210> 10<00:01:09.210> SI<00:01:09.920> for<00:01:10.920> sts-130<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.510> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
switching out 10 SI for sts-130 you just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
switching out 10 SI for sts-130 you just
need<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> adapter<00:01:13.439> plug<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:14.369> ACDelco<00:01:16.850> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
need this adapter plug from ACDelco this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
need this adapter plug from ACDelco this
is<00:01:18.030> part<00:01:18.299> number

there<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.969> can<00:01:34.090> use<00:01:34.209> that<00:01:34.359> one<00:01:34.539> too<00:01:34.689> but<00:01:35.679> this

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
there you can use that one too but this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.830

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
need the resistor or if you put a light

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.619 
need the resistor or if you put a light
bulb<00:01:58.959> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.479> circuit<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:05.770> light

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:06.629

because the red wire here is for your
sense<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.540> sense<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.019> basically<00:02:14.349> your

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
sense the sense you know basically your

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.819 
sense the sense you know basically your
your<00:02:14.950> voltmeter<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:16.629> yellow<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.440> for

your voltmeter and the yellow one is for

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.900 
your voltmeter and the yellow one is for
your<00:02:18.069> exciter<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:20.579> create<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:21.670> electric

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
your exciter to create the electric

field<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.329> alternator<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.440> let<00:02:24.340> me<00:02:24.400> get

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
field in the alternator but let me get

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:33.470 
field in the alternator but let me get
up<00:02:24.609> I'll<00:02:24.760> show<00:02:24.819> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.920 

this<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:37.010> plugs<00:02:38.010> into<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:39.890> plug<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.130> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
this here plugs into that plug it in and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.890 
this here plugs into that plug it in and
say<00:02:42.930> plug<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.520> already<00:02:44.760> got<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.190 

what<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.020> call<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.780> dielectric

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
what do you call it the dielectric

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.350 
what do you call it the dielectric
grease<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:56.360> let's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
grease on it on this side here let's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.720 
grease on it on this side here let's
push<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.750> into<00:02:57.959> there<00:03:00.260> that's<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
push that into there that's it

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.820 
push that into there that's it
easy<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
easy as that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.380 
easy as that
yeah<00:03:05.280> I'll<00:03:05.400> straighten<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> wiring<00:03:06.030> later

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
yeah I'll straighten up the wiring later

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.680 
yeah I'll straighten up the wiring later
but<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.069> have<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> do<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:12.569> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
but that is all you have to do that is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.650 
but that is all you have to do that is
it<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.830> cost<00:03:14.040> $20<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> adapter<00:03:15.330> would<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
it it cost $20 for the adapter would the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.090 
it it cost $20 for the adapter would the
put<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> resistor<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.799> it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
put the resistor in it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.460 
put the resistor in it
and<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:18.269> was<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.569> one<00:03:18.810> day<00:03:18.959> shipping<00:03:19.319> from

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
and that was with one day shipping from

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.590 
and that was with one day shipping from
amazon<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:20.459> I'll<00:03:20.640> probably<00:03:21.000> put<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.330> link<00:03:21.510> in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
amazon now I'll probably put the link in

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.830 
amazon now I'll probably put the link in
the<00:03:21.690> bottom<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.470> simple<00:03:25.860> as<00:03:26.040> that

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the bottom but it is as simple as that

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.940 
the bottom but it is as simple as that
and<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.019> don't<00:03:28.170> understand<00:03:28.620> why<00:03:28.769> there's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and I just don't understand why there's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.320 
and I just don't understand why there's
so<00:03:29.010> much<00:03:29.130> confusion<00:03:29.370> about<00:03:31.489> how<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.549> transfer

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
so much confusion about how to transfer

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.229 
so much confusion about how to transfer
a<00:03:33.360> CS<00:03:34.160> or<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.310> 10<00:03:36.030> si<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:39.320> CS<00:03:40.320> 130<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:40.920> just

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
a CS or a 10 si to CS 130 it's just

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.640 
a CS or a 10 si to CS 130 it's just
there's<00:03:42.239> no<00:03:42.359> reason<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.959> that's<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
there's no reason for it that's it I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.930 
there's no reason for it that's it I
mean<00:03:43.769> I'm<00:03:44.040> making<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.370> three<00:03:44.549> minute<00:03:44.730> video

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
mean I'm making a three minute video

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.590 
mean I'm making a three minute video
unplugging<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.780> wire<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:49.170> that's<00:03:49.380> it

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
unplugging a wire so so that's it

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.100 

that<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.640> also<00:03:53.820> run<00:03:54.620> an<00:03:55.620> extra<00:03:57.110> wire

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
that is it and I also run an extra wire

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.480 
that is it and I also run an extra wire
straight<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.130> battery<00:03:59.430> I<00:04:01.400> have<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
straight to the battery I have the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.140 
straight to the battery I have the
battery<00:04:02.790> charger<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.360> because<00:04:03.630> uh<00:04:05.150> you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
battery charger on there because uh you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.700 
battery charger on there because uh you
never<00:04:06.420> want<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.930> new<00:04:07.530> alternator<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:10.050> charge<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
never want a new alternator to charge a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.030 
never want a new alternator to charge a
battery<00:04:12.050> you<00:04:13.050> want<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.350> be<00:04:13.440> fully<00:04:13.650> charged

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
battery you want it to be fully charged

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.320 
battery you want it to be fully charged
when<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.250> put<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.430> new<00:04:14.550> alternator

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
when you put a new alternator

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.120 
when you put a new alternator
I<00:04:15.360> also<00:04:16.290> recommend<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.830> new<00:04:16.950> belt<00:04:18.350> but<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.920> is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
I also recommend a new belt but that is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.760 
I also recommend a new belt but that is
it<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.290> hopefully<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.470> helps<00:04:22.650> some<00:04:22.740> people

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
it so hopefully that helps some people

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.300 
it so hopefully that helps some people
out<00:04:23.130> there<00:04:23.510> straighten<00:04:24.510> out<00:04:26.870> their<00:04:27.870> wiring<00:04:28.310> or

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
out there straighten out their wiring or

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.650 
out there straighten out their wiring or
a<00:04:29.790> simple<00:04:30.150> alternator<00:04:31.430> converter<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.270> there

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
a simple alternator converter so there

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.810 
a simple alternator converter so there
you<00:04:33.720> go
