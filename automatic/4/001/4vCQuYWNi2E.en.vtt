00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.220
 again here 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 Today, a hundred can prepare a recipe that besides like me 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 nenÃ© russia I know because with me with this recipe was the first time I had 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.960
 chance to participate 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 with a collaboration with a book edited by fao 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.020
 prepare in it through its sale power 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.320
 percent 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.620
 promote the fight against hunger in Latin America and the Caribbean 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.569
 and so this 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.379
 cd double reason for joy for me in which daddies are treated 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.290
 just cohan 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.340
 xinhua 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 efe efe of grain brian wine so old and big 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 so rich in proteins 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.600
 i a series of that such and more than that and counting 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.989
 but here he did not move to the wound 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.040
 I have another sin, I have to goat 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.850
 If there are mail degrees, once we have withdrawn, we will proceed to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 mix all 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.540
 the potato peta cossiga with its skin by decision of nutritional value and so that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.450
 stay intact let's go to karla a little bit 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 maicon some care 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.370
 and to accompany this and I'm going to prepare a sauce that god is 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.060
 this is so well known in all of America made up of 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.520
 Red pepper 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.690
 boy color that is obtained segÃ³ that tomato green pepper asking for that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.770
 a little support so aligned as if conan salty leporace of lemon olive 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.980
 salt ned and others like for what 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.770
 We can deny him a taste that we like once we are new parents. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.760
 send a little while to the oven just compare the gratin 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069
 and that background cheese and amalgamate 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.370
 in it the quinoa to be able to taste it after 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.010
 with all pleasure and we do not put a saucer I read something to walk and 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.830
 a cooler touch in addition to the eleven that I was on the set then to 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.710
 huetamo the potato and this we can assure it incorporates with good aquino and 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.400
 we have the ingredients quoted mixed quinoa goat cheese 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.420
 remember the well-washed quinoa to get bitter taste boil until 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.599
 be well leg 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.629
 hard game and black verdejo olives that they want chopped with distrust that comes to him 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.219
 well but the idea in this is to take advantage of the intimate potatoes cooked on that website that 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.059
 it was dad who 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.629
 I took it out of the inside, pencil a little bit and add the quinoa to not 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.079
 waste it and if it did not beat another destination 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.739
 I like a little salt and pepper inside the potato and here 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.129
 so 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.929
 pressing a little we reviewed and this we are going to send a touch to the oven 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.259
 so as I said before the innocent cheese is melted to amalgamate a little 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.059
 more effective that is both wants 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.529
 to separate 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.409
 d the potato 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.529
 and on the other hand that mixes the ingredients of the salsa criolla 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.840
 I wish you only 500 the tomato a little garlic and we just will not comment 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.610
 read as if it were a salad with him the CDs come well 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.309
 meshaal pepper a little parsley 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.129
 moore won 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.290
 lemon juice or balsamic vochito vinegar how you like it and the oil 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.859
 also that it suits you 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.180
 here in mendoza 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.660
 we have enough olive oil of very good quality so with this we are going to 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.099
 try 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.969
 good sofas lists 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.319
 more or less people 15 20 minutes in the oven really hot because deliver us 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.339
 we educate is 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.249
 to warm 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:59.079
 and in its absence to gratinar a little more messi that we did but I connect 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:03:59.709

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.879
 more than well let's go to the task, be it I have to prepare one, enable them with a 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.709
