00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.449
 good, we continue with president juan 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.449
 orlando hernandez 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.430
 is it or is it not true this is what 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.480
 I would search 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.030
 additional period I know that in this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 moment there are more important things there 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.080
 an economy that needs to be strengthened 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 there are a lot of unemployed people who have to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 re-employ that there is crime 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.700
 organized that there is homicide I know all 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.660
 those things but those noises affect the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.660
 good governance 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.070
 I would look for a second term president 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.200
 hernandez but first let's establish a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.080
 historical comparison 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.880
 to all the presidents who have 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.010
 come they have been told that they have loved 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.000
 be a few in effect they have 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 dear others not 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 but I think that as I never heard 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 and he talks to him he faces a 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.180
 complex situation but with a lot 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.879
 opportunity my time is dedicated 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 exclusively every morning there 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.220
 matter that it is Saturday Sunday to the subject 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 security 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.990
 then I need to cheer up 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.900
 this town that had fallen by 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.730
 the floors and for that they are not only 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 TV ads I have to go 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.870
 to the field where I am planting 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.220
 I have to go to the factory I have to 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
 it was the neighborhood where the mother is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.710
 desperate I have to take action 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.950
 social in quantities and massively to the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.260
 people I have to also be watching 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.840
 how honduras is respected again 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.760
 internationally I have to see how 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 opposite a relationship with the USA that has 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.860
 been asymmetric in every way 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.110
 much more in respect 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.000
 and I have to be also stimulating 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.320
 to different sectors of entrepreneurs to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.810
 let them trust that we are on the way 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.160
 correct me I have no time 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.580
 You are thinking about the next process 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.850
 electoral and its advisors, either 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.240
 I have them all like that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 Our goal is the theme of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130
 investment 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.689
 to address the issue the safety of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700
 Honduran people the issue of 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.619
 social projects and another issue that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.000
 consumes a lot of time renato and that such 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 once we have not touched it but we should 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 of touching it on the transparency in the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.290
 public administration we have 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.380
 intervened six institutions with one 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.040
 timeline for the change that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.230
 we need one of the first ones is going to be 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.959
 the immigration issue I take advantage of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 end of this month of August I'm going to 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.650
 invite and you will see the new image 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.850
 of immigration at airports and the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.250
 new security model for 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.690
 airports in the middle of this month the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.720
 new security model for areas 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.870
 tourism already starting with roatán la 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.769
 purchase of medicines renato we have 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.530
 saved 300 percent on the purchase of 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.019
 medications take it to hospitals 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.600
 have to go to hospitals as gone 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.519
 to the catarino rivas not only naming 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.010
 the commission but later on a visit 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.610
 surprise I realize that we can 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.040
 flooding medications there but if not 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.150
 we put 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.090
 cleaning and transparency in the handling 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.680
 internal that was drained immediately and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.469
 hospital medicines are coming 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.530
 but we need to get there, that is, 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.079
 so much what I have to do that there is not 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.510
 way of thinking about that and how 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.980
 you say probably as they would say 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.230
 yesterday my people those who are of valdés 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.719
 who are thinking about other things that do 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.989
 if they are speculating there as I would say 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.549
 you but not our purpose is that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.439
 this country go ahead I reborn its 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.410
 purpose are four years presidents 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.390
 four years 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.430
 that is its purpose is not to lengthen the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.800
 period and working now for four 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.140
 years and if I wanted to do is not 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.510
 in my hand the story is to say we are 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.930
 working on this I would rather say that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.610
 who generate that kind of rumors what 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.590
 they want is that we do not succeed in 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.350
 this because then they want the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.300
 opposition is dedicated to thinking about those 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.970
 things that are not on our agenda 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.770
 but that will hinder us but not 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.720
 they are going to stop us in the attempt and in the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.510
 effort of which this country returns to be 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.610
 a safe country , a country respected in the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.220
 world a country with opportunity to 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.130
 investments where the Honduran has 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.320
 opportunities where we continue to support the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.290
 good performance of teachers we go with 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.140
 the educational quality 100 percent of 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.460
 coverage of the students that go from the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.860
 little boys who are in pre age 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.770
 kinder because 65,000 are left out 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.990
 and many are upset because we are 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.240
 bringing the internet to schools and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.250
 also to the main parks and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.310
 someone was saying out there the opposition is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.980
 that you do not eat with clear internet yes 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.410
 that is the tool of the present and 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.200
 the future to be competitive in 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.000
 summarize you on January 27 , 2018 you 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.890
