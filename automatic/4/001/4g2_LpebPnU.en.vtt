00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.620
 I hope you are quite well on the day of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.040
 today because I'm great today 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.530
 I 'm going to show you a tutorial to have 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.190
 free internet this is for the month of 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.820
 July as you will know the joe method 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.100
 freedom 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.869
 I was giving away accounts unfortunately 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.660
 I 'm not going to give accounts anymore because I have 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.870
 a failure with the X generator 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.110
 reasons the first step is this activate 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.960
 the use of data we deactivate the wifi the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.660
 use of data we activate it I remember 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.540
 that it is not necessary to configure a pn in 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.630
 specific to use this 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.310
 this application once installed myself 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.880
 freedom we open it as usual 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.620
 we give you in configure 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.329
 we give you a server connection here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.240
 we put 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.729
 ms 07 point I was don jon freedom point 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 of we can type that connection 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.490
 port 53 settings in none and here everything 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 the rest we leave as is 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.479
 once done all that would be ready 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 to use we are here click on start 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.280
 connection is going to come out of this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.979
 probably if they have android 4.0 4.0 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.120
 from now on we give you to accept and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.620
 we wait 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.620
 the connection is 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 we wait a little 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.280
 It is a somewhat delayed process that is worth 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.990
 Sorry for certain to wait is worth it 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.990
 it will also wait a little 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 ah 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.239
 and the ready has started to generate bits already 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.760
 connect and as we see I'm already connected 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.610
 super fast the suffered lately that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.769
 it works very very very fast here they are 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 seeing the data that is generating me and 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.780
 the key if the typical key is going to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.380
 try them with him with him 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.380

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 let's see if it connects us connected 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 how they saw and super easy super fast 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.880

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.550
 very fast 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.370
