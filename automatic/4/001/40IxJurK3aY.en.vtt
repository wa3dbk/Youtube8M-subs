technology brings that the normal Kindle
OS<00:00:45.629> doesn't<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.739> multitasking<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

home button even though you could do
multitasking<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.039> great<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
multitasking it's not really great it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
multitasking it's not really great it
can't<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.120> hold<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.719> many<00:00:58.020> apps<00:00:58.260> maybe

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
can't really hold that many apps maybe

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
can't really hold that many apps maybe
two<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.640> three<00:00:59.670> at<00:01:00.359> most<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:01.440> Kindle<00:01:01.859> OS

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
two or three at most the Kindle OS

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
two or three at most the Kindle OS
really<00:01:02.550> takes<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> RAM<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.170> doesn't

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really takes a lot of RAM it doesn't

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
really takes a lot of RAM it doesn't
work<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.680> well<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> does<00:01:05.790> work<00:01:06.150> it's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
work that well but it does work it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
work that well but it does work it's
like<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> regular<00:01:07.470> Kindle<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.240> like

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like the regular Kindle so that's like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
like the regular Kindle so that's like
the<00:01:10.170> main<00:01:10.380> feature<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> no

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the main feature there is no

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.969 
the main feature there is no
advertisement<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.080> phone<00:01:13.320> sizes<00:01:13.830> are

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
advertisement all the phone sizes are

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.030 
advertisement all the phone sizes are
smaller<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.270> multi<00:01:15.720> tasking<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
smaller and you get multi tasking so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
smaller and you get multi tasking so
this<00:01:17.369> version<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.970> running<00:01:18.360> seven<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:19.080> four

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this version is running seven point four

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.390 
this version is running seven point four
point<00:01:19.740> six

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
point six

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.690 
point six
there<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.659> Flash<00:01:22.200> Player<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.220> older

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
there is Flash Player but it's an older

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
there is Flash Player but it's an older
model<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.170> does<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:25.950> work<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
model so it does not really work that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.130 
model so it does not really work that
well<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> let's<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.189> play<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> video<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
well so let's just play a video this is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.319 
well so let's just play a video this is
I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> using<00:01:32.189> html5<00:01:32.579> but

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I think this is just using html5 but

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.620 
I think this is just using html5 but
there's<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.170> many<00:01:34.700> website<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.030> can

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
there's not that many website that can

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.469 
there's not that many website that can
use<00:01:37.049> flash<00:01:37.560> player<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.520> older<00:01:38.880> Flash<00:01:39.180> Player

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
use flash player the older Flash Player

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
use flash player the older Flash Player
so<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.500> great<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.490> still

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
so it's not really that great it's still

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
so it's not really that great it's still
a<00:01:41.790> cool<00:01:42.000> feature<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.560> gonna<00:01:43.649> show<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
a cool feature so I'm gonna show you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
a cool feature so I'm gonna show you
what<00:01:44.250> apps<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.759> comes<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> couple<00:01:48.600> apps

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
what apps it comes with so couple apps

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
what apps it comes with so couple apps
that<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.350> comes<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.820> Flash

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that it comes with is right there Flash

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.830 
that it comes with is right there Flash
Player<00:01:51.479> 11<00:01:51.780> point<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.710> add<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.399> add<00:01:53.640> away<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
Player 11 point one add will add away so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.530 
Player 11 point one add will add away so
I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.470> adblock<00:01:56.360> pirate<00:01:57.360> bit

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I think that's like a adblock pirate bit

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.590 
I think that's like a adblock pirate bit
does<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.899> come<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
does not come with it but I think you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.510 
does not come with it but I think you
get<00:02:00.719> Adobe<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.939> get<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.450> normal

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
get Adobe here and you get the normal

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.780 
get Adobe here and you get the normal
normal

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
normal

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.740 
normal
Amazon<00:02:06.750> stuff<00:02:07.110> canalla<00:02:08.009> G<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.459> pre<00:02:08.849> rooted<00:02:09.300> so

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
Amazon stuff canalla G is pre rooted so

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.670 
Amazon stuff canalla G is pre rooted so
you<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.470> super<00:02:11.009> su

you do get super su

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.179 
you do get super su
it<00:02:12.739> comes<00:02:13.129> with<00:02:13.400> Google<00:02:13.939> Play<00:02:14.209> Store<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.769> let's
