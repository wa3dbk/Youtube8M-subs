00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.170
 hi hello how are you today 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.440
 to talk about 2013 the basics and we're going to 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.639
 have and we will transform formally 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.440
 and informal 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.440
 I am chantal and this 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.390
 this is the first place I hope that I 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.300
 before telling them that interest was invented 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.220
 in 1920 for your conscience and whoever believe 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.470
 that was what put it fashionable 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.450
 Beautiful car and casper in the movie 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.830
 ' diamonds breakfast spatial network and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.050
 phoenix that if they have not seen it they are 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.050
 I highly recommend her and she wore a 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.210
 spectacular dress of 16 and this is a 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.559
 option for you as we remember the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.780
 characteristics that these dresses 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.879
 faithful as for example readings the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 Cut dress arrives a bit above 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.140
 the knee or even a little more 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.659
 below we are looking for the dress to be 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.210
 See formal and elegant neckline too 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.640
 it's a discreet neckline although that's not what 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 does not sexy of course that there is 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.810
 very attractive clothes and also 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.570
 we do not know when almost very well and the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.610
 We can not use fabrics very 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 bright we go for not ready as 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.450
 for example this old man I decided to use 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.510
 some shoes with leopard print 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.490
 some high shoes the high shoes we 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.010
 help to gain the centimeters and see us 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.830
 much more is used 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.560
 I'm going 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.020
 projecting a tackled turn is a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 true ideal for the night is a turn 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.160
 It paints and I like very much all 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 vintage accessories and finally my 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.020
 earrings are big earrings call a lot 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 the solution then already quoting 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.320
 rings and bracelets or other things and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.480
 good what do you think if we transform 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.480
 this look for something a little more informal 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 and this is an example of how to use your 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.880
 book black 3 now during the day is 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.130
 exactly the same dress but now 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.020
 I put on a little jacket of beats 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 the jeans jacket that they have 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 you will see amazing a big bag me 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.990
 they like big bags during the day 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.179
 they look very classic and it is also what 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.970
 large enough to fit what 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.450
 want and low shoes to be comfortable 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.400
 to walk a lot alone in shoes 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.080
 Very comfortable low sandals could use 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.100
 the color they want and it would look 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.540
 very nice 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.930
 and what do you think if we leave with the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.930
 second place 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.380
 and this is number two is an option 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.080
 to go dancing or going to a party this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.690
 already strapless dress is shorter 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 he has a little more boys and well I wanted 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.430
 give a touch of color with the shoes 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 purple with our other seniors and the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.290
 funny touch this is my turn a 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.720
 hand bag all masks my 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.880
 accessories I only used one accessory since 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.880
 it is very striking that your jewelry thank you 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.320
 and one of the reasons why I 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.540
 they love dresses like dresses like 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.000
 tops or like legs in this case I'm 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.160
 wearing the dress they just saw as 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 everything is exactly the same dress 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.440
 remember that I had volume then I 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.900
 I put this skirt that also has 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.180
 volume and I decided to also put a 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.760
 this belt without common is black with 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.790
 raise my shoes also changed 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.310
 are same shoes with shoelaces 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 and a patent leather handbag is ideal 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.790
 to use 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.880
 and they will not love me but this is 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.430
 exactly the same dress just that what 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 transform into an option for her good 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.250
 all I did was put a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.630
 Blouse so that I would not see myself very 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.100
 Low-cut the belt is more classic 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.360
 more for the day low shoes italy and 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.460
 my brown bag 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.230
 remember that we can use colors of 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.480
 different bags not strong we have to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.709
 combine us everything looks very good and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.420
 well what do you think we end up 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.420
 defending the pagans etc 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.230
 and before being brought light is much more 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.150
 forward the first ante of all is more 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.120
 more closed formal has a bit of 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.950
 little hand is the coffee you could use 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.500
 Any dress that have a message 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.060
 he looks very elegant decided to use it with a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.990
 pearl necklace is a necklace 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.080
 the mixed works where they left the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.020
 possibility devices and the bag that I made 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.700
 who also used an ideal median 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.700
 for the nights also letters 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.810
 I'm using exactly the same 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.240
 dress they saw lace but now 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.840
 all I did was put on a skirt 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.930
 pencil type our color also I left 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.270
 the shoes and the same bag I removed the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.680
 necklace but I decided to put an accessory 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.680
 extra that my golden ring 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.379
 this is the same coffee dress alone 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.199
 that transforms it into something more casual and 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.179
 with this shirt a white shirt that 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.069

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:15.319

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.449

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.879
 Very well the shoes that live 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.129
 they returned the suicide shoes they know very 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.770
 well and above all this is that they have the 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.020
 tip in different colors my bag 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.029
 big and I'm ready to go to a 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.379
