00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.650
 she is known to everyone as herringbone 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.699
 herringbone because legs before 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.160
 make a push 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.650
 push off ice put like this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 3 position on imagine this 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.019
 visual Christmas tree and he so 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.900
 kids are growing here are our branches and two 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.260
 legs what position do you take before 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.080
 how to push off the ice and so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 stand up our position and jostled once 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.750
 squeeze on the supporting leg sit down and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.790
 jostled 2 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:15.480
 let's repeat rub positions 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:21.660
 handles seven times grew leg brought by 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:24.270
 3 position once we are with you i hope 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.040
 mastered the first and very important 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.160
 figure skating exercise 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.390
 well philistine it is called herringbone 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.610
 more professional main step 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 smoothly having mastered the main step we 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.010
 let's go with you to the next exercise 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.900
 it is inhibition because of course very 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.330
 it is important to pay speed 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.260
 There are a lot of types of brakes. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 braking on ice 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 well let's start with the first one 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.350
 lung in my opinion the kind of braking and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.740
 so pushed let down freedom and duty 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 raid and so we do buzzards 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 braking effect is obtained 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.190
 braking the hall is the easiest and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.590
 ways braking is always everything 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.840
 ask how to brake on the ice here 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.500
 come on now the sound of jerks do it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 one or two and lowered the leg on the ice all of you 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:28.569
 stopped very simple everything is not necessary 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.010
 afraid you just have to try everything 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.830
 stopped 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.940
 pulled all applaud all 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.150
 great you are the king and yes so what 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.610
 see our lessons i hope how 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.610
 minimum mood you will improve 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 but
