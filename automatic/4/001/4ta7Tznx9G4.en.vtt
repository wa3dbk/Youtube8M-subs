00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
uh you you're always taking a little bit

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.270 
uh you you're always taking a little bit
of<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> risk<00:02:24.930> there<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.770> always<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> good<00:02:26.220> idea

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
of a risk there it's always a good idea

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
of a risk there it's always a good idea
to<00:02:26.580> use<00:02:26.910> online<00:02:27.090> Ridge<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.230> one

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
to use online Ridge if you have one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.830 
to use online Ridge if you have one
laying<00:02:28.650> around<00:02:28.860> somewhere<00:02:29.510> because<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.720> you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
laying around somewhere because if you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
laying around somewhere because if you
if<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.410> strip<00:02:31.800> up<00:02:31.980> fitting<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.300> it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
if you strip up fitting that's just it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.320 
if you strip up fitting that's just it's
not<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> good<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.910> can't<00:02:36.090> just

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
not a good thing because you can't just

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.380 
not a good thing because you can't just
the<00:02:36.930> find<00:02:37.590> another<00:02:37.860> nut<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.700> bolt<00:02:38.730> somewhere

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the find another nut or bolt somewhere

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.150 
the find another nut or bolt somewhere
yeah<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.140> can't<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.440> put<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.769> nut<00:02:41.040> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
yeah like you can't just put on nut on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.550 
yeah like you can't just put on nut on
there<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there so if you do have all the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.100 
there so if you do have all the
convenience<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.489> language<00:02:44.940> uh<00:02:45.239> yeah<00:02:45.750> go<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
convenience of a language uh yeah go and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.479 
convenience of a language uh yeah go and
use<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.600> um<00:02:48.709> let's<00:02:49.709> see<00:02:49.890> what's<00:02:50.100> he<00:02:50.220> doing

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
use it so um let's see what's he doing

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.009 
use it so um let's see what's he doing
here<00:02:50.670> ah

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
here ah

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.979 
here ah
it<00:02:52.590> looks<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.190> he's<00:02:53.489> removing<00:02:53.940> ID<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.690> think

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
it looks like he's removing ID I think

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.570 
it looks like he's removing ID I think
you<00:02:55.080> need<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.350> remove<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.769> bleeder<00:02:56.040> valve<00:02:56.130> too

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
you need to remove the bleeder valve too

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.539 
you need to remove the bleeder valve too
if<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:56.850> not<00:02:57.000> mistaken<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:58.380> he<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.890> he

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
if I'm not mistaken I think he just he

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.580 
if I'm not mistaken I think he just he
pulled<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.000> out<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.569> now<00:03:01.410> we're

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
pulled it out there and now we're

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.900 
pulled it out there and now we're
actually<00:03:01.739> looking<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> thing<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
actually looking at the thing and the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
actually looking at the thing and the
boot<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.690> one<00:03:03.870> was<00:03:03.989> tore<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.440> pretty<00:03:04.470> bad
