in<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> talk<00:00:05.250> about

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.509 
in this video we're going to talk about
preserve<00:00:06.210> transparency<00:00:07.220> what<00:00:08.220> does<00:00:08.370> that

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
preserve transparency what does that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.890 
preserve transparency what does that
mean<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.030> little<00:00:09.120> bit<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> geeky

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
mean it's a little bit of a geeky

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.249 
mean it's a little bit of a geeky
sounding<00:00:10.559> title<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:12.120> very<00:00:12.719> important

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
sounding title but it's very important

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
sounding title but it's very important
and<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.769> even<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.549> existing<00:00:14.880> imagery

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
and we can even use the existing imagery

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
and we can even use the existing imagery
that<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.039> able<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> show<00:00:17.490> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
that we have here to be able to show you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420 
that we have here to be able to show you
exactly<00:00:17.820> where<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.600> important<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> last

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
exactly where it's important in the last

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.950 
exactly where it's important in the last
video<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.760> showed<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.119> how<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.539> able<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.840> go

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
video I showed you how I was able to go

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.640 
video I showed you how I was able to go
in<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.170> change<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.550> red<00:00:23.820> character<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.810> this

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
in and change the red character of this

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.120 
in and change the red character of this
element<00:00:26.279> by<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> selecting<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> as

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
element by going in and selecting it as

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
element by going in and selecting it as
a<00:00:29.160> layer<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.760> we've<00:00:30.000> done<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> then<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a layer as we've done here and then I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.069 
a layer as we've done here and then I
went<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:31.920> effect<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.450> used<00:00:33.719> adjust

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
went into effect and I used adjust

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
went into effect and I used adjust
colors<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
colors to do it but what if you want to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
colors to do it but what if you want to
do<00:00:35.850> something<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.180> sophisticated<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:37.260> if

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
do something more sophisticated what if

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.100 
do something more sophisticated what if
you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:37.950> paint<00:00:38.940> strokes<00:00:39.870> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you want to actually paint strokes in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
you want to actually paint strokes in
there<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.559> example<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> add<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
there for example just to add to the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.049 
there for example just to add to the
complexity<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.680> character<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.610> painting

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
complexity or character of the painting

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
complexity or character of the painting
I'd<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.020> somehow<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I'd have to somehow have a way to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.610 
I'd have to somehow have a way to
isolate<00:00:47.360> where<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.570> paint<00:00:48.840> strokes<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.350> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
isolate where my paint strokes are going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.569 
isolate where my paint strokes are going
to<00:00:49.800> go<00:00:49.980> based<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.750> layer<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:53.280> fact

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to go based on this layer and in fact

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
to go based on this layer and in fact
you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.449> preserve<00:00:55.320> transparency<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can do that preserve transparency is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
you can do that preserve transparency is
the<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.590> right<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the way to do that if I go right here in

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
the way to do that if I go right here in
the<00:00:59.910> layers<00:01:00.090> palette<00:01:00.390> you'll<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.809> there's<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the layers palette you'll see there's a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
the layers palette you'll see there's a
little<00:01:01.230> icon<00:01:01.559> preserve<00:01:02.250> transparency<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:03.449> i

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
little icon preserve transparency when i

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.820 
little icon preserve transparency when i
click<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:05.900> disables<00:01:06.900> painter<00:01:07.560> from

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
click that it disables painter from

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
click that it disables painter from
being<00:01:08.010> able<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> apply<00:01:09.299> color<00:01:09.720> anywhere<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
being able to apply color anywhere that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
being able to apply color anywhere that
the<00:01:11.010> layer<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> transparent<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> only

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the layer is transparent and the only

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
the layer is transparent and the only
place<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.100> transparent<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.000> where<00:01:15.299> I've

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
place it's not transparent is where I've

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
place it's not transparent is where I've
painted<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> red<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.729> sure<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
painted the red let's make sure we're on

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
painted the red let's make sure we're on
that<00:01:18.360> layer<00:01:18.680> that's<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.890> only<00:01:20.159> place<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that layer that's the only place that I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
that layer that's the only place that I
have<00:01:21.030> painted<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.509> anywhere<00:01:21.960> else<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have painted so anywhere else is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
have painted so anywhere else is
transparent<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.330> we've<00:01:24.509> got

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
transparent and because we've got

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.100 
transparent and because we've got
preserve<00:01:25.710> transparency<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.780> no<00:01:27.869> longer

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
preserve transparency on I can no longer

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
preserve transparency on I can no longer
paint<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.670> let's<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.780> slightly

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
paint there so let's get a slightly

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
paint there so let's get a slightly
different<00:01:31.530> color<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> might<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
different color that I might want to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.050 
different color that I might want to
paint<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.960> brush<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.060> you'll

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
paint in there with my brush and you'll

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
paint in there with my brush and you'll
see<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.689> appears<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> can't<00:01:37.740> paint

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
see it appears as if I can't paint

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.330 
see it appears as if I can't paint
anywhere<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.210> paint<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.720> here

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
anywhere but I can paint in here

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
anywhere but I can paint in here
sometimes<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.430> refer<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.329> poor

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
sometimes like refer to this as a poor

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.069 
sometimes like refer to this as a poor
man's<00:01:43.049> mask<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.220> gives<00:01:44.520> me<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> ability<00:01:45.079> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
man's mask this gives me the ability to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
man's mask this gives me the ability to
actually<00:01:47.060> use<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.799> layers<00:01:50.060> transparency<00:01:51.060> as

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
actually use the layers transparency as

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
actually use the layers transparency as
a<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> lock<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.979> once<00:01:53.189> I've

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
a way to lock it off and then once I've

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.060 
a way to lock it off and then once I've
done<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.380> start

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
done that I can now go in here and start

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.819 
done that I can now go in here and start
to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.640> things<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.869> would<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.290> difficult<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to do things that would be difficult to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
to do things that would be difficult to
do<00:01:59.009> any<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.939> suppose<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.719> could<00:02:00.990> use

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
do any other way I suppose you could use

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.069 
do any other way I suppose you could use
the<00:02:02.130> layer<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.850> somehow<00:02:03.240> create<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> selection

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the layer to somehow create a selection

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
the layer to somehow create a selection
based<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.119> long<00:02:06.420> way

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
based on that but it's just the long way

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.719 
based on that but it's just the long way
around<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.489> little

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
around where is here this one little

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.170 
around where is here this one little
button<00:02:09.060> allows<00:02:10.020> me<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:11.069> isolate<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.910> layer

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
button allows me to isolate a layer

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.730 
button allows me to isolate a layer
while<00:02:12.780> I'm<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> brush<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
while I'm in the brush and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
while I'm in the brush and
this<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.250> time<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> show<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.090> if

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
this is a good time to show you this if

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.030 
this is a good time to show you this if
I'm<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.870> brush<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.500> hold<00:02:16.770> down<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
I'm in the brush and I hold down the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.730 
I'm in the brush and I hold down the
control<00:02:17.460> key<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:18.240> temporarily<00:02:18.660> switches<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
control key it temporarily switches to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.010 
control key it temporarily switches to
the<00:02:19.770> layer<00:02:20.010> gesture<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:21.390> click

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the layer gesture so I can just click

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.960 
the layer gesture so I can just click
now<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.070> changed<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
now and you can see it just changed to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540 
now and you can see it just changed to
activating<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> blue<00:02:25.110> channel<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> let<00:02:26.400> up

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
activating the blue channel now I let up

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.430 
activating the blue channel now I let up

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
and now I can paint again but unlike

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.830

let's<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> different<00:03:12.030> shade<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.420> green<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
let's get a different shade of green to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.950 
let's get a different shade of green to
paint<00:03:13.080> with<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.210> little<00:03:15.390> more<00:03:15.450> settled<00:03:15.690> in

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960

this<00:03:16.110> case<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:17.220> do<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.700> watch<00:03:17.880> out<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
this case you do have to watch out it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.410 
this case you do have to watch out it
will<00:03:18.600> tend<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.500> want<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.800> drag<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.970> color

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
will tend to want to drag out a color

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.290 
will tend to want to drag out a color
outside<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:23.100> true<00:03:23.490> of<00:03:23.730> every

brush this happens to be one and it's

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.850 
brush this happens to be one and it's
probably<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:27.030> good<00:03:27.450> case<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.870> show<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.650> if

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
probably a good case to show you that if

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.850 
probably a good case to show you that if
you<00:03:28.980> dragged<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.880> some<00:03:30.600> protected<00:03:31.440> areas

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
you dragged in to some protected areas

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.320 
you dragged in to some protected areas

I<00:03:36.060> get<00:03:36.360> around<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.990> make<00:03:37.320> sure<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.560> paint

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
I get around it I just make sure I paint

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.130 
I get around it I just make sure I paint
outward<00:03:38.460> rather<00:03:38.730> than<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.360> from<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> edge<00:03:39.960> and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
outward rather than in from the edge and

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.750 
outward rather than in from the edge and
that's<00:03:40.290> how<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> can<00:03:40.770> get<00:03:41.280> around<00:03:41.520> that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that's how you can get around that

that's how you can get around that
little<00:03:41.940> hiccup<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.630> may<00:03:43.080> happen<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.340> let's

do another one let's go to the yellow
and<00:03:46.710> I'll<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:47.670> kind<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:47.940> an<00:03:48.060> orange<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.870> we'll

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and I'll get kind of an orange and we'll

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.210 
and I'll get kind of an orange and we'll
do<00:03:50.100> some<00:03:50.340> painting<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.630> here<00:03:52.080> but<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:52.890> can<00:03:53.040> see

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
do some painting in here but you can see

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.300 
do some painting in here but you can see
how<00:03:53.370> adding<00:03:54.120> more<00:03:54.870> strokes<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.740> here<00:03:55.950> starts

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
how adding more strokes in here starts

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
how adding more strokes in here starts
to<00:03:56.490> build<00:03:56.880> up<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.180> character<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.230> image

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
to build up the character of this image

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.860 
to build up the character of this image
I<00:03:58.710> can<00:03:58.920> see<00:03:59.070> purple<00:03:59.340> needs<00:03:59.700> another<00:04:00.000> little

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
I can see purple needs another little

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.100 
I can see purple needs another little
hitting<00:04:01.080> or<00:04:01.230> maybe<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.500> little<00:04:01.620> bit<00:04:01.830> darker

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
hitting or maybe a little bit darker

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.930 
hitting or maybe a little bit darker
purple<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.380> I'll<00:04:04.740> just<00:04:04.800> draw<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.460> here<00:04:05.790> maybe

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
purple so I'll just draw in here maybe

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.250 
purple so I'll just draw in here maybe
it<00:04:06.120> needs<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:07.050> more<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:10.020> fact

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
it needs to be a little bit more in fact

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.630 
it needs to be a little bit more in fact
another<00:04:10.560> thing<00:04:10.800> we<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.459> it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
another thing we could do with this it's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.300 
another thing we could do with this it's
kind<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:11.940> fun<00:04:12.180> I'll<00:04:12.690> select<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.470> yellow<00:04:14.040> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
kind of fun I'll select the yellow to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.770 
kind of fun I'll select the yellow to
show<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.790> I'm<00:04:15.060> going<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.420> go<00:04:15.540> get<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
show you this I'm going to go get the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.580 
show you this I'm going to go get the
airbrush<00:04:17.930> we'll<00:04:18.930> just<00:04:19.140> use<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.410> digital

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
airbrush we'll just use the digital

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.860 
airbrush we'll just use the digital
airbrush<00:04:20.130> here<00:04:20.400> what<00:04:21.090> will<00:04:21.270> probably<00:04:21.720> work

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
airbrush here what will probably work

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.690 
airbrush here what will probably work
here<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.460> another

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
here is if I and this is another

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.260 
here is if I and this is another
important<00:04:24.419> q<00:04:24.840> for<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.590> when<00:04:25.950> you're<00:04:26.100> in

important q for you all when you're in

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.210 
important q for you all when you're in
the<00:04:27.629> brush<00:04:27.870> tool<00:04:28.110> if<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.740> hold<00:04:28.949> down<00:04:29.009> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
the brush tool if you hold down the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.749 
the brush tool if you hold down the
option<00:04:29.250> or<00:04:29.849> Alt<00:04:30.090> key<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.780> changes<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.889> the

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
option or Alt key it changes it to the

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.330 
option or Alt key it changes it to the
eyedropper<00:04:33.569> tool<00:04:33.599> so<00:04:34.379> in<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.770> case<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.160> want

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
eyedropper tool so in this case I want

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.369 
eyedropper tool so in this case I want
to<00:04:35.430> use<00:04:35.610> yellow<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.750> want<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.080> be<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.199> little

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
to use yellow but I want to be a little

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.710 
to use yellow but I want to be a little
darker<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:37.949> I've<00:04:38.069> selected<00:04:38.569> basically<00:04:39.569> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
darker so I've selected basically the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240 
darker so I've selected basically the
yellow<00:04:39.960> that's<00:04:40.229> being<00:04:40.409> used<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:41.039> area

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
yellow that's being used in that area

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.550 
yellow that's being used in that area
and<00:04:41.669> i'm<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.240> darken<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.289> down<00:04:43.530> a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
and i'm just going to darken it down a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.670 
and i'm just going to darken it down a
bit<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.039> I've<00:04:44.430> got<00:04:44.639> my<00:04:44.819> digital<00:04:45.210> airbrush<00:04:45.780> so

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
bit and I've got my digital airbrush so

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.129 
bit and I've got my digital airbrush so
what<00:04:46.949> this<00:04:47.069> lets<00:04:47.340> me<00:04:47.400> do<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:48.599> I'm<00:04:48.930> going<00:04:49.110> to

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
what this lets me do and I'm going to

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.010 
what this lets me do and I'm going to
make<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.440> much<00:04:49.949> smaller<00:04:50.430> here<00:04:50.819> let's<00:04:51.060> more

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
make it much smaller here let's more

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.610 
make it much smaller here let's more
like<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:53.750> can<00:04:54.750> go<00:04:54.870> in<00:04:54.930> here<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.139> kind<00:04:55.560> of

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
like that I can go in here and kind of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.950 
like that I can go in here and kind of
again<00:04:56.580> because<00:04:56.849> this<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.120> sort<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.509> a<00:04:57.629> poor

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
again because this is sort of a poor

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.550 
again because this is sort of a poor
man's<00:04:58.229> mask<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:59.069> can<00:04:59.880> give<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> bit<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.440> a

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
man's mask I can give a bit of a

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.469 
man's mask I can give a bit of a
three-dimensional<00:05:01.919> illusion<00:05:02.909> to<00:05:03.030> this<00:05:03.210> just

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
three-dimensional illusion to this just

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.629 
three-dimensional illusion to this just
by<00:05:03.630> painting<00:05:04.620> in<00:05:04.770> here<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.039> there<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.430> go

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
by painting in here and there if I go

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.670 
by painting in here and there if I go
very<00:05:05.940> close<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.509> white<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.840> can<00:05:07.229> kind<00:05:07.409> of<00:05:07.440> put<00:05:07.650> a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
very close to white I can kind of put a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.029 
very close to white I can kind of put a
highlight<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:08.690> this<00:05:09.690> other<00:05:09.900> edge<00:05:10.229> so<00:05:10.530> this<00:05:10.889> is

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
highlight on this other edge so this is

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.559 
highlight on this other edge so this is
yet<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.250> just<00:05:11.520> another<00:05:11.880> way<00:05:12.090> you<00:05:12.150> can<00:05:12.389> take

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
yet a just another way you can take

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.939 
yet a just another way you can take
advantage<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:14.419> preserve<00:05:15.419> transparency<00:05:15.919> so<00:05:16.919> I

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
advantage of preserve transparency so I

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.559 
advantage of preserve transparency so I
said<00:05:17.130> if<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.310> just<00:05:17.490> think<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.849> it<00:05:17.970> literally

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
said if you just think of it literally

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.800 
said if you just think of it literally
as<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.690> form<00:05:19.199> of<00:05:19.319> a<00:05:19.440> mask<00:05:19.740> that's<00:05:20.370> exactly<00:05:20.969> what

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
as a form of a mask that's exactly what

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.779 
as a form of a mask that's exactly what
it's<00:05:21.960> doing<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.680> lets<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.039> do<00:05:23.520> things

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
it's doing and it lets you do things

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.279 
it's doing and it lets you do things
like<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.270> would<00:05:24.509> be<00:05:24.659> otherwise<00:05:24.900> kind

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
like this that would be otherwise kind

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.339 
like this that would be otherwise kind
of<00:05:25.349> difficult<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.860> isolate<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.659> would

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
of difficult to isolate so I would

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.360 
of difficult to isolate so I would
imagine<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.919> if<00:05:29.520> preserve<00:05:30.389> transparency

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
imagine that if preserve transparency

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.490 
imagine that if preserve transparency
was<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.400> police<00:05:33.000> department<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.199> side<00:05:34.469> of

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
was a police department on the side of

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.890 
was a police department on the side of
the<00:05:34.770> police<00:05:35.009> cars<00:05:35.340> would<00:05:36.060> be<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.360> inscription

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the police cars would be the inscription

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.389 
the police cars would be the inscription
to<00:05:37.680> preserve<00:05:38.159> and<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:39.210> protect
