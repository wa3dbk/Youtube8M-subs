now it works fine I'm probably creating

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.280 
now it works fine I'm probably creating
a<00:00:10.440> lot<00:00:10.590> more<00:00:10.769> work<00:00:10.980> than<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.400> need<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.049> by<00:00:13.049> taking

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
a lot more work than I need to by taking

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.870 
a lot more work than I need to by taking
this<00:00:13.559> out<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.920> converting<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> three<00:00:14.670> mix

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000

but I'm just I would be much more
relaxed<00:00:18.690> whenever<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.680> oil<00:00:19.710> mixed<00:00:20.369> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
relaxed whenever I have the oil mixed in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
relaxed whenever I have the oil mixed in
the<00:00:20.580> oil<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> end<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> gas<00:00:21.630> already

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

the oil of the end of the gas already
just<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> yeah<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.600> costs<00:00:24.960> us<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
just like that one is yeah it costs us a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
just like that one is yeah it costs us a
little<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.529> money<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.340> peace<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
reservoir I checked my reads and there
is<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.690> Nick<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> reeds<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.190> like

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is not a Nick on the reeds it's like

this<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.969> engine<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.780> mean<00:00:43.410> damn<00:00:43.590> near<00:00:43.800> New

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the bad thing is is that guy just let it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.690 
the bad thing is is that guy just let it
sit<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.620> while<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.280> needs<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> lot

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

to<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.759> error<00:02:00.210> message<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to see an error message up on the the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.910 
to see an error message up on the the
MFD<00:02:01.860> it'll<00:02:02.310> say<00:02:02.460> low<00:02:02.670> oil<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> take<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> two

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
MFD it'll say low oil you take the two

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.469 
MFD it'll say low oil you take the two
lines<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.430> twist<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.850> together<00:02:05.969> sod

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
lines and you twist them together sod

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
lines and you twist them together sod
room<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:07.079> heat<00:02:07.229> shrink<00:02:07.469> around<00:02:07.740> them

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
room then I put heat shrink around them

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
room then I put heat shrink around them
what<00:02:08.369> that'll<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.789> it'll<00:02:08.940> tell<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.690> thing

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
what that'll do is it'll tell this thing

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.559 
what that'll do is it'll tell this thing
that<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.170> always<00:02:10.530> full

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
that it's always full

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.050 
that it's always full
in<00:02:11.629> FD<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:12.349> here<00:02:12.799> which<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.489> what<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.819> want

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
in FD up here which is what you want

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
in FD up here which is what you want
because<00:02:14.269> you're<00:02:14.569> eliminating<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.140> oil<00:02:15.290> tank

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
because you're eliminating the oil tank

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.830 
because you're eliminating the oil tank
so<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.909> that<00:02:16.969> being<00:02:17.180> said<00:02:17.269> I'm<00:02:17.569> just<00:02:17.599> going

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so with that being said I'm just going

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.629 
so with that being said I'm just going
to<00:02:17.870> tuck<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.200> away<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.650> then<00:02:19.249> you<00:02:19.370> need<00:02:19.549> to

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
to tuck it away and then you need to

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.479 
to tuck it away and then you need to
find<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:20.030> place<00:02:20.060> for<00:02:21.019> your<00:02:21.439> spring<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.950> go<00:02:22.099> well

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
find a place for your spring to go well

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.059 
find a place for your spring to go well
it<00:02:23.329> actually<00:02:23.569> fits<00:02:24.019> nice<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.409> perfectly

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
it actually fits nice and perfectly

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.429 
it actually fits nice and perfectly
right<00:02:25.730> there<00:02:25.969> that's<00:02:26.749> what<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.139> done<00:02:27.290> on

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
right there that's what I have done on

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.470 
right there that's what I have done on
that<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:27.769> on<00:02:27.889> the<00:02:28.010> other<00:02:28.159> side<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.209> what<00:02:29.389> you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
that one on the other side so what you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.610 
that one on the other side so what you
do<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.629> you<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:30.730> wrap<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.760> through<00:02:32.090> there<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
do is you just wrap it through there and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.949 
do is you just wrap it through there and
now<00:02:33.920> you've<00:02:34.430> got<00:02:34.639> your<00:02:34.670> spring<00:02:35.120> now<00:02:35.569> working

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
now you've got your spring now working

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.520 
now you've got your spring now working
and<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.010> whenever<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.400> put<00:02:37.579> your<00:02:37.790> your<00:02:38.750> your

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and then whenever you put your your your

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.309 
and then whenever you put your your your
what<00:02:40.129> you<00:02:40.219> call<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.989> storage<00:02:41.989> thing<00:02:42.169> back

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
what you call it the storage thing back

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.599 
what you call it the storage thing back
in<00:02:42.349> there<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:42.889> kind<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.159> tucked<00:02:43.370> back<00:02:43.549> in

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
in there it just kind of tucked back in

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.839 
in there it just kind of tucked back in
there<00:02:43.879> works<00:02:44.689> pretty<00:02:44.870> nicely<00:02:45.609> not<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.639> huge

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
there works pretty nicely not a huge

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.929 
there works pretty nicely not a huge
deal<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.680> probably<00:02:49.069> put<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.579> somewhere<00:02:49.790> else

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
deal you probably put it somewhere else

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.899 
deal you probably put it somewhere else
down<00:02:50.329> there<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.949> good<00:02:52.129> for<00:02:52.159> now<00:02:52.430> then

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
down there but this is good for now then

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.970 
down there but this is good for now then
that<00:02:53.030> way<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.209> retain<00:02:53.659> your<00:02:53.689> your<00:02:54.620> spring

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
that way you retain your your spring

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.709 
that way you retain your your spring
action<00:02:55.189> whenever<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.969> look<00:02:56.269> at<00:02:56.329> their<00:02:56.480> pulled

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
action whenever I look at their pulled

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.860 
action whenever I look at their pulled
off<00:02:56.870> haha<00:02:57.769> well<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.969> think<00:02:59.090> I'll<00:02:59.329> wrap<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.689> one

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
off haha well I think I'll wrap that one

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.539 
off haha well I think I'll wrap that one
around<00:03:00.109> so<00:03:00.469> i'll<00:03:00.560> have<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.799> read<00:03:01.099> bend<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.489> a

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
around so i'll have to read bend this a

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.220 
around so i'll have to read bend this a
little<00:03:01.730> bit<00:03:01.939> make<00:03:02.689> it<00:03:02.750> work<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> little<00:03:03.109> bit

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
little bit make it work a little bit

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.879 
little bit make it work a little bit
better<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:03.739> i'll<00:03:04.609> figure<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.939> out<00:03:05.090> no<00:03:05.599> worries

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
better so i'll figure it out no worries

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.009 
better so i'll figure it out no worries
but<00:03:06.889> i<00:03:07.370> think<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.359> time<00:03:08.389> to<00:03:08.569> take<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> lunch

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.589 
but i think it's time to take a lunch
break<00:03:09.139> I'm<00:03:09.560> tired<00:03:10.359> starting<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.419> get<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> little

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
the little jumpers ago between the carbs

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.679 
the little jumpers ago between the carbs
our<00:03:33.220> tempo<00:03:34.220> or<00:03:34.519> tambo<00:03:34.970> however<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.479> say<00:03:35.659> it

our tempo or tambo however you say it
the<00:03:36.349> gray<00:03:36.680> garbage<00:03:37.310> line<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:38.030> i<00:03:38.269> will<00:03:39.079> be

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the gray garbage line so i will be

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.420 
the gray garbage line so i will be
running<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.819> in<00:03:41.269> between<00:03:41.629> these<00:03:42.430> carbs

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
running that in between these carbs

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.210 
running that in between these carbs
there<00:03:43.879> or<00:03:44.870> doing<00:03:45.379> a<00:03:45.439> block<00:03:45.650> off<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:46.009> don't<00:03:46.069> know

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
dry and all these are wet so that tells

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.369 
dry and all these are wet so that tells
me<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.680> we<00:04:06.739> may<00:04:06.889> have<00:04:07.009> a<00:04:07.040> passage<00:04:08.049> in<00:04:09.049> the

me that we may have a passage in the

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.670 
me that we may have a passage in the
carburetor<00:04:09.680> clogged<00:04:10.579> up<00:04:10.759> somewhere<00:04:11.180> so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
carburetor clogged up somewhere so

carburetor clogged up somewhere so
that's<00:04:12.680> what's<00:04:13.069> going<00:04:13.250> on<00:04:13.370> right<00:04:13.430> now<00:04:14.379> alright

here's a little word of advice all these

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.319 
here's a little word of advice all these
little<00:04:17.539> screws<00:04:17.979> that<00:04:18.979> are<00:04:19.039> going<00:04:19.370> into<00:04:19.699> you

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
know all these different locations

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.800 
know all these different locations
they're<00:04:22.430> very<00:04:22.669> very<00:04:22.940> soft

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
they're very very soft

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.510

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
they're hard to get out with a standard

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.670 
they're hard to get out with a standard
screwdriver<00:04:25.730> without<00:04:26.300> rounding<00:04:26.510> them<00:04:26.720> off<00:04:26.900> so

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
screwdriver without rounding them off so

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.620 
screwdriver without rounding them off so
what<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> have<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.910> dewalt<00:04:29.450> impact

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
what I have is I have a dewalt impact

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.659 
what I have is I have a dewalt impact
wrench<00:04:30.290> I<00:04:30.530> know<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.860> looks<00:04:30.919> like<00:04:31.130> killing<00:04:31.580> an

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
wrench I know this looks like killing an

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.390 
wrench I know this looks like killing an
amp<00:04:31.790> with<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.030> nuclear<00:04:32.389> weapon<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.889> has<00:04:34.100> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
amp with a nuclear weapon but it has a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.490 
amp with a nuclear weapon but it has a
number<00:04:34.760> two<00:04:35.030> bit<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:35.600> fits<00:04:35.810> perfectly<00:04:36.290> in

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
number two bit that fits perfectly in

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.110 
number two bit that fits perfectly in
there<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:36.889> then<00:04:37.040> all<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.400> do<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.090> just

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
there and then all you do is you just

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.280 
there and then all you do is you just
just<00:04:39.080> barely<00:04:39.470> bump<00:04:40.100> it<00:04:40.250> just<00:04:41.000> one<00:04:41.300> time<00:04:41.330> and

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
just barely bump it just one time and

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.110 
just barely bump it just one time and
then<00:04:43.010> what<00:04:43.190> happens<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:44.060> will<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:46.030> pumps<00:04:47.030> it

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
then what happens is it will it pumps it

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.520 
then what happens is it will it pumps it
loose<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:47.889> therefore<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:49.010> don't<00:04:49.190> get<00:04:50.530> now

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
loose so therefore you don't get now

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.230 
loose so therefore you don't get now
that<00:04:51.710> one<00:04:51.830> wasn't<00:04:52.010> very<00:04:52.220> tight<00:04:52.460> see<00:04:53.060> if<00:04:53.150> this

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
that one wasn't very tight see if this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.440 
that one wasn't very tight see if this
one<00:04:53.450> does<00:04:54.370> yep<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.700> hear<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.000> click<00:04:56.120> once

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
one does yep so you hear it click once

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.850 
one does yep so you hear it click once
and<00:04:56.660> that<00:04:56.840> just<00:04:57.020> breaks<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.410> loose<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.710> don't

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
and that just breaks it loose you don't

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.210 
and that just breaks it loose you don't
just<00:04:58.040> break<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.180> on<00:04:59.270> out<00:04:59.450> from<00:04:59.630> there<00:04:59.780> but<00:05:00.220> yeah

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
just break it on out from there but yeah

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.540 
just break it on out from there but yeah
so<00:05:01.970> therefore<00:05:02.389> that'll<00:05:03.139> help<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.590> get<00:05:04.340> those

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
so therefore that'll help you get those

so therefore that'll help you get those
things<00:05:04.760> out<00:05:04.940> if<00:05:05.090> you've<00:05:05.240> got<00:05:05.419> one<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.660> those

things out if you've got one of those

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.240 
things out if you've got one of those
impact<00:05:06.200> wrenches<00:05:06.500> that<00:05:06.680> just<00:05:06.860> helps<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.220> ton

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
impact wrenches that just helps a ton

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.159 
impact wrenches that just helps a ton
and<00:05:07.700> getting<00:05:08.210> those<00:05:08.330> screws<00:05:08.660> out<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:08.990> back

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
and getting those screws out on the back

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.530 
and getting those screws out on the back
it<00:05:09.350> really<00:05:09.440> helped<00:05:09.800> too<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:10.850> don't<00:05:11.300> put<00:05:11.479> them

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
it really helped too I don't put them

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.969 
it really helped too I don't put them
back<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:11.900> with<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:12.200> but<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.710> know<00:05:12.800> at<00:05:12.919> least

back in with that but you know at least

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.409 
back in with that but you know at least
it<00:05:13.220> gets<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.520> gets<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.360> don't

I sprayed my value craft carb cleaner
down<00:05:36.140> inside<00:05:36.560> every<00:05:36.890> single<00:05:37.220> hole<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.669> I

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
down inside every single hole and I

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.570 
down inside every single hole and I
think<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:39.050> found<00:05:39.229> out<00:05:39.410> why<00:05:39.590> this<00:05:39.650> one<00:05:40.039> was<00:05:40.250> dry

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
think I found out why this one was dry

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.540 
think I found out why this one was dry
is<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.570> had<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.780> blockage<00:05:42.320> whenever<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.010> opened

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
is I had a blockage whenever this opened

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.210 
is I had a blockage whenever this opened
this<00:05:44.240> jet<00:05:44.840> right<00:05:45.320> down<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.620> there<00:05:45.800> was<00:05:46.039> not

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
this jet right down in there was not

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.380 
this jet right down in there was not
allowing<00:05:46.640> fueled<00:05:46.970> in<00:05:47.120> there<00:05:47.270> because

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
allowing fueled in there because

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.210 
allowing fueled in there because
whenever<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.020> sprayed<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.530> carb<00:05:48.770> cleaner<00:05:49.010> in

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
whenever I sprayed the carb cleaner in

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.340 
whenever I sprayed the carb cleaner in
there<00:05:49.370> right<00:05:49.550> there<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:50.450> just<00:05:50.720> pulled<00:05:50.960> up<00:05:51.169> it

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
there right there it just pulled up it

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.590 
there right there it just pulled up it
did<00:05:51.500> not<00:05:51.620> come<00:05:51.830> out<00:05:51.979> once<00:05:52.580> I<00:05:52.700> blew<00:05:53.030> it<00:05:53.180> out<00:05:53.330> and

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
did not come out once I blew it out and

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.240 
did not come out once I blew it out and
it<00:05:53.690> came<00:05:53.840> out<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.200> fuel<00:05:54.440> inlet<00:05:54.770> that's<00:05:55.010> it

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
it came out the fuel inlet that's it

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.250 
it came out the fuel inlet that's it
would<00:05:55.400> start<00:05:55.580> draining<00:05:55.880> so<00:05:56.300> I<00:05:56.510> think<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.110> may

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
would start draining so I think that may

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.379 
would start draining so I think that may
have<00:05:57.289> been<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.530> issue<00:05:57.710> but<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.460> did<00:05:58.760> find<00:05:59.030> some

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
have been the issue but I did find some

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.080 
have been the issue but I did find some

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
three so I didn't take him back out it

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.779 
three so I didn't take him back out it
was<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.590> learning<00:06:15.740> experience<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:16.490> be<00:06:16.580> able<00:06:16.639> to

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
was a learning experience to be able to

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:17.950 
was a learning experience to be able to
take<00:06:16.910> them<00:06:17.090> apart<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.510> see<00:06:17.690> what<00:06:17.810> they<00:06:17.930> are

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
take them apart and see what they are

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.659 
take them apart and see what they are
and<00:06:18.200> clean<00:06:18.410> them<00:06:18.530> up<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.860> really<00:06:19.370> don't<00:06:19.580> think

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
and clean them up I really don't think

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.879 
and clean them up I really don't think
they<00:06:20.000> need<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.240> do<00:06:20.360> it<00:06:20.479> but<00:06:20.810> or<00:06:21.110> be<00:06:21.289> rebuilt<00:06:21.680> but

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
they need to do it but or be rebuilt but

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.080 
they need to do it but or be rebuilt but
since<00:06:22.160> I'm<00:06:22.310> there<00:06:22.520> I'm<00:06:22.729> going<00:06:22.850> to<00:06:22.940> go<00:06:23.030> ahead

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
since I'm there I'm going to go ahead

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.870 
since I'm there I'm going to go ahead
and<00:06:23.210> do<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.979> so<00:06:24.979> I<00:06:25.010> think<00:06:25.130> that's<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:25.550> for<00:06:25.760> now

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
and do it so I think that's it for now

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.010 
and do it so I think that's it for now
until<00:06:26.780> I<00:06:26.840> get<00:06:26.990> some<00:06:27.139> parts<00:06:27.320> in<00:06:28.630> I've<00:06:29.630> worked<00:06:29.870> my
