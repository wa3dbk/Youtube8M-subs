00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.700
 a link in the description of the video 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.600
 to download it is what he's going 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.220
 must do before launching 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.140
 the app has plugged your key 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.140
 usb because otherwise it will not work 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.910
 so you plug in your usb key you 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.410
 wait a little time they 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.940
 be detected here and then you 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.070
 can launch the application so we 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.780
 click on wii once the application 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.280
 open to looks like this so 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.630
 in peripheral countries much does it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.070
 is the right USB key that are 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300
 selected and not another one that would 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.640
 plug into your computer 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.260
 in this type of partitions and systems 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.540
 of intended destination it's like these 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.089
 file systems like you have a 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.230
 allocation unit the same in the name 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.030
 volume then you can change it 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.950
 but it's not too serious 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.560
 you can also leave it as 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.120
 it's here in formatting options I 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.220
 will see what the formatting box 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.290
 fast be cochet create a disc of 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.510
 start up and add an extended label and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.550
 an icon so that's if you ever 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.280
 want the name that appears on your 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.140
 volume is the name of the image iso that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.080
 you injected him or else you uncheck 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.660
 you put a custom name here 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.130
 then you go selected image iso 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.720
 you're going to click here to go 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.360
 search your iso image so me 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.140
 it is an iso of windows 10 version 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.820
 beta I select it open but me 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.340
 what I like doing is offbeat 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.460
 rufus and open the lobes like that I 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.830
 see what he's doing here and click 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 on start her says that 's going to clear 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.160
 all the data of the volume you are doing 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.510
 okay alas it remains only to 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.040
 wait until it's over 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.370
 that's it, we're almost at the end of 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.370
 the copy 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.190
 and once rufus has finished 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.890
 the operation you see he did so 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.570
 I go back a case dsk so that's 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.240
 to check if everything is fine on the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.190
 disk and then they test if ever 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.460
 the boot is recognized so there we can 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.960
 see that the boot bootable boot and is 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.380
 what the boot is recognized by the 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.990
 system 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.340
 yes so once rufus has finished 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.010
 you can click close without 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
 no problem and your key is bootable 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.940
 that's all for this video
