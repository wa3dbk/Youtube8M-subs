00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
it's reasonable because remember this is

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.960 
it's reasonable because remember this is
a<00:04:01.570> fan<00:04:01.900> these<00:04:02.440> guys<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.920> making<00:04:03.250> these<00:04:03.400> this

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
a fan these guys are making these this

whole<00:04:04.120> series<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.660> know<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.230> takes<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.500> lot<00:04:05.620> of

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
whole series you know it takes a lot of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.010 
whole series you know it takes a lot of
work<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.980> do<00:04:06.100> all<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.250> stuff<00:04:06.490> so<00:04:06.940> um<00:04:07.209> maybe

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
work to do all that stuff so um maybe

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.180 
work to do all that stuff so um maybe
they'll<00:04:08.320> get<00:04:08.530> into<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.040> next

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
they'll get into that in the next

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.100 
they'll get into that in the next
episode<00:04:09.670> maybe<00:04:09.910> we'll<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.240> more<00:04:10.420> development

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
episode maybe we'll see more development

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.100 
episode maybe we'll see more development
but<00:04:11.950> at<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.090> end<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.390> episode<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.930> looks

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
but at the end of the episode that looks

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.390 
but at the end of the episode that looks
like<00:04:14.230> they're<00:04:14.380> all<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.739> flying<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
like they're all like a flying to the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.740 
like they're all like a flying to the
enemy<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:15.940> don't<00:04:16.120> think<00:04:16.299> we're<00:04:16.419> gonna<00:04:16.510> get

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
enemy so I don't think we're gonna get

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.810 
enemy so I don't think we're gonna get
that<00:04:16.959> maybe<00:04:17.739> they'll<00:04:17.919> do<00:04:18.040> like<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> flashback<00:04:18.489> I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
that maybe they'll do like a flashback I

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.400 
that maybe they'll do like a flashback I
don't<00:04:19.060> know<00:04:19.150> I'm<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.660> know<00:04:19.690> speculating

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
don't know I'm just you know speculating

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.900 
don't know I'm just you know speculating
predicting<00:04:20.919> stuff<00:04:21.100> for<00:04:21.280> next<00:04:21.459> episode<00:04:21.580> but

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
predicting stuff for next episode but

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.310 
predicting stuff for next episode but
looks<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:22.150> they're<00:04:22.720> gonna<00:04:22.840> go<00:04:22.990> right<00:04:23.169> into

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
looks like they're gonna go right into

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.030 
looks like they're gonna go right into
the<00:04:23.440> battle<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.400> next<00:04:24.610> episode

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
the battle in the next episode

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.850 
the battle in the next episode
so<00:04:25.640> like<00:04:25.820> I<00:04:25.970> said<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.390> anything<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.830> only

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
so like I said if anything the only

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.560 
so like I said if anything the only
thing<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.340> didn't<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.790> much<00:04:29.090> was<00:04:29.330> the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
thing I didn't like that much was the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.170 
thing I didn't like that much was the
animation<00:04:30.050> was<00:04:30.080> kind<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.410> off<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.890> but<00:04:31.180> I

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
animation was kind of off and on but I

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.700
