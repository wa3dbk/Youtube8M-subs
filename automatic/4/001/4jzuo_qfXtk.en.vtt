first starter block since they're the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.599 
first starter block since they're the
lightest<00:04:18.260> had<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.500> make<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.739> thing<00:04:18.950> fly

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
lightest had to make this thing fly

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.610 
lightest had to make this thing fly
somehow<00:04:20.030> go<00:04:20.870> check<00:04:21.140> out<00:04:21.260> what's<00:04:21.290> in<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
inside we got to tier1 plasma guns in

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.650 
inside we got to tier1 plasma guns in
the<00:04:23.990> ice<00:04:24.220> got<00:04:25.220> some<00:04:25.400> jet<00:04:25.669> engines<00:04:26.060> should<00:04:26.540> have

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the ice got some jet engines should have

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.420 
the ice got some jet engines should have
four<00:04:26.990> total<00:04:27.230> give<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.890> little<00:04:27.980> bit<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.220> lift

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
four total give it a little bit of lift

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.270

got<00:04:28.850> my<00:04:28.970> pilot's<00:04:29.150> seat<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.780> then<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.590> got<00:04:30.740> four

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
got my pilot's seat and then I got four

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.920 
got my pilot's seat and then I got four
tier<00:04:31.669> to<00:04:32.260> hover<00:04:33.260> engines<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.690> that's<00:04:35.810> what

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
tier to hover engines so that's what

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.500 
tier to hover engines so that's what
keeps<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.290> flowing<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:37.419> surprisingly<00:04:38.419> this

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
keeps it flowing and surprisingly this

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.900 
keeps it flowing and surprisingly this
thing<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.380> uses<00:04:39.590> up<00:04:39.860> quite<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> bit<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> cpu

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
thing is it uses up quite a bit of cpu

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.550 
thing is it uses up quite a bit of cpu
for<00:04:41.120> what<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.450> just<00:04:41.750> barely<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.200> little<00:04:42.440> bit

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
for what it is just barely a little bit

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.830 
for what it is just barely a little bit
of<00:04:42.710> tier<00:04:43.580> 1<00:04:43.790> blocks<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> couple<00:04:44.600> little
