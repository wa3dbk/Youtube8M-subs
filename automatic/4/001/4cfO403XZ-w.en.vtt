00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.570 
made up for it in the field as I was
getting<00:03:40.810> double<00:03:41.320> plays<00:03:41.620> getting<00:03:42.010> guys<00:03:42.280> out

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
getting double plays getting guys out

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.690 
getting double plays getting guys out

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.350 
the first I believe that was the third
out<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:35.280> we<00:05:35.460> get<00:05:35.640> him<00:05:35.760> out<00:05:35.910> right<00:05:36.210> there<00:05:36.510> and

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
out so we get him out right there and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.180 
out so we get him out right there and
now<00:05:39.360> I'm<00:05:39.570> back<00:05:39.780> at<00:05:39.990> bat<00:05:40.230> again<00:05:40.560> top<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
now I'm back at bat again top of the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.370 
now I'm back at bat again top of the
fourth<00:05:41.460> inning<00:05:41.730> now<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.720> this<00:05:42.930> time<00:05:43.200> I'm
