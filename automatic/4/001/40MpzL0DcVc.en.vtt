00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
hello and welcome to the final part of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.100 
hello and welcome to the final part of
the<00:00:09.630> electro<00:00:10.410> star<00:00:10.769> project<00:00:11.400> videos<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.150> this

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
the electro star project videos and this

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.160 
the electro star project videos and this
is<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.400> all<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.330> completion

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
is going to be all about the completion

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
is going to be all about the completion
of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.619> electro<00:00:17.039> star<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.449> know<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
of the electro star now I know at the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870 
of the electro star now I know at the
moment<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.500> front<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
moment in front of you I have the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
moment in front of you I have the
electro<00:00:21.270> star<00:00:21.590> without<00:00:22.590> any<00:00:23.510> livery<00:00:24.650> decals

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
electro star without any livery decals

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.689 
electro star without any livery decals
and<00:00:26.390> that<00:00:27.390> will<00:00:27.779> appear<00:00:28.289> towards<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.310> end<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and that will appear towards the end of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
and that will appear towards the end of
the<00:00:29.970> video<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> completion<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> thought

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the video as a completion but I thought

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.549 
the video as a completion but I thought
I'd<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.910> -<00:00:33.390> segment<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> start<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
I'd do a - segment at the start of this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.840 
I'd do a - segment at the start of this
video<00:00:34.880> which<00:00:35.880> shows<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.809> work<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:38.340> under

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
video which shows the work of the under

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750 
video which shows the work of the under
frame<00:00:39.059> boxes<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.840> equipment<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:41.579> have

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
frame boxes and equipment which have

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.080 
frame boxes and equipment which have
been<00:00:41.910> added<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> each<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> cars<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.090> also

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
been added to each of the cars and also

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
been added to each of the cars and also
I've<00:00:45.329> added<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.500> smaller<00:00:47.129> detail<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I've added the smaller detail to the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.010 
I've added the smaller detail to the
front<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.680> coupling<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> taking<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
front which is the coupling so taking a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.160 
front which is the coupling so taking a
closer<00:00:52.230> view<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.390> electro<00:00:54.390> star<00:00:54.780> from

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
closer view at the electro star from

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.250 
closer view at the electro star from
coach<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.850> under<00:00:57.360> frame<00:00:57.629> equipment

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
coach and the under frame equipment

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
coach and the under frame equipment
boxes<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.980> been<00:00:59.010> added<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.600> have

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
boxes have been added and these have

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.700 
boxes have been added and these have
been<00:01:00.840> kindly<00:01:01.500> supplied<00:01:01.829> by<00:01:02.609> James<00:01:03.149> Mackin<00:01:03.960> for

a small fee and he is the same chap as
you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.610> who<00:01:09.030> did<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.229> electro<00:01:10.979> star<00:01:11.280> cabs

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you know who did the electro star cabs

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.469 
you know who did the electro star cabs
and<00:01:12.150> created<00:01:12.900> his<00:01:13.430> southern<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> first

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and created his southern and first

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
and created his southern and first
capital<00:01:15.869> connect<00:01:16.320> electro<00:01:16.770> stars<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.030> I've

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
capital connect electro stars and I've

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.350 
capital connect electro stars and I've
painted<00:01:18.479> them<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> sort<00:01:20.610> primer<00:01:21.000> color

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
painted them up in a sort primer color

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
painted them up in a sort primer color
and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.170> I've<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.320> weathered<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.070> over

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and then I've just weathered them over

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.920 
and then I've just weathered them over
the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.880> give<00:01:23.909> him<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> sort<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> dirty

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the top to give him that sort of dirty

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.490 
the top to give him that sort of dirty
look<00:01:25.290> underneath<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> only<00:01:27.900> other<00:01:27.990> thing<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
look underneath the only other thing to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.249 
look underneath the only other thing to
add<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.549> said<00:01:29.729> before<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.689> taken<00:01:31.280> the

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
add as I said before is I have taken the

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.030 
add as I said before is I have taken the
downer<00:01:34.259> couplings<00:01:34.829> which<00:01:35.460> were<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
downer couplings which were on the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
downer couplings which were on the
southeastern<00:01:38.040> networker<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.900> may

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
southeastern networker and as you may

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
southeastern networker and as you may
have<00:01:40.079> recalled<00:01:40.680> from<00:01:40.890> previous<00:01:41.340> videos<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
have recalled from previous videos I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
have recalled from previous videos I
have<00:01:42.780> converted<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:44.490> networker<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.850> added<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
have converted the networker and added a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
have converted the networker and added a
coupling<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.079> front<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> can

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
coupling on the front of it so it can

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.340 
coupling on the front of it so it can
couple<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.790> another<00:01:50.970> networker<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:52.020> create

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
couple up to another networker to create

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.670 
couple up to another networker to create
the<00:01:52.439> four<00:01:52.680> car<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:54.299> doing<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the four car and by doing this it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.209 
the four car and by doing this it
obviously<00:01:56.549> released<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.469> couplings

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
obviously released two of the couplings

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.370 
obviously released two of the couplings
on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.759> front<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> networker<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
on the front of the networker which I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
on the front of the networker which I
have<00:02:02.000> reused<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:04.490> electro<00:02:05.490> star<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:05.969> seen

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
have reused on the electro star as seen

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.109 
have reused on the electro star as seen
in<00:02:06.570> front<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> next<00:02:08.610> thing<00:02:08.879> I'm

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
in front of you so the next thing I'm

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
in front of you so the next thing I'm
going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:10.410> away<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.830> complete<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.879> the
