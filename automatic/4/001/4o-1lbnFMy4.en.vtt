00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
what we've done about this is two things

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.080 
what we've done about this is two things
firstly<00:03:32.200> we've<00:03:32.440> made<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.980> ability<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.580> resize

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
firstly we've made the ability to resize

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.960 
firstly we've made the ability to resize
any<00:03:34.450> area<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.440> screen<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.830> lot<00:03:36.130> better<00:03:36.370> so

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
any area on the screen a lot better so

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.060 
any area on the screen a lot better so
for<00:03:37.150> example<00:03:37.660> here<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:38.170> my<00:03:38.320> conversation<00:03:39.040> with

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
for example here in my conversation with

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.720 
for example here in my conversation with
Emma<00:03:39.490> I<00:03:39.850> can<00:03:40.690> take<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> profile<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.980> drag<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.550> up

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
Emma I can take a profile and drag it up

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.480 
Emma I can take a profile and drag it up
and<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.780> resizes<00:03:44.140> quite<00:03:44.560> nicely<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
and it resizes quite nicely and it

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.400 
and it resizes quite nicely and it
creates<00:03:45.820> some<00:03:46.060> more<00:03:46.240> space<00:03:46.690> below<00:03:47.110> where<00:03:47.380> I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
creates some more space below where I

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.390 
creates some more space below where I
can<00:03:47.680> use<00:03:48.190> some<00:03:48.459> instant<00:03:48.790> messaging<00:03:49.209> with<00:03:49.360> her

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
can use some instant messaging with her

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.860 
can use some instant messaging with her
secondly<00:03:51.400> what<00:03:51.790> we've<00:03:51.940> done<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.450> we've<00:03:52.840> made

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
secondly what we've done is we've made

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.610 
secondly what we've done is we've made
an<00:03:53.440> entire<00:03:53.860> new<00:03:54.220> view<00:03:54.580> which<00:03:55.000> we<00:03:55.180> call<00:03:55.620> compact

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
an entire new view which we call compact

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.190 
an entire new view which we call compact
view<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.970> here<00:03:58.209> if<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.450> go<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.990> View

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
view and so here if you go to the View

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.340 
view and so here if you go to the View
menu<00:03:59.400> hit<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.550> compact<00:04:01.120> view<00:04:01.330> what<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.140> does

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
menu hit on compact view what that does

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.830 
menu hit on compact view what that does
is<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.709> separates<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.400> single<00:04:03.850> window<00:04:04.030> into

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
is it separates the single window into

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.410 
is it separates the single window into
two<00:04:05.050> windows<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.100> here<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.490> can<00:04:06.670> see<00:04:06.940> I've

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
two windows and so here you can see I've

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.390 
two windows and so here you can see I've
got<00:04:07.690> my<00:04:07.900> contact<00:04:08.410> list<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:08.980> left-hand

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
got my contact list on the left-hand

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.100 
got my contact list on the left-hand
side<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:10.030> any<00:04:10.450> time<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.750> have<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.050> conversation

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
side and any time I have a conversation

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.560 
side and any time I have a conversation
with<00:04:11.890> someone<00:04:12.160> it'll<00:04:12.850> open<00:04:13.000> up<00:04:13.240> into<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
with someone it'll open up into a

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.750 
with someone it'll open up into a
separate<00:04:13.989> window<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.860> very<00:04:15.070> similar<00:04:15.520> way<00:04:15.730> to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
separate window in a very similar way to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.699 
separate window in a very similar way to
how<00:04:16.090> all<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.570> older<00:04:16.900> versions<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.470> Skype

how all the older versions of Skype

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.010 
how all the older versions of Skype
worked<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.910> let's<00:04:19.090> take<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.299> look<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.690> see<00:04:19.840> what

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
worked so let's take a look and see what

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.740 
worked so let's take a look and see what
a<00:04:20.049> video<00:04:20.230> call<00:04:20.620> looks<00:04:20.890> like<00:04:21.130> inside<00:04:22.120> compact
