and<00:02:46.170> doing<00:02:46.500> their<00:02:46.680> job<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.760> should<00:02:47.940> be

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and doing their job and you should be

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.060 
and doing their job and you should be
the<00:02:48.120> same<00:02:48.330> way<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.350> focused<00:02:49.950> on

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the same way so if you are focused on

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.890 
the same way so if you are focused on
something<00:02:50.280> outside<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.790> yourself<00:02:50.940> it's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
something outside of yourself it's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.150 
something outside of yourself it's
probably<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> skill<00:02:52.680> level<00:02:52.710> isn't

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
probably because the skill level isn't

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.650 
probably because the skill level isn't
high<00:02:53.310> enough<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.970> don't<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.480> focus

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
high enough that you don't have to focus

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420 
high enough that you don't have to focus
on<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> hopefully<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.770> makes<00:02:55.920> sense<00:02:56.070> all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
on that hopefully that makes sense all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.070 
on that hopefully that makes sense all
y'all<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> answer<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
y'all so that's the answer to the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320 
y'all so that's the answer to the
question<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.710> should<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.520> this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
question what should you do if this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.880 
question what should you do if this
