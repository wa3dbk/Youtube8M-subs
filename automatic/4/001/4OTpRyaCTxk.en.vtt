00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.579 
hey guys so today I'm really excited
because<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.799> got<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.850> Rilakkuma<00:00:06.509> aqua<00:00:07.290> beads

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
because I got this Rilakkuma aqua beads

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.620 
because I got this Rilakkuma aqua beads
aren't<00:00:08.130> set<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.360> actually<00:00:09.809> did<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.440> before

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
aren't set I actually did a video before

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
aren't set I actually did a video before
doing<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.990> frozen<00:00:13.679> set<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.400> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
doing the frozen set so this is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.510 
doing the frozen set so this is
basically<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> Japanese<00:00:16.170> version<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.980> think

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
basically the Japanese version I think

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000 
basically the Japanese version I think
they're<00:00:17.699> called<00:00:17.940> Beados<00:00:18.420> here<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.260> America

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they're called Beados here in America

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.010 
they're called Beados here in America
they're<00:00:20.220> basically<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.730> beads<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.869> you

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
they're basically little beads that you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
they're basically little beads that you
can<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:23.010> designs<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.850> then<00:00:23.939> spray<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
can do little designs and then spray it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.490 
can do little designs and then spray it
with<00:00:24.359> water<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.080> fuse<00:00:25.350> together

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
with water and then they fuse together

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.009 
with water and then they fuse together
and<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.460> cool<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.720> doesn't

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and it's really really cool it doesn't

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
and it's really really cool it doesn't
require<00:00:28.140> any<00:00:28.320> heat<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.099> perler<00:00:29.490> beads<00:00:29.699> do

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
require any heat like perler beads do

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
require any heat like perler beads do
and<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.779> excited<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.099> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and I'm really excited I got this on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.049 
and I'm really excited I got this on
Amazon<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.059> believe<00:00:33.500> it<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:35.520> expensive

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
Amazon I believe it was really expensive

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.650 
Amazon I believe it was really expensive
so<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.460> gonna<00:00:38.579> tell<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
don't think they make very many of these

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.810 
don't think they make very many of these
anymore<00:00:42.170> at<00:00:43.170> least<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.760> easily<00:00:44.930> found<00:00:45.930> online

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
anymore at least not easily found online

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
anymore at least not easily found online
but<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.180> excited<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.989> let's<00:00:49.260> just

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.850 
but I'm really excited so let's just
open<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.030> opening<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> box<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.590> ton

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
open it so opening the box you get a ton

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.229 
open it so opening the box you get a ton
of<00:00:53.070> different<00:00:53.370> colored<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:59.239> board

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of different colored you get your board

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.080 
of different colored you get your board
to<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.620> beads<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to put all of the beads on and then you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.340 
to put all of the beads on and then you
get<00:01:03.979> some<00:01:05.479> Souls<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> spray<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.689> water

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
get some Souls you spray them with water

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
get some Souls you spray them with water
and<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:13.950> fuse<00:01:14.340> together<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> really

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and they fuse together which is really

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
and they fuse together which is really
super<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:19.470> holder

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
super and then you get a little holder

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.870 
super and then you get a little holder
for<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:21.409> okay<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.189> most<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
for all of your okay so I put most of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420 
for all of your okay so I put most of
the<00:01:24.060> beads<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.049> all<00:01:25.290> fit<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.040> don't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the beads in here they all fit I don't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130 
the beads in here they all fit I don't
really<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.729> who<00:01:26.970> designed<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.540> tray<00:01:27.869> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
really know who designed this tray but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.069 
really know who designed this tray but
it's<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.860> effective<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.990> don't

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it's not very effective and I don't

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359 
it's not very effective and I don't
think<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:31.890> very<00:01:32.040> well<00:01:32.159> but

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
think that it works very well but

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
think that it works very well but
anyways<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.750> beads<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.229> here

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
anyways so I have all my beads in here

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
anyways so I have all my beads in here
my<00:01:35.520> camera<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:36.150> fell<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> got

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
my camera actually fell on it and got

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
my camera actually fell on it and got
them<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.040> mixed<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.610> spent<00:01:38.939> like

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
them all mixed up so I just spent like

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
them all mixed up so I just spent like
10<00:01:39.360> minutes<00:01:39.509> putting<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> there

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
10 minutes putting them back in there

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
10 minutes putting them back in there
right<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.040> containers<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.570> all

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
right two containers so I have them all

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.260 
right two containers so I have them all
ready<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.579> picked<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.119> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
ready and then I have I picked out this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.460 
ready and then I have I picked out this
stencil<00:01:45.570> first<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.290> super

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stencil first because it's super

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.100 
stencil first because it's super
adorable<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:47.009> him<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> pillow<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> I'm

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
adorable that's him on a pillow so I'm

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.210 
adorable that's him on a pillow so I'm
going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.780> my<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.020> piece<00:01:52.439> here

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
going to put it in my little piece here

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.499 
going to put it in my little piece here
and<00:01:54.229> there<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:56.810> holes<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:59.060> I<00:02:00.060> believe

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and there are two holes that I believe

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.060 
and there are two holes that I believe
we<00:02:00.869> need<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:03.469> align

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.969 

and<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.440> had<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.650> look<00:02:09.740> at<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and here so I had to look at the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.500 
and here so I had to look at the
instructions<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.030> don't<00:02:11.330> remember

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
instructions because I don't remember

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.110 
instructions because I don't remember
this<00:02:11.840> part<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> frozen<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.910> was

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
this part with the frozen one so I was

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.670 
this part with the frozen one so I was
kind<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.450> confused<00:02:14.900> about<00:02:15.020> how<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.350> do<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
kind of confused about how to do the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.070 
kind of confused about how to do the
stencil<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.820> basically<00:02:17.180> each<00:02:17.480> one<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.840> these

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
stencil but basically each one of these

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.620 
stencil but basically each one of these
stencils<00:02:18.560> has<00:02:18.800> these<00:02:19.010> two<00:02:19.250> holes<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
stencils has these two holes in the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.060 
stencils has these two holes in the
corners<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.520> put<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.030> on<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.710> lid

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
corners so you just put it on the lid

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.190 
corners so you just put it on the lid
because<00:02:26.000> there's<00:02:26.180> these<00:02:26.360> two<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.660> pigs

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
because there's these two little pigs

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.360 
because there's these two little pigs
and<00:02:27.650> then<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.850> back<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.570> stencil<00:02:29.900> has<00:02:30.650> two

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
and then the back of the stencil has two

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.560 
and then the back of the stencil has two
little<00:02:31.970> hole<00:02:32.330> pegs<00:02:33.050> here<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> goes

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
little hole pegs here and then it goes

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.530 
little hole pegs here and then it goes
on<00:02:36.070> top<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.800> no<00:02:40.520> idea<00:02:40.700> why<00:02:41.180> they<00:02:41.390> did

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
on top of it so no idea why they did

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.370 
on top of it so no idea why they did
that<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.960> why<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.770> not<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:44.380> form-fitting

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that and why it's not like form-fitting

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.360 
that and why it's not like form-fitting
but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:48.340> don't<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:50.800> doesn't<00:02:51.800> seem<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.190> it's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
but I don't know doesn't seem like it's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.230 
but I don't know doesn't seem like it's
aligning<00:02:52.760> very<00:02:53.240> well<00:02:53.480> either<00:02:53.980> assistants<00:02:54.980> all

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
aligning very well either assistants all

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.780 
aligning very well either assistants all
okay<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.300> now<00:02:56.660> I'm<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.990> use<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:58.430> little

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
okay so now I'm going to use this little

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.830 
okay so now I'm going to use this little
brown<00:02:59.410> plastic<00:03:00.410> wand<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.670> we<00:03:01.760> got<00:03:02.000> included

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
brown plastic wand that we got included

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.260 
brown plastic wand that we got included
with<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.290> kit<00:03:03.770> so<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.850> push<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> little

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
with the kit so you just push the little

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.320 
with the kit so you just push the little
button<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.110> opens<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.680> closes<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.330> so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
button and it opens and closes it so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.570 
button and it opens and closes it so
we're<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:08.959> going<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.380> use<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.800> stencil<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
we're just going to use the stencil and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:37.740 
we're just going to use the stencil and
fill<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.090> all<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.810> two<00:03:12.050> beads

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.270 

okay<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:38.810> now<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.170> have<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.470> all<00:03:39.709> filled<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.160> I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
okay so now I have it all filled and I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.699 
okay so now I have it all filled and I
think<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.550> looks<00:03:40.700> really<00:03:40.819> super<00:03:41.510> cute<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
think it looks really super cute and the

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.259 
think it looks really super cute and the
cool<00:03:42.890> thing<00:03:43.099> about<00:03:43.129> this<00:03:43.550> kit<00:03:43.819> is<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.000> there

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
cool thing about this kit is that there

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.960 
cool thing about this kit is that there
are<00:03:44.420> some<00:03:44.599> 3d<00:03:45.080> pieces<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.950> these<00:03:46.160> are<00:03:46.400> actually

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
are some 3d pieces so these are actually

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.949 
are some 3d pieces so these are actually
his<00:03:47.540> arms<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.500> once<00:03:49.220> they're<00:03:49.610> done<00:03:50.120> sticking

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
his arms and once they're done sticking

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.869 
his arms and once they're done sticking
together<00:03:51.080> then<00:03:51.590> we'll<00:03:51.709> stick<00:03:51.890> them<00:03:52.010> on<00:03:52.250> top<00:03:52.549> of

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
together then we'll stick them on top of

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.839 
together then we'll stick them on top of
this<00:03:53.599> one<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.620> will<00:03:54.739> look<00:03:54.890> kind<00:03:55.099> of<00:03:55.220> 3d<00:03:55.549> so

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
this one and it will look kind of 3d so

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.570 
this one and it will look kind of 3d so
now<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.450> filled<00:03:57.049> up<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:58.280> spray<00:03:58.549> bottle

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
now I filled up my little spray bottle

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.119 
now I filled up my little spray bottle
with<00:03:59.060> water<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.629> just<00:03:59.720> plain<00:04:00.080> water

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
with water it's just plain water

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.490 
with water it's just plain water
just<00:04:01.790> regular<00:04:01.940> room-temperature<00:04:02.840> water<00:04:02.989> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
just regular room-temperature water and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.490 
just regular room-temperature water and
now<00:04:03.560> I'm<00:04:03.620> going<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.980> spray<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.750> beads<00:04:06.110> and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
now I'm going to spray the beads and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.110 
now I'm going to spray the beads and
basically<00:04:06.890> what's<00:04:07.160> gonna<00:04:07.280> happen<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.819> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
basically what's gonna happen is the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.059 
basically what's gonna happen is the
beads<00:04:08.329> are<00:04:08.450> kind<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.810> covered<00:04:09.140> in<00:04:09.290> like<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.440> glue

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
beads are kind of covered in like a glue

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.520 
beads are kind of covered in like a glue
that's<00:04:10.549> water<00:04:10.819> activated<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.720> it'll<00:04:11.959> kind<00:04:12.410> of

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
that's water activated and it'll kind of

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:25.110 
that's water activated and it'll kind of
adhere<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.310> beads<00:04:13.489> together<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.329> here<00:04:14.690> we<00:04:14.750> go

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.400 

okay<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.180> now<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.389> I<00:04:26.600> sprayed<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.050> I'm<00:04:27.200> going

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
okay so now that I sprayed it I'm going

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.350 
okay so now that I sprayed it I'm going
to<00:04:27.440> let<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.740> completely<00:04:28.370> dry<00:04:28.520> before<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.120> try<00:04:29.270> to

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
to let it completely dry before I try to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.879 
to let it completely dry before I try to
take<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.630> off<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.050> thing<00:04:30.350> because

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
take it off of this thing because

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.610 
take it off of this thing because
otherwise<00:04:31.220> it'll<00:04:31.550> break<00:04:32.169> okay<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:33.229> now<00:04:33.590> that

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
otherwise it'll break okay so now that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.370 
otherwise it'll break okay so now that
our<00:04:34.070> piece<00:04:34.370> has<00:04:34.729> somewhat<00:04:35.449> dried<00:04:35.840> we're<00:04:36.139> going

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
our piece has somewhat dried we're going

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.180 
our piece has somewhat dried we're going
to<00:04:36.560> attach<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.479> extra<00:04:38.479> arm<00:04:38.750> pieces<00:04:39.080> onto<00:04:39.979> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
to attach the extra arm pieces onto the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.129 
to attach the extra arm pieces onto the
tops<00:04:40.580> so<00:04:41.000> I'm<00:04:41.060> just<00:04:41.180> going<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.419> spray<00:04:41.750> again<00:04:42.110> a

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
tops so I'm just going to spray again a

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:56.260 
tops so I'm just going to spray again a
little<00:04:42.350> bit<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:43.340> put<00:04:44.300> his<00:04:44.660> arm<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:54.940> have<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.090> say

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
little bit and put his arm I have to say

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.589 
little bit and put his arm I have to say
that<00:04:57.190> aqua<00:04:58.190> beads<00:04:58.430> are<00:04:58.789> a<00:04:58.849> little<00:04:59.450> bit

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
that aqua beads are a little bit

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.500 
that aqua beads are a little bit
frustrating<00:05:00.440> for<00:05:00.680> me<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:01.250> had<00:05:01.849> a<00:05:01.880> really<00:05:02.240> really

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
frustrating for me I had a really really

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.320 
frustrating for me I had a really really
hard<00:05:02.720> time<00:05:03.020> with<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:03.470> kit<00:05:04.070> this<00:05:04.910> is<00:05:05.030> actually

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
hard time with this kit this is actually

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.360 
hard time with this kit this is actually
the<00:05:05.450> second<00:05:05.840> one<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:05.960> I've<00:05:06.169> made<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.710> this

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
the second one that I've made of this

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.550 
the second one that I've made of this
one<00:05:07.669> because<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.630> first<00:05:08.840> one<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.050> did<00:05:09.349> I

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
one because the first one I did I

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.200 
one because the first one I did I
sprayed<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:09.889> on<00:05:09.979> with<00:05:10.160> water<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.700> let<00:05:10.849> it<00:05:10.940> dry

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
sprayed it on with water and let it dry

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.700 
sprayed it on with water and let it dry
and<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.660> actually<00:05:11.840> curled<00:05:12.530> up<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.330> broke<00:05:14.330> and

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
and it actually curled up and broke and

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.370 
and it actually curled up and broke and
so<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.740> had<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.099> redo<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.080> was<00:05:18.169> really

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
so I had to redo it and it was really

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.500 
so I had to redo it and it was really
annoying<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.070> frustrating<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:20.090> make<00:05:20.479> sure

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
annoying and frustrating so make sure

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.020 
annoying and frustrating so make sure
that<00:05:20.720> when<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.200> do<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.620> especially<00:05:22.610> the

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
that when you do this especially the

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.339 
that when you do this especially the
bigger<00:05:23.270> pieces<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:24.910> wait<00:05:25.910> for<00:05:26.090> them<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.349> harden

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
bigger pieces to wait for them to harden

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.379 
bigger pieces to wait for them to harden
a<00:05:27.620> little<00:05:27.800> bit<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.370> then<00:05:28.580> take<00:05:28.760> them<00:05:28.910> off<00:05:29.090> and

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
a little bit and then take them off and

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.240 
a little bit and then take them off and
then<00:05:29.539> put<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.110> in<00:05:30.200> between<00:05:30.349> two<00:05:30.590> flat<00:05:30.979> things

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
then put it in between two flat things

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.460 
then put it in between two flat things
so<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.150> they<00:05:32.240> don't<00:05:32.360> curl<00:05:32.690> up<00:05:32.900> because<00:05:33.260> it

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
so that they don't curl up because it

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.839 
so that they don't curl up because it
totally<00:05:33.740> ruined<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.280> first<00:05:34.490> one<00:05:34.639> that<00:05:34.729> was

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
totally ruined the first one that was

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.540 
totally ruined the first one that was
really<00:05:35.120> really<00:05:35.300> sad<00:05:35.539> so<00:05:36.289> make<00:05:37.070> sure<00:05:37.099> to<00:05:37.400> do

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
really really sad so make sure to do

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.779 
really really sad so make sure to do
that

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
that

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.060 
that
I<00:05:38.060> did<00:05:38.450> make<00:05:38.599> I<00:05:38.780> did<00:05:38.990> try<00:05:39.289> to<00:05:39.320> make<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.770> carrot

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
I did make I did try to make a carrot

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.469 
I did make I did try to make a carrot
ory<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.639> was<00:05:40.789> not<00:05:41.000> working<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.419> I<00:05:41.450> was

ory and I was not working and I was
getting<00:05:41.690> super<00:05:41.990> frustrated<00:05:42.440> so<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:42.590> gave<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:42.770> on

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
getting super frustrated so I gave up on

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.860 
getting super frustrated so I gave up on
him<00:05:43.010> but<00:05:43.789> I<00:05:43.820> do<00:05:43.940> like<00:05:44.270> these<00:05:44.419> three<00:05:44.659> pieces

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
him but I do like these three pieces

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.080 
him but I do like these three pieces
that<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.289> made<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.130> I<00:05:46.159> did<00:05:46.550> finish

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
that I made so I did finish

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.390 
that I made so I did finish
the<00:05:47.180> one<00:05:47.389> with<00:05:47.570> him<00:05:47.780> on<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.080> pillow<00:05:48.290> and<00:05:48.620> then

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
the one with him on the pillow and then

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.230 
the one with him on the pillow and then
he<00:05:49.639> has<00:05:49.850> like<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.270> little<00:05:50.540> 3d<00:05:51.530> arms<00:05:52.210> now<00:05:53.210> I

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
he has like the little 3d arms now I

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.659 
he has like the little 3d arms now I
tried<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.900> just<00:05:54.080> stick<00:05:54.320> them<00:05:54.440> on<00:05:54.680> like<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.460> saw

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
tried to just stick them on like you saw

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.180 
tried to just stick them on like you saw
before<00:05:55.970> but<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.139> was<00:05:57.199> also<00:05:57.530> frustrating<00:05:58.070> me

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
before but that was also frustrating me

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.680 
before but that was also frustrating me
so<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.400> ended<00:05:58.610> up<00:05:58.760> just<00:05:58.910> hot<00:05:59.090> gluing<00:05:59.419> them<00:05:59.510> on

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
so I ended up just hot gluing them on

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.409 
so I ended up just hot gluing them on
which<00:05:59.900> was<00:06:00.080> much<00:06:00.560> much<00:06:00.889> easier<00:06:00.949> for<00:06:01.580> me<00:06:01.729> the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
which was much much easier for me the

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.000 
which was much much easier for me the
problem<00:06:02.630> is<00:06:02.900> is<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.139> spray<00:06:03.470> them<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.919> then

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
problem is is you spray them and then

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.610 
problem is is you spray them and then
they<00:06:04.100> get<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.340> little<00:06:04.490> bit<00:06:04.820> slimy<00:06:05.150> and<00:06:05.750> that's

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
they get a little bit slimy and that's

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.020 
they get a little bit slimy and that's
the<00:06:06.919> glue<00:06:07.160> that's<00:06:07.460> gonna<00:06:07.550> hold<00:06:07.729> them<00:06:07.880> together

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
the glue that's gonna hold them together

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.760 
the glue that's gonna hold them together
but<00:06:08.660> it<00:06:08.750> just<00:06:08.900> take<00:06:09.050> it<00:06:09.169> takes<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.440> really<00:06:09.590> long

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
but it just take it takes a really long

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.250 
but it just take it takes a really long
time<00:06:10.010> for<00:06:10.070> them<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.490> stick<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.510> with<00:06:12.139> the

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
time for them to stick and with the

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.990 
time for them to stick and with the
pieces<00:06:12.650> that<00:06:12.830> are<00:06:12.979> 3d<00:06:13.460> it<00:06:13.669> doesn't<00:06:13.910> really

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
pieces that are 3d it doesn't really

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.360 
pieces that are 3d it doesn't really
stick<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.540> well<00:06:14.750> for<00:06:14.990> me<00:06:15.139> so<00:06:15.500> personally<00:06:16.340> I

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
stick that well for me so personally I

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.280 
stick that well for me so personally I
find<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:16.790> much<00:06:16.880> easier<00:06:16.940> to<00:06:17.270> just<00:06:17.389> glue<00:06:17.870> on<00:06:18.139> the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
find it much easier to just glue on the

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.530 
find it much easier to just glue on the
pieces<00:06:18.680> separately<00:06:19.580> but<00:06:19.850> I<00:06:20.030> really<00:06:20.240> like<00:06:20.389> how

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
pieces separately but I really like how

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.670 
pieces separately but I really like how
this<00:06:20.690> one<00:06:20.840> came<00:06:21.020> out<00:06:21.110> think<00:06:21.290> it's<00:06:21.410> really

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
this one came out think it's really

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.840 
this one came out think it's really
really<00:06:21.860> cute<00:06:22.040> how<00:06:22.190> he's<00:06:22.370> lounging<00:06:22.729> on<00:06:22.790> the

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
really cute how he's lounging on the

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.210 
really cute how he's lounging on the
pillow<00:06:23.150> then<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.200> made<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.530> little<00:06:24.680> korilakkuma

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
pillow then I made a little korilakkuma

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.360 
pillow then I made a little korilakkuma
and<00:06:25.850> this<00:06:25.970> one<00:06:26.120> is<00:06:26.210> cool<00:06:26.450> because<00:06:26.750> it<00:06:26.990> has<00:06:27.889> like

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
and this one is cool because it has like

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.030 
and this one is cool because it has like
her<00:06:28.580> arms<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:29.690> then<00:06:29.990> she's<00:06:30.260> holding<00:06:30.620> like<00:06:30.830> a

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
her arms and then she's holding like a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.230 
her arms and then she's holding like a
little<00:06:31.340> strawberry<00:06:31.580> which<00:06:31.940> i<00:06:32.000> think<00:06:32.060> is

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
little strawberry which i think is

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.370 
little strawberry which i think is
really<00:06:32.510> really<00:06:32.690> cute

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
really really cute

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.409 
really really cute
I<00:06:33.410> really<00:06:33.889> like<00:06:34.040> the<00:06:34.160> 3d<00:06:34.400> aspect<00:06:34.669> of<00:06:35.150> it<00:06:35.270> as

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
I really like the 3d aspect of it as

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.170 
I really like the 3d aspect of it as
much<00:06:35.600> as<00:06:35.750> it's<00:06:35.930> somewhat<00:06:36.470> annoying<00:06:37.090> using<00:06:38.090> the

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
much as it's somewhat annoying using the

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.760 
much as it's somewhat annoying using the
glue<00:06:38.360> definitely<00:06:38.780> makes<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.080> a<00:06:39.139> lot<00:06:39.320> easier<00:06:39.710> I

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
glue definitely makes it a lot easier I

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.700 
glue definitely makes it a lot easier I
was<00:06:40.010> getting<00:06:40.220> so<00:06:40.460> frustrated<00:06:40.490> before<00:06:41.440> but<00:06:42.440> I

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
was getting so frustrated before but I

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.330 
was getting so frustrated before but I
think<00:06:43.100> it<00:06:43.160> came<00:06:43.310> out<00:06:43.400> really<00:06:43.520> cute<00:06:43.820> so<00:06:44.240> I<00:06:45.340> guess

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
think it came out really cute so I guess

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.700 
think it came out really cute so I guess
it's<00:06:46.520> all<00:06:46.639> worth<00:06:46.820> it<00:06:47.000> then<00:06:47.780> I<00:06:47.840> made<00:06:48.110> this<00:06:48.470> one

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
it's all worth it then I made this one

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.500 
it's all worth it then I made this one
which<00:06:48.889> I<00:06:48.979> also<00:06:49.160> think<00:06:49.460> is<00:06:49.520> really<00:06:49.820> cute<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:50.389> was

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
which I also think is really cute I was

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.330 
which I also think is really cute I was
running<00:06:50.720> out<00:06:50.810> of<00:06:50.870> brown<00:06:51.229> so<00:06:51.530> his<00:06:51.680> arms<00:06:52.010> aren't

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
running out of brown so his arms aren't

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.690 
running out of brown so his arms aren't
as<00:06:52.669> long<00:06:52.970> as<00:06:53.270> they<00:06:53.479> should<00:06:53.810> be<00:06:54.340> but<00:06:55.340> I<00:06:55.400> think

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
as long as they should be but I think

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.219 
as long as they should be but I think
it's<00:06:55.789> really<00:06:55.940> cute<00:06:56.210> and<00:06:56.300> it<00:06:56.510> looks<00:06:56.720> like<00:06:56.810> he's
