00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good afternoon dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
 Anna and Pear I am the head of the company 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.690
 xenon pan dot ru 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 last time we get huge 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.910
 number of requests due to the fact that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 so many drivers are denied rights for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 xenon 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.020
 traffic police inspector wrongfully produces 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.210
 disqualification confiscate equipment 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 often even this does not end deprivation 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 we just extort bribes 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.539
 today I want to finally give by 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.300
 about this clarification we have created here 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.700
 such a tool that will allow 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.750
 avoid deprivation in the legal field and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.410
 and give the inspector a squeeze of law 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 why it can't be done but you do it 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 the application can be downloaded from the link 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.980
 below 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.719
 Now I will briefly give an explanation 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 here are the communication guidelines for 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 filming so on will be able to consistently 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.699
 read and use when you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 stopped you can print and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 put in your car so that all the law 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 you had on hand from my own I want 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.439
 add three items which are listed in 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 this article this article 12 5 through 3 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.799
 which is often called inspectors 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 as the main thing Japan is deprived in fact 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 The article does not say anything about xenon and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 discharge lamps there only indicated 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 no way car operation 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 prohibited if color and mode of operation 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 Well, there is still a sample film said but xenon 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.189
 applies color mode of operation which is not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.010
 according to my admission provisions 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.190
 so here 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 here is the full why xenon 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.940
 fit this article why her 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.530
 can not apply use xenu us 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.540
 all would I want to add that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.990
 xenon color white mode 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.430
 standing here too according to the guests and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.530
 regulatory legal acts 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.390
 The explanation given here is also the second 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.220
 point to signs of another article 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.440
 often after you have indicated 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.990
 nonconformity inspector 12 5 hours 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.460
 third xenon they start pointing 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.479
 signs of another article it may be 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.160
 labeling something else making changes 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.990
 in the design and so forth I have 5 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.150
 the third hour is no longer a relationship 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.420
 because color and mode are strictly indicated 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.340
 work in this case you declare 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080
 inspector for what he presents to you 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 signs of another article and necessarily 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 indicate this when drawing up the protocol 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.340
 they are very afraid of it further 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.970
 about labeling and which should be 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.880
 applied 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.040
 they are often why they want to open 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.720
 hood and take off equipment see 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.850
 as they say on labeling will 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.230
 now look so here marking 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.650
 marking on 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.980
 not regulated from September 10, 2010 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 of the year 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.330
 because up to this point was 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.030
 the technical regulations were really there 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.500
 marking here also this is given in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.230
 fourth paragraph about those regulations 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.850
 old has long been represented here 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.620
 technical regulations where indicated 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 what needs labeling and new 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.150
 technical regulations where this marking is removed and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.239
 Now it is valid from September 10 to 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.840
 this September 10 , 2009 was adopted 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.900
 those needles a year later he was changed where 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.660
 marking was removed another article 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.519
 which regulates use 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.910
 gas discharge light source category 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.830
 d she is generally excluded then with her does not have 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.420
 place now on another article inspector 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.580
 can not deprive you because there is there 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.230
 12 not 12 5 part 3 12 4 there is not even 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.800
 the decision and the penalties there are completely different 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.690
 the signs 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.710
 90 percent of cases use exactly 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.670
 this article 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.440
 download this tool for some 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.690
 what questions do you have 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.570
 write in the comments to this video if 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.980
 so the manuals will arise but it 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.230
 training manual based on the practice of communication 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.670
 by me personally with the inspectors because I 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.210
 also stop and all my 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.700
 friends 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.020
 I already did not know 20 or 30 tried 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 solve but knowledge of these articles 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.000
 which they indicate 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.340
 will allow you to avoid it if you are you 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.440
 like it like download this 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.010
 carry out your textbook 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.160
 and I hope that the number of decisions 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.510
 will decrease 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.510
 all happy everyone bye
