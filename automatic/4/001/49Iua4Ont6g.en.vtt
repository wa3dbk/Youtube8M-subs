hit<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> crop<00:01:57.090> button<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.430> it'll

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
hit the crop button right here and it'll

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
hit the crop button right here and it'll
take<00:01:59.490> away<00:01:59.820> everything<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> didn't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
take away everything that you didn't

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.459 
take away everything that you didn't
have<00:02:01.049> selected<00:02:02.360> at<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.719> point<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.439> make

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
have selected at this point I would make

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
have selected at this point I would make
sure<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.219> save<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
sure to save it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
but don't hit file save because then it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.580 
but don't hit file save because then it
will<00:02:09.149> save<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.660> original<00:02:09.750> picture<00:02:10.379> and

will save over your original picture and
your<00:02:11.220> original<00:02:11.280> picture<00:02:11.819> will<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.180> deleted

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
your original picture will be deleted

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.760 
your original picture will be deleted

like this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550 
like this
I<00:02:13.830> would<00:02:14.100> more<00:02:14.400> recommend<00:02:14.940> hitting<00:02:15.210> file<00:02:15.900> save

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
I would more recommend hitting file save

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.610 
I would more recommend hitting file save
as<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:18.560> save<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.070> screen<00:02:20.430> shot<00:02:20.670> 14

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
as and save it as like screen shot 14

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.610 
as and save it as like screen shot 14
edited<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.240> if<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.020> mess<00:02:25.290> something<00:02:25.590> up

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
edited so then if you mess something up

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
edited so then if you mess something up
if<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.250> mess<00:02:29.400> something<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.780> can

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
if you mess something up then you can

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
if you mess something up then you can
still<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.380> back<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> original<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.150> then

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
still go back to the original and then

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.120 
still go back to the original and then
add<00:02:33.660> more<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.320> see<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.770> cut<00:02:35.010> off

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
add more like you can see like I cut off

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.070 
add more like you can see like I cut off
one<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> dots<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.660> saved

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
one of the dots here and if I just saved

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840 
one of the dots here and if I just saved
to<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> original<00:02:37.680> picture<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.520> dot<00:02:38.700> would

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
to the original picture that dot would

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.310 
to the original picture that dot would
have<00:02:38.940> been<00:02:39.030> gone<00:02:39.180> forever<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.960> now<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.200> I'm

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
have been gone forever but now if I'm

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080 
have been gone forever but now if I'm
like<00:02:40.500> ah<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.980> kind<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.490> wanted<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.910> dot

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
like ah I kind of wanted that dot

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.540 
like ah I kind of wanted that dot
actually<00:02:42.630> then<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.770> open<00:02:44.100> up<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> original

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
actually then I can open up the original

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.430 
actually then I can open up the original
still<00:02:45.330> again<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:47.720> draw<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.990> slightly

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
still again and draw a slightly

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.600 
still again and draw a slightly
different<00:02:49.680> box<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:52.230> include<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.980> dot<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.460> now

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
different box to include that dot so now

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.750 
different box to include that dot so now
I<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.940> crop<00:02:54.480> again<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.370> then<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.610> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
I can crop again and then I have that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.260 
I can crop again and then I have that
dot<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.750> would<00:02:58.290> recommend

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
dot in there so I would recommend

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.330 
dot in there so I would recommend
actually<00:03:00.270> even<00:03:00.540> before<00:03:01.020> you<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> crop<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
actually even before you do the crop to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.760 
actually even before you do the crop to
do<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> file<00:03:02.850> save<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.390> as<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.690> new<00:03:04.020> picture<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
do a file save as as a new picture and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.460 
do a file save as as a new picture and
then<00:03:05.280> change<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.320> have

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
then change that but that's all you have

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.040 
then change that but that's all you have
to<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.950> crop<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> picture<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.910> Windows<00:03:09.270> 8<00:03:09.750> or

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
to do to crop a picture in Windows 8 or

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.960 
to do to crop a picture in Windows 8 or
when<00:03:10.380> really<00:03:11.100> whatever<00:03:11.250> Windows<00:03:11.820> operating

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
when really whatever Windows operating

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.030 
when really whatever Windows operating
system<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.720> one<00:03:13.290> thing<00:03:13.440> you'll<00:03:13.590> notice<00:03:13.800> is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
system and one thing you'll notice is

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.860 
system and one thing you'll notice is
that<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.370> original<00:03:14.520> screen<00:03:15.060> shot<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
that the original screen shot that I

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.680 
that the original screen shot that I
took<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.950> look<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.580> size<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.090> it's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
took if you look at the size of it it's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.330 
took if you look at the size of it it's
one<00:03:19.140> point<00:03:19.380> four<00:03:19.650> eight<00:03:19.770> Meg's<00:03:19.980> which<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.310> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
one point four eight Meg's which is a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.710 
one point four eight Meg's which is a
decent<00:03:20.580> sized<00:03:20.880> file<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.850> cropped<00:03:23.850> file

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
decent sized file but the cropped file

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.150 
decent sized file but the cropped file
is<00:03:24.959> actually<00:03:25.140> quite<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> bit<00:03:25.709> small<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.010> only

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
is actually quite a bit small it's only

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.310 
is actually quite a bit small it's only
thirty<00:03:26.490> three<00:03:27.030> point<00:03:27.270> four<00:03:27.510> K<00:03:27.750> bytes<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.170> it's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
thirty three point four K bytes so it's

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.270 
thirty three point four K bytes so it's
like<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:30.450> thirty<00:03:31.020> third<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> size<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.250> guess

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
like a thirty third of the size I guess

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.530 
like a thirty third of the size I guess
so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
so
doing<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.560> can<00:03:34.680> really<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.430> cut

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
doing this you can really if you cut

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.370 
doing this you can really if you cut
down<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.850> picture<00:03:36.480> that's<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.870> too<00:03:36.990> big<00:03:37.140> has<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
down a picture that's just too big has a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.690 
down a picture that's just too big has a
lot<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.590> stuff<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:38.010> don't<00:03:38.160> want<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
lot of stuff that you don't want in it

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.400 
lot of stuff that you don't want in it
you<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.209> get<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.330> much<00:03:39.600> smaller<00:03:39.930> better

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
you can get a much smaller better

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.230 
you can get a much smaller better
picture<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.400> if<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.580> were<00:03:41.670> emailing<00:03:41.850> to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
picture that if you were emailing to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.430 
picture that if you were emailing to
somebody<00:03:42.540> or<00:03:42.660> somebody<00:03:42.930> would<00:03:43.020> take<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.200> lot

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
somebody or somebody would take a lot

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.410 
somebody or somebody would take a lot
less<00:03:43.650> time<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.040> them<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.310> download<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:45.270> more

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
less time for them to download it's more

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.880 
less time for them to download it's more
useful<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.200> internet<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.830> everything<00:03:47.010> so
