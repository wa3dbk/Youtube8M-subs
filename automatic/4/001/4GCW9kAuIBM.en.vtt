up here and turns out the cheese
pregnant<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:10.880> yeah<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.910> wasn't<00:00:12.570> expecting<00:00:13.139> that

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
pregnant so yeah I wasn't expecting that

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.680 
pregnant so yeah I wasn't expecting that
because<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:17.390> banding<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.449> little

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
because they have been banding a little

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.279 
because they have been banding a little
bit<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> their<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.439> box<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
bit in their little box and then the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
bit in their little box and then the
last<00:00:25.529> few<00:00:25.800> days<00:00:25.949> I've<00:00:26.130> noticed<00:00:26.460> Scooby<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
last few days I've noticed Scooby the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380 
last few days I've noticed Scooby the
black<00:00:27.480> beard<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> guess<00:00:29.000> that's<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
black beard so I guess that's when it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.850 
black beard so I guess that's when it
kind<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> happened<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.289> she<00:00:31.590> actually<00:00:32.489> has

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
kind of happened but she actually has

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.930 
kind of happened but she actually has
quite<00:00:34.860> large<00:00:35.280> egg<00:00:36.860> bulges<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.950> her<00:00:38.100> stomach<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
quite large egg bulges on her stomach so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.680 
quite large egg bulges on her stomach so
it<00:00:39.149> must<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.480> happened<00:00:39.600> before<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:41.690> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it must have happened before then so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.750 
it must have happened before then so
I'll<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:43.020> around<00:00:46.280> she's<00:00:47.280> huge

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
I'll just go around she's huge

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.650 
I'll just go around she's huge
um<00:00:53.420> we<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.570> around<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:56.420> okay

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
um we go around this side okay

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.130 
um we go around this side okay
just<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:58.440> shots<00:00:58.680> focus<00:01:00.350> -<00:01:01.350> let's<00:01:01.649> wrap<00:01:01.800> here
