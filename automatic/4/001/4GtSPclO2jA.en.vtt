be<00:04:48.669> best<00:04:49.120> for<00:04:49.300> yourself<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.349> that<00:04:51.189> moment<00:04:51.490> you

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
be best for yourself in that moment you

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.719 
be best for yourself in that moment you
truly<00:04:52.449> believe<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:53.080> do<00:04:53.469> not<00:04:53.500> deserve<00:04:54.250> what's

characters going through that emotion we

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.519 
characters going through that emotion we

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
I like blink I like her a lot I think

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.920 
I like blink I like her a lot I think
she's<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.430> very<00:05:42.699> interesting<00:05:43.060> character<00:05:43.449> but

she's a very interesting character but

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.450 
she's a very interesting character but
this<00:05:44.050> being<00:05:44.259> said<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.710> don't<00:05:44.949> think<00:05:45.159> that<00:05:45.310> she's

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
this being said I don't think that she's

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.240 
this being said I don't think that she's
been<00:05:45.639> utilized<00:05:46.180> enough<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.870> justify<00:05:47.319> a<00:05:47.770> solo

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
been utilized enough to justify a solo

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.369 
been utilized enough to justify a solo
series<00:05:48.610> there<00:05:49.300> are<00:05:49.389> a<00:05:49.419> couple<00:05:49.599> of<00:05:49.839> x-men<00:05:50.199> that

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
series there are a couple of x-men that

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.619 
series there are a couple of x-men that
I<00:05:50.409> would<00:05:50.560> like<00:05:50.710> her<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:50.919> work<00:05:51.279> with<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.940> pixie

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
I would like her to work with like pixie

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.839 
I would like her to work with like pixie
but<00:05:53.139> they're<00:05:53.289> both<00:05:53.409> teleporters<00:05:54.279> so<00:05:54.699> that

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
but they're both teleporters so that

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.459 
but they're both teleporters so that
really<00:05:55.210> wouldn't<00:05:55.539> work

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
really wouldn't work

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.749 
really wouldn't work
I<00:05:56.500> think<00:05:56.919> her<00:05:57.039> powers<00:05:57.400> have<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.580> lot<00:05:57.729> of

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
I think her powers have a lot of

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.640 
I think her powers have a lot of
potential<00:05:58.120> because<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.569> lot<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.839> other<00:05:59.080> mutants

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
potential because a lot of other mutants

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.040 
potential because a lot of other mutants
that<00:05:59.770> can<00:05:59.949> teleport<00:06:00.250> need<00:06:00.939> to<00:06:01.089> use<00:06:01.270> magic<00:06:01.569> or

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
that can teleport need to use magic or
