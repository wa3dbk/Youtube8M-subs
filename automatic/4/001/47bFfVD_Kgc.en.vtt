scratches<00:00:20.760> well<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.420> mostly<00:00:21.750> tape<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.470> some

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
scratches well it's mostly tape and some

scratches well it's mostly tape and some
bit<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> dirt<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.880> stuff<00:00:24.119> um<00:00:24.830> there's<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> all

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
bit of dirt and stuff um there's the all

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.390 
bit of dirt and stuff um there's the all
the<00:00:26.609> i/o<00:00:26.990> now<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.410> notice<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the i/o now if you notice right here and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.920 
the i/o now if you notice right here and
here<00:00:29.609> there's<00:00:30.210> no<00:00:30.779> cards<00:00:31.289> inside<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:32.040> no<00:00:32.279> i/o

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
here there's no cards inside or no i/o

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.340 
here there's no cards inside or no i/o
because<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.829> logic<00:00:35.280> board<00:00:35.520> inside<00:00:36.350> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
because there's no logic board inside so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.240 
because there's no logic board inside so
it<00:00:37.440> looks<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.930> um<00:00:40.100> there's<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it looks like that now um there's a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
it looks like that now um there's a
white<00:00:41.520> piece<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.120> sitting<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
white piece that's sitting there I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
white piece that's sitting there I
actually<00:00:42.930> took<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> off<00:00:43.730> there's<00:00:44.730> no<00:00:44.879> power

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
actually took it off there's no power

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.639 
actually took it off there's no power
book<00:00:46.579> I'll<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> video<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.210> later<00:00:50.449> it

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
book I'll do a video on that later it

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
book I'll do a video on that later it
sits<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:54.000> sits<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:55.620> sits<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
sits it sits in it sits in like that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.439 
sits it sits in it sits in like that
somewhat<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.609> just<00:00:59.609> took<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
somewhat I just took it out because I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
somewhat I just took it out because I
wanted<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> could<00:01:01.500> fit<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.010> old

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
wanted to see if I could fit this old

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.050 
wanted to see if I could fit this old
logic<00:01:03.239> board<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> obviously<00:01:04.350> warm<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> that's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
logic board in obviously warm so that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
logic board in obviously warm so that's
why<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> um<00:01:06.890> well<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.310> fit<00:01:08.640> without<00:01:08.820> some

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
why I um well it would fit without some

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
why I um well it would fit without some
major<00:01:09.840> modifications<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> case<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
major modifications to the case but I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.929 
major modifications to the case but I
really<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.530> um<00:01:13.939> I'm

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
really don't want to do that so um I'm

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.240 
really don't want to do that so um I'm
looking<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.390> logic<00:01:16.140> boards<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.630> CPU

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
looking for logic boards and also a CPU

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
looking for logic boards and also a CPU
so<00:01:20.250> yeah<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> eventually<00:01:21.450> once<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.780> get

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so yeah and eventually once I get

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740 
so yeah and eventually once I get
everything<00:01:22.170> working<00:01:22.549> I'll<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.880> use

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
everything working I'll probably use

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.620 
everything working I'll probably use
this<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.100> computer<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> home<00:01:27.240> theater

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this use this computer as a home theater

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.770 
this use this computer as a home theater
system<00:01:28.049> once<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:28.909> decent<00:01:29.909> graphics<00:01:30.060> card

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.910 

may<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:33.930> may<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.829> I'm

I'm<00:02:24.730> guessing<00:02:25.180> Nvidia<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.459> video<00:02:27.850> 1<00:02:28.060> 7<00:02:28.450> like

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
I'm guessing Nvidia so in video 1 7 like

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.050 
I'm guessing Nvidia so in video 1 7 like
that<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.830> says<00:02:29.950> duo<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.489> there<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:30.940> I'm

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
that that says duo right there so I'm

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.680 
that that says duo right there so I'm
guessing<00:02:31.420> dual<00:02:31.720> 1<00:02:32.230> gigahertz<00:02:33.120> 56k<00:02:34.120> modem<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
guessing dual 1 gigahertz 56k modem and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.740 
guessing dual 1 gigahertz 56k modem and
yeah<00:02:37.690> Gigabit<00:02:38.560> Ethernet<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.330> modems

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
yeah Gigabit Ethernet but the modems
