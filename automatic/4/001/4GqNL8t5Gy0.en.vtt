worry about really it going with things

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
worry about really it going with things
because<00:01:50.360> there's<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.509> too<00:01:51.780> much<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because there's not too much color in it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.649 
because there's not too much color in it
but<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> has<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.399> nice

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.020 
but it has a really nice
patina<00:01:54.109> and<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.469> in<00:01:54.619> great<00:01:54.799> shape

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030
