00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.550
 and hours before your excellence 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.830
 start the work I would like to 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.440
 communicate to the environmental committee 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.859
 with which he made his excellence of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.070
 we were surprised on the last day 26 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:28.010
 by the official journal in which the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:31.220
 isabela teixeira put on the agenda a 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.719
 procedure which was approved by the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.250
 national environment council 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.250
 conama that allows opens the possibility 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.450
 trafficking of wild animals in the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.120
 Brazil 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.430
 I understand that this measure is 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.280
 extremely serious and goes exactly 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 contrary to the proposals that have been 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.700
 Commission has defended is in the sense of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.789
 protection of wild animals 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.890
 we had with the minister and the 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.009
 ministry or understanding 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.369
 she asked Dr. roney that the 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.130
 president of the ibama who intermediates 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.890
 a negotiation with entities not 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 governmental organizations in defense of 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.600
 our animals 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.270
 this understanding was made by about 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.729
 four meetings the last of them in our 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.600
 state in the state of s達o paulo with cerca 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.990
 of 32 entities representing the whole 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.659
 Brazil in terms of environmental protection and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.600
 This meeting was attended by Roberto 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.799
 cavalcanti who is the secretary of the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.290
 biodiversity of the Ministry of 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.500
 environment that represented beautiful and 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.799
 representing ibama and the next step 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.220
 this meeting would be to send two 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.049
 ibama technicians to the state of s達o paulo 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.540
 where there would be this meeting with the entity 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.600
 that would come in the rio grande do sul santa 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.360
 catarina of the end of the bay of Para 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.119
 brazil as a whole to discuss the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.399
 called the pet list and everyone was caught 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.790
 surprise on the 26th reading the diary 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.490
 officer that as you allow 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.270
 each citizen who 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.140
 in your residence or on your property 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.330
 ten species of endangered animals and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.970
 make your excellency the other members 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.090
 of this commission any family that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.520
 have ten members may have 100 animals 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.910
 which are on the list of species in 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.260
 extinction within your residence or 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.600
 either we are opening and flaring 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.410
 the doors to the trafficking of animals 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.630
 wild in brazil is a temerity 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.510
 the measure taken by the minister yesterday 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.630
 President before I will ever do a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.150
 bid idea is fixed and project of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.540
 Legislative Decree and I have 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 federal chamber to scare the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.860
 this measure that goes exactly in 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.170
 against which the people deflect the streets 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.840
 Brazil does not accept that kind of 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.020
 measure this kind of attitude 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.060
 only with a counter hit 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.550
 where entities with very good will 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.070
 are receiving ministry from the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.940
 environment and its employees that a 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.690
 negotiation and are blocked by a 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.820
 way to extremely say legant through 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.390
 act of the environment minister who did not 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.640
 only made the agenda because she who presides 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.610
 national environment council 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.130
 but did approve this measure without 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.090
 shadow of doubt will harm everyone 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.480
 we 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.110
 wild animals are living a 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.990
 very difficult time and I would like to 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 leave here communicating your 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.860
 excellence that I will 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:05.830
 request to follow up each act that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.850
 determined on the basis of that standard 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.640
 which was approved by CONAMA ie will 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.310
 allow the five thousand and so 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.310
 mayors of cities of the state of s達o 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.420
 paulo estad達o the brazilian states 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 authorize a citizen even in his or her 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.760
 ten wild animals or 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.280
 either we're pulling 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 creating the opportunity to withdraw 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.950
 animals in their natural habitat and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.900
 allowing traffickers step this 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.510
 Yesterday I saw an interview in the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.230
 globe in the state of rio de janeiro 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.650
 the forest police saying that they 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.380
 want to negotiate with traffickers 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.260
 I'm amazed I think I until 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.320
 there was an error perhaps from the writing itself 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.630
 of the newspaper because it is impossible to 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.200
 citizen who has the power of supervision 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.570
 and control of these wild animals 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.510
 make a placement a sense that 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.950
 want an alliance that was a pact with the 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.500
 dealers 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.330
 I hope this is not just for 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.280
 wild animals that the package 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.860
 police trafficker is not with 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.890
 drug traffickers with drug traffickers. 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.770
 other species of weapons is because the 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.880
 impression is this is cream in this 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.560
 that was made surprising 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.200
 so I could not stop recording 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.030
 here and have already requested, I will 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310
 written my request for 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.190
 monitoring of all acts of 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.210
 on account of this new rule 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.010
 was approved and agreed by the lady 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.410
 Minister who is now in the 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.700
 agriculture committee because I think 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.040
 that the environmental commission may 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.440
 has the possibility of the new 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.860
 reduce the number of ministries 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.510
 perhaps it has a proposed merger in the 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.070
 federal government of the ministry of 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.040
 agriculture with the Ministry of 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.930
 environment is very likely because it is a 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.090
 great incentive for us to stop 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.610
 politics that did not attack and 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.360
 we are looking for another activity that is not 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.670
 which has demanded the population in the 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.300
 demonstrating that it intends to oblige 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.300
 survive
