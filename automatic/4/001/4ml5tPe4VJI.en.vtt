00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 do not 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.900
 the program in its operation 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.930
 presented has presented serious 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.309
 deficiencies for example in quality 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.070
 food in the distribution of 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.650
 foods 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 in cases of corruption of the same 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.960
 Comptroller has detected these 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.970
 problems will be really insurmountable 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 before the current edition 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 minister the pro has not gone through 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.680
 many reforms have been made 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 consultancies to give proposals for how 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 it should work however not the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 program has not changed then 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.530
 I consider that the decision you have made 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.009
 the current minister of midis has been the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.009
 more successful 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:21.730
 karma is aimed at boys and girls 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.730
 who they are enrolled in primary education 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.130
 at a national level let's say and it's directed 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.720
 obviously to the most 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 needed from the country no but it's a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.100
 program at the national level then it is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380
 directed to this social group and to whom 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.830
 points to colleges are the colleges where 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.490
 is going to work the cali warma now how 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.840
 will work let's say that to date 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.790
 we only know what he said 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.400
 supreme decree that has created the qual 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.810
 Warma, however, is not yet known 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.690
 the operational plan and manual of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 operations that the same decree 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.340
 establishes that it will come more or less from 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.870
 here a couple of months more then but what 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.060
 what the decree says this supreme decree 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.740
 is that seeing with the same call we're going to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.720
 work in schools and will be 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.290
 charge of parents and in charge 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.180
 of the teachers you are society that is going 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.850
 to train between parents and teachers is going to 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.600
 call the food committees where 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.520
 they will receive the resources not the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.940
 financial resources directly and 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.250
 they are going to buy the food they are going to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.820
 prepare them and finally they are going to 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.820
 to distribute 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.250
 i 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.090
 let's say they are schools manage 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.700
 lists the lists of students who 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.920
 they are enrolled in those schools 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.250
 then there would truly be 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 to avoid what happened in the pro no 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.460
 let's say the program had problems of d 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.810
 low coverage and filtration this what 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.040
 You mean when we talk about low 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.590
 coverage is that the program does not reach 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.610
 who really should arrive or be 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.740
 needy people who do not access this 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.020
 social program and filtration are 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.660
 people who do not need are in the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.890
 program then that what should 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.940
 avoid gauge gun through a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.620
 correct a rigorous 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.780
 targeting of beneficiaries who 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.750
 they are in the lists of the schools 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.480
 now why because the trend that goes 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.420
 to be can suddenly be inflate the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
 number of students to be able to have 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.340
 more resources per school then that 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.739
 Now you have to take care of what the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.880
 mechanisms that are going to do that 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.880
 It is not yet known 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.360
 since the purchases will be in charge 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.910
 of these committees food committees and 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.600
 let's say that these schools are let's say 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.830
 in districts in peasant communities 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.830
 then the producers are close 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.620
 local then they will be able to 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.450
 producers will be able to sell 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.989
 directly to this food committee 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.290
 however there would have to be a lot 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.650
 be careful why, because when 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.380
 manage resources is very easy to favor 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.910
 to certain groups then the people 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.470
 who are managing the resources of the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.350
 food committee can benefit 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 certain groups not then as always 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.600
 always going to be present these 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.380
 let's say these intentions of wanting 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.360
 fulfill the process you have to do 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.750
 what the little ones would have to do 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.580
 local producers is not organized 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.450
 then it is to organize not to be able to 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.080
 sell or supply food 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.040
 permanently to these committees 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.040
 food 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.390
 but nationally praises the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.010
 chronic malnutrition is at 15 per cent 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.120
 percent and anemia is at 30 percent 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.440
 they are still high levels then 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.200
 let's say the program has not attended 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.000
 that now precisely what this is looking for 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.300
 new strategy that is cali warma 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.840
 because it's a strategy is to consume the 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.900
 local products that contain say 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.110
 that contain 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.479
 high nutritional levels and that 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.490
 guys can accept it 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.690
 weekly who is going to give the menu goes to 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.270
 be I will say that playing them as 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.770
 Monday through Tuesday until Friday 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.600
 then and depending on that these 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.220
 committees on these food committees 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.910
 they will have to do the shopping 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.630
 then it's going to be a diet 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.600
 varied more nutritious probably with 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.460
 products of the area however there 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.070
 there is also another questioning another 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.169
 an attitude not who controls these 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.419
 committees these food committees that 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.970
 they will effectively comply with 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.289
 quantities and the contents let's say 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.289
 Nutritional menu 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.830
 effectively all the programs 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.550
 sensors that exist that have existed in 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.020
 the case of the throne that exist has the 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.120
 happening to be welfare or 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.100
 only food stocks 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.100
 vulnerable or act when there 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.880
 disaster saves the moment but does not see 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.039
 future now what would not ideally be 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.410
 that this program cali or weapon and others 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.259
 social programs that could go into 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.810
 the way is that besides giving this this 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.210
 help that is to give food that 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.860
 obviously it is necessary because 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.800
 malnutrition has to be reduced 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.780
 chronic childhood and anemia is 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.990
 that save that but you should also go 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.199
 accompanied with measures that the guys 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.620
 start to know and handle well 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.729
 safety cleaning habits and the 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.729
 families also not 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.810
 so what you have to do in me is 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.940
 act in an articulated manner with other 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.010
 institutions and take advantage of what already 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.540
 they advanced because the ministry of health 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.070
 and the education ministry has already 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.900
 advanced things not then must 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.040
 articulate with these institutions to 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:42.900
 to be able to do social programs that 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.900
 go beyond welfare
