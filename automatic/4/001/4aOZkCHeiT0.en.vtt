00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.439
 good 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.570
 Y 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.619
 Well today we are going to give a couple of tricks and 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.720
 of advice for the maintenance of 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.710
 orchids the activity is usually 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.269
 a plant is given a lot 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.160
 Once we have the nice thing is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.730
 to be able to keep it and be able to do like him 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.439
 it will bloom 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.330
 we will find it in two ways 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.840
 classes in crystal composition and the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.870
 others in ceramics like the one we see here 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.719
 those two 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 the only difference is when 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.519
 of the Greeks the irrigation in crystal has 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.700
 that be less and less frequently and 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.920
 the 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.420
 must be 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.929
 more more often more often and with 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.289
 and be very careful with excess 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.490
 humidity 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.580
 the most trick 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.700
 important when it comes to an orchid 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.040
 again to flower is the prune the tail of 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 the rod that is drying for example 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 in this case I'm going to remove all that more 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 that you do not believe well 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.460
 He does not have any 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 then all the flowering is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 starting to dry then we have to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.299
 keep in mind that if this does not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.399
 we may or may not cut it or leave it in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.890
 their natural state are going to tend to 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.380
 dry the whole workshop that does not want 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 say that there is no delivery but yes 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.799
 it means that it will cost a lot 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.460
 more front then always below 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.590
 of him 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.729
 of the outbreak that is drying up that has 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.530
 drying 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.850
 here we have the coast here and here until 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 here we would have to cut 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.880
 and these knots that we have left below is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 where the rod itself will return to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.320
 throw a bar and you will get the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.770
 flowering like the one we have here from 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.910
 otherwise it could flourish again 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.790
 discarding a new rod with which 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.290
 that's going to cost a lot more time 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 it's harder it's going to cost more and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.390
 then after doing this, return it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.980
 to put in place and with a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.580
 lighting will immediately bloom again 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.830
 irrigation 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.480
 I mentioned it before there is not having 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.550
 water outlet what we need is 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 do an irrigation with less amount of 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.150
 water but a little more perfect every 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.290
 eight or ten days is your mind in the part 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.819
 from above to let the earth 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.390
 and this we can give perfectly 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.390
 because the river is controlled
