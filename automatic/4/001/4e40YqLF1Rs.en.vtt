00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
pilot episode and then the future I'll

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.050 
pilot episode and then the future I'll
probably<00:04:32.230> look<00:04:32.440> back<00:04:32.680> on<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.190> video<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
probably look back on this video the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.170 
probably look back on this video the
video<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.419> such<00:04:34.630> bad<00:04:34.840> quality<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:36.820> kidding

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
video of such bad quality I'm kidding

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.430 
video of such bad quality I'm kidding
actually<00:04:37.419> I<00:04:37.480> think<00:04:37.540> this<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:38.110> quote<00:04:38.320> was

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
actually I think this is this quote was

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.460 
actually I think this is this quote was
actually<00:04:38.740> quite<00:04:38.919> good<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:40.510> let's<00:04:41.290> do

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
actually quite good I think and let's do

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:54.600 
actually quite good I think and let's do
it<00:04:41.500> one<00:04:41.890> more<00:04:41.919> time<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.460> third<00:04:42.910> time<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.430> if<00:04:54.520> the

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
it one more time a third time so if the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.250 
it one more time a third time so if the
camera<00:04:54.820> shaking<00:04:55.240> it's<00:04:55.540> just<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:55.990> it's<00:04:56.110> on

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
camera shaking it's just that it's on

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:07.540 
camera shaking it's just that it's on
the<00:04:56.350> bed<00:04:56.560> okay<00:05:00.540> that's<00:05:01.540> pretty<00:05:01.810> good

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.939 

well<00:05:08.210> it'll<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:09.050> interesting<00:05:09.319> to<00:05:09.530> see<00:05:09.710> how<00:05:09.889> the

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
well it'll be interesting to see how the

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.550 
well it'll be interesting to see how the
key<00:05:10.250> holds<00:05:10.669> up<00:05:10.819> in<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> long<00:05:11.240> run<00:05:11.479> but<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:12.349> far

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
key holds up in the long run but so far

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.969 
key holds up in the long run but so far
it<00:05:12.680> works<00:05:12.830> oh<00:05:14.199> don't<00:05:15.199> put<00:05:15.349> that<00:05:15.470> key<00:05:15.650> back<00:05:15.770> on

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
like the box at latch ain't good for a

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.120 
like the box at latch ain't good for a
lot<00:06:47.210> because<00:06:47.449> I<00:06:47.599> mean<00:06:47.779> I'm<00:06:48.620> not<00:06:48.800> sure<00:06:48.860> if<00:06:49.039> you

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
lot because I mean I'm not sure if you

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.820 
lot because I mean I'm not sure if you
can<00:06:49.219> really<00:06:49.370> get<00:06:49.580> a<00:06:49.610> good<00:06:49.759> lock<00:06:50.029> for<00:06:50.590> $10<00:06:51.620> yeah

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
can really get a good lock for $10 yeah

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.320 
can really get a good lock for $10 yeah
I<00:06:51.860> mean<00:06:52.069> you<00:06:52.130> paint<00:06:52.400> and<00:06:52.580> no<00:06:52.729> so<00:06:53.029> you<00:06:53.120> can't

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
I mean you paint and no so you can't

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.390 
I mean you paint and no so you can't
really<00:06:53.479> expect<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.930> get<00:06:54.050> a<00:06:54.110> good<00:06:54.319> lock<00:06:54.620> but<00:06:55.190> I

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
really expect to get a good lock but I

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.070 
really expect to get a good lock but I
guess<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:55.669> should<00:06:55.909> because<00:06:56.240> that's<00:06:56.750> the<00:06:56.930> name

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080
