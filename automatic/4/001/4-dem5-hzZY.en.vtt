00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.850
 we will need to make a flower 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.939
 rectangle 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:22.520
 721 listened 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:22.520
 Fold the corners of the sexes 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 move it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:46.730
 send him a tick replace here 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.730
 center triangles so everything will turn 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.690
 center of the side bend 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.390
 turn over this side 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 we bring exactly parallel 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:16.189
 it turns out that this line of foot from this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:16.189
 lines then but hide the side like this 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.009
 here we get a wolf can 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.610
 with mascara brought from the same side 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:33.020
 let's do the same procedure of this line 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
 fold the corner like this 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:42.119
 unfold 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:46.939
 hiding his center from both sides 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.569
 turned out such corners now we 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:58.759
 we combine the side of Odessa exactly 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:58.759
 smooth and fold sides 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:15.769
 expand the picture Kelly is not on the cross 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:20.150
 and hide inside this corner too 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.700
 you can hide it all this one petal 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 ready now we will collect all 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:45.709
 my mother's petals are glued with this glue 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:03:01.010
 hand we do the same thing grease 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 glue and glue this corner already and then 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.769
 all the corners we leave paste 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:21.489
 from here we glue everything together 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.489
 all flower 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:31.670
 that's what happened with me now we take here 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:34.329
 these little corners unbend to get 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.180
 such a flower 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:43.710
 of course when the paper is on one side 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:04:17.460
 painted with one other color 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:04:19.410
 it turns out more beautiful here with that 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:24.240
 parties we will do the same with 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.670
 petals and now we get this 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:40.100
 a flower on the other side also needs everything 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:40.100
 it's a pink flower
