engineer weapons so here is what i think

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.940 
engineer weapons so here is what i think
are<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.820> main<00:00:40.969> advantages<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.079> guy<00:00:42.320> this

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
are the main advantages of this guy this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.979 
are the main advantages of this guy this
car<00:00:43.190> has<00:00:43.309> high<00:00:43.489> damage<00:00:43.789> gives<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.390> an<00:00:44.510> edge<00:00:44.690> as

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
car has high damage gives it an edge as

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.319 
car has high damage gives it an edge as
it<00:00:45.289> can<00:00:45.440> throw<00:00:45.770> anyone<00:00:46.280> at<00:00:46.550> medium<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.149> long

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
it can throw anyone at medium to long

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.810 
it can throw anyone at medium to long
range<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.289> is<00:00:48.469> almost<00:00:48.800> useless<00:00:49.190> at<00:00:49.579> close

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
range but it is almost useless at close

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.630 
range but it is almost useless at close
range<00:00:50.090> it<00:00:50.360> slow<00:00:51.079> rate<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.350> fire<00:00:51.440> can<00:00:52.219> be<00:00:52.370> seen

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
range it slow rate of fire can be seen

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.779 
range it slow rate of fire can be seen
as<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:53.420> disadvantage<00:00:54.230> but<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.710> reality<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.640> is

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
as a disadvantage but in reality it is

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.580 
as a disadvantage but in reality it is
quite<00:00:56.030> an<00:00:56.149> advantage<00:00:56.690> as<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:56.989> makes<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.410> more

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
quite an advantage as it makes it more

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.220 
quite an advantage as it makes it more

is<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.530> major<00:01:03.829> issue<00:01:03.980> but<00:01:04.910> be<00:01:05.059> sure<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.269> note

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
is a major issue but be sure to note

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.690 
is a major issue but be sure to note
that<00:01:05.630> you'll<00:01:06.170> find<00:01:06.500> yourself<00:01:06.950> reloading

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
that you'll find yourself reloading

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.340 
that you'll find yourself reloading
around<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.060> same<00:01:08.270> amount<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.600> time<00:01:08.660> you<00:01:09.200> would

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
around the same amount of time you would

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.680 
around the same amount of time you would
with<00:01:09.590> any<00:01:09.830> other<00:01:09.979> caravan<00:01:10.729> mainly<00:01:11.390> because<00:01:11.420> of

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
with any other caravan mainly because of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.140 
with any other caravan mainly because of
its<00:01:11.990> slow<00:01:12.170> rate<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.590> fire<00:01:12.680> which<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.280> probably

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
its slow rate of fire which is probably

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.870 
its slow rate of fire which is probably
con<00:01:14.450> spin<00:01:14.750> sated<00:01:15.140> by<00:01:15.170> its<00:01:15.470> high<00:01:15.770> damage<00:01:16.070> also

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
con spin sated by its high damage also

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.149 
con spin sated by its high damage also
its<00:01:17.450> reload<00:01:17.780> time<00:01:17.990> isn't<00:01:18.170> too<00:01:18.439> long<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.040> the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
its reload time isn't too long so the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.580 
its reload time isn't too long so the
real<00:01:19.280> problem<00:01:19.790> is<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.270> guns<00:01:20.540> magazine<00:01:21.140> but

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
real problem is in the guns magazine but

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.469 
real problem is in the guns magazine but
the<00:01:21.740> fact<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.340> isn't<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.939> best<00:01:23.150> for

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
the fact that it isn't the best for

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.230 
the fact that it isn't the best for
close<00:01:23.780> range<00:01:23.930> due<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.530> its<00:01:24.680> prey<00:01:24.950> be<00:01:25.820> sure<00:01:26.060> to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
close range due to its prey be sure to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.090 
close range due to its prey be sure to
note<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:26.900> always<00:01:27.500> better<00:01:27.710> if<00:01:27.920> you're

note that it is always better if you're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.310 
note that it is always better if you're
standing<00:01:28.369> still<00:01:28.790> as<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.450> spread<00:01:30.020> gets

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
standing still as it spread gets

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.249 
standing still as it spread gets
considerably<00:01:30.939> higher<00:01:31.939> if<00:01:32.210> you're<00:01:32.360> moving<00:01:32.720> now

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
considerably higher if you're moving now

the bipod is very good as a default the
weapon<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.780> wonderful<00:02:00.290> when<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.740> comes<00:02:01.250> to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
weapon is wonderful when it comes to

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.580 
weapon is wonderful when it comes to
taking<00:02:01.790> out<00:02:02.000> enemies<00:02:02.450> at<00:02:02.659> medium<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.320> long

taking out enemies at medium to long

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.399 
taking out enemies at medium to long
range<00:02:03.619> which<00:02:04.430> also<00:02:04.700> gives<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.329> some<00:02:05.659> kind<00:02:05.930> of<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
range which also gives it some kind of a

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.100 
range which also gives it some kind of a
supportive<00:02:07.250> role<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.880> weapon<00:02:08.269> saban<00:02:09.079> a

high-powered scope and you can be pretty

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.650

efficient<00:02:12.620> at<00:02:12.769> longer<00:02:13.400> ranges<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.480> cuts

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
efficient at longer ranges as it cuts

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.689

off<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.049> spread<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.530> recall<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.370> weapon

putting on a for grip on this weapon is
indeed<00:02:19.639> an<00:02:19.790> advantage<00:02:20.359> but<00:02:20.840> mainly<00:02:21.079> if<00:02:21.290> you

fire from the hip it also gives at a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
disadvantage because you can't fire from
