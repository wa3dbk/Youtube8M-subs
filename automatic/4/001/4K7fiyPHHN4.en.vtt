she's<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.370> light<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
she's very light and I like the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920 
she's very light and I like the
packaging<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.800> says<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
packaging it says it's the way it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
packaging it says it's the way it
shatters<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.980> matters<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.969> there's

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
shatters that matters and there's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
shatters that matters and there's
pictures<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.289> crumbs<00:00:58.710> falling<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
pictures are like crumbs falling off and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.349 
pictures are like crumbs falling off and
hunt<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.829> probably<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.520> crumbly<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
hunt so it's probably very crumbly and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.000 
hunt so it's probably very crumbly and
in<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.960> opinion<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> looks<00:01:06.210> like

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.190 

not<00:01:11.010> broken<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> broken<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
not broken there was a broken one and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.609 
not broken there was a broken one and
I'd<00:01:13.500> say<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.280> broken<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:15.619> looks

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I'd say it's not good broken one looks

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.160 
I'd say it's not good broken one looks
like<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.100> why<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.000> taste<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.509> oh<00:01:19.939> oh
