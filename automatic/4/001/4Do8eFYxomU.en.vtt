00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
in this clip as my ultimate actually

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.020 
in this clip as my ultimate actually
goes<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.540> cool<00:00:35.809> down<00:00:35.989> before<00:00:36.620> my<00:00:36.829> Q<00:00:37.190> as<00:00:37.790> I'm

goes and cool down before my Q as I'm

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.020 
goes and cool down before my Q as I'm
ulting<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.629> target<00:00:39.079> first<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.769> then<00:00:40.370> queuing

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
ulting the target first and then queuing

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.509

when<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.239> get<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.629> end<00:00:41.839> range<00:00:42.230> rather<00:00:43.190> than<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
when I get to end range rather than the

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.299 
when I get to end range rather than the
more<00:00:43.699> common<00:00:44.179> combo<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.839> using<00:00:45.499> your<00:00:45.589> Q<00:00:45.980> first

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
more common combo of using your Q first

and<00:00:46.579> then<00:00:46.969> ultimate<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.780> target<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:48.890> we're

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
and then ultimate in the target so we're

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.560 
and then ultimate in the target so we're
going<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.159> see<00:00:49.399> that<00:00:49.550> again<00:00:49.609> in<00:00:49.999> this<00:00:50.179> next

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
attention to my ultimate going on

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.430 
attention to my ultimate going on
cooldown<00:00:54.800> there<00:00:55.249> and<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.269> right<00:00:57.079> at<00:00:57.319> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
cooldown there and like you right at the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.559 
cooldown there and like you right at the
end<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.399> might<00:00:58.579> ask<00:00:58.760> why<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.390> this

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
end and you might ask why is this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.559 
end and you might ask why is this
beneficial<00:00:59.979> well<00:01:00.979> as<00:01:01.519> your<00:01:01.729> q<00:01:02.030> as<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.179> skill

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
beneficial well as your q as a skill

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.780 
beneficial well as your q as a skill
shot<00:01:02.839> it's<00:01:03.350> obviously<00:01:03.710> harder<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.339> hit<00:01:04.550> on<00:01:04.729> a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
shot it's obviously harder to hit on a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.300 
shot it's obviously harder to hit on a
moving<00:01:05.269> target<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:06.320> your<00:01:06.560> ultimate<00:01:07.100> which

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
moving target then your ultimate which

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.580 
moving target then your ultimate which
is<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> targeted<00:01:08.030> ability<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:09.170> actually<00:01:09.530> a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
is a targeted ability it's actually a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.429 
is a targeted ability it's actually a
lot<00:01:09.830> faster<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.490> use<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.820> combo<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.329> this<00:01:11.509> way<00:01:11.750> so

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
lot faster to use a combo in this way so

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.020 
lot faster to use a combo in this way so
in<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:12.770> next<00:01:13.070> clip<00:01:13.399> we're<00:01:13.640> going<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.820> see

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
in this next clip we're going to see

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.670 
in this next clip we're going to see
something<00:01:14.360> which<00:01:14.719> most<00:01:14.960> people<00:01:15.380> are<00:01:15.469> probably

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
something which most people are probably

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.550 
something which most people are probably
aware<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.119> is<00:01:17.210> using<00:01:17.540> minions<00:01:18.229> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
aware of and that is using minions to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.380 
aware of and that is using minions to
catch<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.009> targets<00:01:19.430> who<00:01:19.520> are<00:01:19.670> out<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.880> range

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
catch the targets who are out of range

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.289 
catch the targets who are out of range
however<00:01:21.200> we're<00:01:21.590> going<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.799> see<00:01:22.009> here<00:01:22.340> outgoing

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
however we're going to see here outgoing

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.899 
however we're going to see here outgoing
and<00:01:23.479> cooldown<00:01:23.840> 24<00:01:24.680> seconds<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> key

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
and cooldown 24 seconds and then the key

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.389 
and cooldown 24 seconds and then the key
word<00:01:26.119> end<00:01:26.270> range<00:01:26.600> which<00:01:27.320> gives<00:01:27.619> us<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.950> ulti

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
word end range which gives us the ulti

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.550 
word end range which gives us the ulti
to<00:01:28.579> catch<00:01:28.969> on<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> target<00:01:29.780> who<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.200> fleeing

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
to catch on to the target who is fleeing

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.670 
to catch on to the target who is fleeing
out<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.280> range<00:01:31.520> our<00:01:31.820> initial<00:01:32.210> combo<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.840> why

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
out of range our initial combo and why

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.440 
out of range our initial combo and why
would<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.070> use<00:01:34.130> your<00:01:34.369> key<00:01:34.640> because<00:01:35.119> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
would you not use your key because the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.569 
would you not use your key because the
minion<00:01:35.840> wave<00:01:35.869> moves<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.799> it's<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.159> lot<00:01:37.399> easier

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
minion wave moves and it's a lot easier

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.899 
minion wave moves and it's a lot easier
and<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.180> lot<00:01:38.420> faster<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.930> do<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> otq

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
and it's a lot faster to do the otq

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.920 
and it's a lot faster to do the otq
rather<00:01:40.909> than<00:01:41.149> doing<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.539> other<00:01:41.780> way

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
rather than doing it the other way

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.370 
rather than doing it the other way
around

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
around

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.060 
around
so<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.820> basic<00:01:44.329> technique<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.680> to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
so the basic technique to this is to

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.550 
so the basic technique to this is to
bolt<00:01:46.340> onto<00:01:46.700> your<00:01:46.909> target<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.659> then<00:01:48.109> while

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
bolt onto your target and then while

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.830 
bolt onto your target and then while
you're<00:01:48.710> midair<00:01:49.130> flick<00:01:49.820> your<00:01:50.030> mouse<00:01:50.179> forward

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you're midair flick your mouse forward

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.859 
you're midair flick your mouse forward
of<00:01:51.049> its<00:01:51.439> original<00:01:51.979> location<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.850> key<00:01:53.420> at<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
of its original location and key at the

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.990 
of its original location and key at the
end<00:01:53.899> range<00:01:54.380> almost<00:01:55.039> immediately<00:01:55.579> after

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
end range almost immediately after
