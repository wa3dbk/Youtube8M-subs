00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
across the certain amount I mean just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.199 
across the certain amount I mean just
totally<00:02:52.829> crazy<00:02:53.129> things<00:02:53.639> that<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.909> could<00:02:54.060> be

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
doing it makes it very very interest

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.710 
doing it makes it very very interest
always<00:02:56.700> something<00:02:57.120> different<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.599> other

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
always something different and the other

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.879 
always something different and the other
big<00:02:57.989> difference<00:02:58.139> is<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:59.250> p90x<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.799> know

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
big difference is with p90x you know

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.679 
big difference is with p90x you know
again<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.519> different<00:03:02.849> kind<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.180> workout<00:03:03.510> so

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
again it's different kind of workout so

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.839 
again it's different kind of workout so
to<00:03:03.810> speak<00:03:04.049> with<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.489> still<00:03:05.639> at<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> pretty

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
to speak with and it's still at a pretty

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.849 
to speak with and it's still at a pretty
high<00:03:06.000> intensity<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.720> CrossFit<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.290> all<00:03:07.500> about

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
high intensity doing either a certain

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.199 
high intensity doing either a certain
number<00:03:10.859> of<00:03:11.069> repetitions<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.849> limited

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
number of repetitions in a limited

number of repetitions in a limited
amount<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.420> time<00:03:12.629> or<00:03:12.659> seeing<00:03:13.049> how<00:03:13.139> many

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
amount of time or seeing how many

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.410 
amount of time or seeing how many
repetitions<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.129> do<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:15.120> limited

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
repetitions you can do in a limited

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.949 
repetitions you can do in a limited
amount<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:15.780> time<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.349> again<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.459> just<00:03:17.959> much

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
amount of time and again it's just much

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.849 
amount of time and again it's just much
more<00:03:19.319> broad<00:03:19.799> than<00:03:20.690> p90x<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.139> not<00:03:22.650> saying

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
more broad than p90x would be not saying

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.199 
more broad than p90x would be not saying
there's<00:03:23.040> anything<00:03:23.069> wrong<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:23.489> p90x<00:03:23.940> again

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
there's anything wrong with p90x again

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.509 
there's anything wrong with p90x again
it's<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.419> fantastic<00:03:25.139> routine<00:03:25.500> whatever<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.280> do

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it's a fantastic routine whatever you do

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.390 
it's a fantastic routine whatever you do
I<00:03:26.760> think<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.329> really<00:03:27.540> will<00:03:27.919> enjoy<00:03:28.919> yourself

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
I think you really will enjoy yourself

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.390 
I think you really will enjoy yourself
but<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.150> thing<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:31.069> both<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.280> these

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
but the thing with both of these

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.069 
but the thing with both of these
exercise<00:03:32.909> routines<00:03:33.359> is<00:03:33.510> certainly<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.870> want

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
exercise routines is certainly you want

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.509 
exercise routines is certainly you want
to<00:03:34.199> consult<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.650> doctor<00:03:34.799> before<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.400> get

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
to consult a doctor before you get

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.399 
to consult a doctor before you get
started<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.780> find<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.079> which<00:03:37.199> one's

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
started on that to find out which one's

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.319 
started on that to find out which one's
right<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.949> but<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:38.699> think<00:03:38.819> if<00:03:39.180> you're

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
right for you but I think if you're

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.000 
right for you but I think if you're
looking<00:03:39.419> for<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.720> more<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.139> lifestyle<00:03:40.620> change

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
looking for a more of a lifestyle change

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.129 
looking for a more of a lifestyle change
that<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.090> might<00:03:42.269> want<00:03:42.479> to<00:03:42.510> take<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> look<00:03:42.959> at

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
that you might want to take a look at

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.420 
that you might want to take a look at
CrossFit<00:03:44.449> just<00:03:45.449> because<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.229> so<00:03:47.220> much

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
CrossFit just because it is so much

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.689 
CrossFit just because it is so much
different<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.989> really<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.310> seems<00:03:50.549> to

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
different and it really is that seems to

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.250 
different and it really is that seems to
be<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.909> sport<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.449> future<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.019> speak

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
be the sport of the future so to speak

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.149 
be the sport of the future so to speak
so<00:03:52.349> that's<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.620> my<00:03:52.739> opinion

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
so that's just my opinion

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.349 
so that's just my opinion
