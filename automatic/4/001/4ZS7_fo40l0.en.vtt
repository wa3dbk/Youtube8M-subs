00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
it so it could be a map result as well

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.840 
it so it could be a map result as well
for<00:03:14.709> example<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:15.459> write<00:03:15.640> an<00:03:15.760> O

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
for example so you can then write an O

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.640 
for example so you can then write an O
and<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.209> say<00:03:16.360> meet<00:03:16.600> me<00:03:16.630> here<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.110> then<00:03:17.410> send

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
and it to say meet me here and then send

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.199 
and it to say meet me here and then send
it<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:17.860> family<00:03:18.100> friend<00:03:18.459> for<00:03:18.610> example<00:03:19.060> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
it to a family friend for example and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.539 
it to a family friend for example and
that's<00:03:19.570> what<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.840> does<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.950> next<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.400> air

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
that's what that does so next on the air

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.610 
that's what that does so next on the air
command<00:03:21.850> wheel<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.390> s<00:03:22.540> finder<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.170> that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
command wheel is the s finder and that

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.410 
command wheel is the s finder and that
allows<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.950> search<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.430> anything<00:03:24.760> on<00:03:25.150> the

allows you to search for anything on the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.360 
allows you to search for anything on the
device<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.380> search<00:03:26.560> from<00:03:26.680> words<00:03:26.980> you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
device so you can search from words you

one<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.570> these<00:04:01.720> applications<00:04:02.320> here<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:02.620> you

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
one of these applications here so you

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.680 
one of these applications here so you
can<00:04:02.829> select<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.130> calculator<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.910> then<00:04:04.540> you

can select the calculator and then you
can<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:04.900> your<00:04:04.930> math<00:04:05.230> calculation<00:04:05.890> there<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.400> at

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
can do your math calculation there so at

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.949 
can do your math calculation there so at
the<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.180> 1000<00:04:10.320> x<00:04:11.320> 12<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.540> gives<00:04:13.690> me<00:04:13.780> to

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
the know 1000 x 12 so that gives me to

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.390 
the know 1000 x 12 so that gives me to
some<00:04:14.140> better<00:04:14.290> need<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:14.799> then<00:04:14.920> take<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.280> on

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
some better need I can then take that on

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.860 
some better need I can then take that on
and<00:04:15.609> carry<00:04:15.940> on<00:04:16.060> doing<00:04:16.209> what<00:04:16.390> I<00:04:16.419> wherever<00:04:16.750> I'm
