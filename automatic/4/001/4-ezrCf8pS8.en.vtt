00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.460
 Make a whirlpool 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.460
 f 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 me 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 future move search cab e to do mf 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.289
 Thank you for today 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 Speaking of Japanese model world 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:44.280
 Zero battle Yamato 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 I'm still ne around here is really the best that the other super transfer 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 It looks like it was created with full power and great . The previous Yamato has been over thirty years ago 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:01.010
 It is Yamato of the materials of that time and the hunting at present is completely different 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.510
 So this new Yamato is not completely used by old people 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.930
 Parent's turn to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:13.520
 It is in all it is 100% new parts and I made Tekikin type 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 Recently, I have come out with various photographs of Yamato and such things. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.450
 The environment is different from the old mountain 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.280
 I still do n't know completely , using all the resources I know at the moment 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.510
 Since the made 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.380
 Equivalent 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.719
 I think it will be something different from old days 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 A little over 350 minutes from a few years ago that I know from a variety of manufacturers 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:40.000
 There are various ways to come out, but there is a feeling that something has been waiting 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.770
 Well this is 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.190
 Because it is flagship literally 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:54.440
 It took me a year to make something that was comparable to the other maker 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:58.110
 This is one of the most true final appearances One is the most anti-aircraft gun 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.720
 This is small because it is the first morning 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.240
 Ship does not enter Well 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.640
 In here 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 Well, I didn't follow it . I see, I said it was a bit lighter . 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.069
 Ne 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:18.739
 Since that airplane that I think I flying machine was followed has issued a Katabaru on the way 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.340
 Although the battle seems to have put a great force in the course softening in particular that people like because participated 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.880
 this 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.250
 I'm getting rid of it, and if it 's a part of it, there's a pattern in the first part of the year 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.069
 Properly 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 I'm making the main Tamaki key or everything 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:38.790
 That's why there was no such thing 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.160
 After all, even on the 30 years I hear you do not make things a little more better Once passed document after this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.940
 The one who seems to pay attention to here 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.000
 Oh my words, this is another hobby show 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.460
 I think it is an item of 1st place 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.530
 This hit so Oh I think I wanted to put out a real Tamiya Fair 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.150
 Wow it really because I mon was Thermo are fighting otherwise gone to give me decorate 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.250
 Ne 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.549
 The detail is really great, so you can see various Echin parts from the beginning. 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 Yes there are many things that can not be expressed without etching 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.630
 It is this area really great 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.650
 is not it 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.049
 Great though 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 Finally, quite a waste It's Esso not do so fought even once the American battleship 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.640
 You used to use it 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.280
 But it is not changed phase to have passed 60 years there this war 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 Japanese Nakaya incense 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.110
 It's a dream It's an action battleship 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.180
 Of course there is Musashi among videos of that, well, maybe Musashi may also be able to show you 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.610
 I'm afraid but surprisingly 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.550
 In fact , it seems that Musashi is actually making lines 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.580
 Musashi is magnificent 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.990
 It since has been fighting with the United States fleet 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.020
 I have to put out that of course 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.090
 Just by all means, Yamato is better known 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.360
 It is why overwhelmingly Yamato Tsuyo 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.569
 I was a mother tongue morning two in elementary school, but with your mountain Naa that flickering 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.130
 It ends up with what became secret battleship Nishigawauchi 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.270
 Only people in the military know 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.090
 So it was a fifth-grade to war even as I 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:20.410
 Was the end stained by reduction of was I of Yamato 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.639
 Just seems so at the bottom of the sea too soon at that time 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:29.520
 It was good to not be able to table a and was what there be the root of it part experiment is regrettable 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:33.900
 Would've been waiting for that kind of fate also to have been left Well I heard cohabitation 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:39.770
 Since it has been designed so so very precise as was a look of Oh 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.770
 Thank you very much thank you very much
