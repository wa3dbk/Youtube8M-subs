00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
is probably going to be something that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.370 
is probably going to be something that
we<00:02:25.340> can't<00:02:25.610> post<00:02:25.880> or<00:02:26.090> comment<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.140> that's

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
we can't post or comment on so that's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.920 
we can't post or comment on so that's
quite<00:02:27.590> good<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.220> if<00:02:29.210> we<00:02:29.360> wanted<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.780> really

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
quite good and if we wanted to really

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.620 
quite good and if we wanted to really
delve<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.190> even<00:02:31.370> more<00:02:31.700> we<00:02:32.240> could<00:02:32.450> add

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
delve down to it even more we could add

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.750 
delve down to it even more we could add
something<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:33.830> well<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.610> that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
something like this as well so that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.450 
something like this as well so that
basically<00:02:34.910> says<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.410> URL<00:02:36.800> if<00:02:37.130> it's<00:02:37.310> got

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
basically says in the URL if it's got

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
times you can do it search on that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.310 
times you can do it search on that
username<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.250> say<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:01.670> example<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:03.020> actual

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320

bring<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.050> all<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.370> other<00:03:13.880> blogs<00:03:14.540> that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
bring up all the other blogs that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.270 
bring up all the other blogs that
they've<00:03:15.050> actually<00:03:15.230> commented<00:03:15.830> on<00:03:15.950> let's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
they've actually commented on let's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.610 
they've actually commented on let's
actually<00:03:16.490> find<00:03:16.910> an<00:03:17.060> example<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.260> let

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
actually find an example of that so let

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.120 
actually find an example of that so let
me<00:03:18.740> just<00:03:18.920> quickly<00:03:20.410> change<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.560> back<00:03:21.740> to<00:03:21.770> how<00:03:22.100> it

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
me just quickly change it back to how it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.920 
me just quickly change it back to how it
was<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.820> see<00:03:23.180> if<00:03:23.270> we<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.540> quickly<00:03:23.780> find

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
was and see if we can quickly find

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.900 
was and see if we can quickly find
something<00:03:24.620> very<00:03:24.830> quickly<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.400> before<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.760> in

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
something very quickly just before I in

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.100 
something very quickly just before I in
this<00:03:26.060> video<00:03:27.100> okay<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:28.160> for<00:03:28.640> example<00:03:28.810> say<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
this video okay so for example say the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.250 
this video okay so for example say the
name<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.710> we<00:03:30.830> wanted<00:03:31.490> to<00:03:31.820> piggyback<00:03:32.360> off<00:03:32.840> was

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
name that we wanted to piggyback off was

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.950 
name that we wanted to piggyback off was
Jason<00:03:33.980> hurts<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.850> would<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.210> pick<00:03:35.630> that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
Jason hurts and I would not pick that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.590 
Jason hurts and I would not pick that
name<00:03:36.650> particularly<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.550> reason<00:03:37.880> why<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.360> it's

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
name particularly the reason why is it's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.060 
name particularly the reason why is it's
probably<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.140> little<00:03:39.260> bit<00:03:39.440> common<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:39.860> want<00:03:40.010> to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
probably a little bit common you want to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.680 
probably a little bit common you want to
find<00:03:40.220> something<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.610> little<00:03:40.730> bit<00:03:40.910> unusual<00:03:41.120> like

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
find something a little bit unusual like

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.680 
find something a little bit unusual like
the<00:03:41.960> previous<00:03:42.380> example<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:43.010> l45<00:03:43.670> where<00:03:44.540> it's

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
the previous example I l45 where it's

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.210 
the previous example I l45 where it's
really<00:03:45.080> not<00:03:45.200> going<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.470> be<00:03:45.560> many<00:03:45.740> people<00:03:45.860> with

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
really not going to be many people with

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.890 
really not going to be many people with
that<00:03:46.460> same<00:03:46.880> name<00:03:47.150> where<00:03:47.360> it's<00:03:47.450> clearly<00:03:47.780> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
that same name where it's clearly a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.840 
that same name where it's clearly a
made-up<00:03:48.350> name<00:03:48.460> anyway<00:03:49.460> we'll<00:03:49.580> just<00:03:49.760> quickly

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
made-up name anyway we'll just quickly

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.300 
made-up name anyway we'll just quickly
put<00:03:50.240> this<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:51.050> see<00:03:51.350> what<00:03:51.950> will<00:03:52.100> come

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
put this in just to see what will come

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.380 
put this in just to see what will come
up<00:03:52.520> here<00:03:52.550> so<00:03:53.450> we'll<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.810> add<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.830> there

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
up here so we'll just add that in there

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.690 
up here so we'll just add that in there
okay<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.450> he's<00:03:56.840> only<00:03:57.020> really<00:03:57.580> commented<00:03:58.580> on

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
okay so he's only really commented on

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.150 
okay so he's only really commented on
