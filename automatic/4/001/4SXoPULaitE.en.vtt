00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.600 
okay I have a true alerts right here 49
no<00:03:01.890> 394<00:03:02.879> 18<00:03:03.329> but<00:03:04.110> unfortunately<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.799> one<00:03:05.069> is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
no 394 18 but unfortunately this one is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.050 
no 394 18 but unfortunately this one is
broken<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.709> won't<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:08.040> sounding<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.819> one

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
broken so it won't be sounding that one

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.089 
broken so it won't be sounding that one
so<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.049> one<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.409> is<00:03:10.530> pretty<00:03:10.680> similar<00:03:11.069> to

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
so this one here is pretty similar to

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.819 
so this one here is pretty similar to
the<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.230> did<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.439> strobe<00:03:13.799> light

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
the one we just did the strobe light

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.410 
the one we just did the strobe light
this<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.239> 4903<00:03:15.959> 94<00:03:16.860> zero<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:17.370> smart<00:03:18.150> stink

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
this is a 4903 94 zero one smart stink

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.000 
this is a 4903 94 zero one smart stink
stroke<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.019> smart<00:03:19.319> sequined<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.829> means

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
stroke but smart sequined really means

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.559 
stroke but smart sequined really means
is<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:21.599> need<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> smart<00:03:22.379> seek<00:03:22.560> module<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.569> make

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
is you need a smart seek module to make

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.270 
is you need a smart seek module to make
the<00:03:24.720> stroke<00:03:24.900> go<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.349> continuous<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.099> one

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the stroke go on continuous this one

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.089 
the stroke go on continuous this one
will<00:03:27.079> initially<00:03:28.079> stroke<00:03:28.349> once<00:03:28.620> when<00:03:29.010> you

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
will initially stroke once when you

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.910 
will initially stroke once when you
first<00:03:29.400> power<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.290> sound<00:03:31.290> off<00:03:31.409> again<00:03:31.709> when

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
first power it and sound off again when

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.759 
first power it and sound off again when
you<00:03:32.250> take<00:03:32.819> off<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> power<00:03:33.409> so<00:03:34.409> you'll<00:03:34.590> see

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you take off the power so you'll see

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.430 
you take off the power so you'll see
that<00:03:36.319> it's<00:03:37.319> in<00:03:37.500> there<00:03:37.650> 24<00:03:38.129> volt<00:03:38.340> VDC<00:03:39.299> alarm<00:03:40.170> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
that it's in there 24 volt VDC alarm so

00:03:40.440 --> 00:04:04.430 
that it's in there 24 volt VDC alarm so
continuous<00:04:00.379> this<00:04:01.379> one<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:01.889> is<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.099> 4903<00:04:03.440> 9422

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
continuous this one here is a 4903 9422

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.400 
continuous this one here is a 4903 9422
this<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.970> electro<00:04:07.970> electronic<00:04:08.970> work<00:04:09.410> so

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
this is the electro electronic work so

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.189 
this is the electro electronic work so
it<00:04:11.010> has<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> very<00:04:11.489> different<00:04:11.930> furnace<00:04:12.930> rule

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
it has a very different furnace rule

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.360 
it has a very different furnace rule
here<00:04:13.949> it's<00:04:14.220> more<00:04:14.519> discreet<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.039> again<00:04:17.310> is

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
here it's more discreet so this again is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.990 
here it's more discreet so this again is
a<00:04:17.789> smart<00:04:18.239> sync<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:19.130> previous<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:20.310> so

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
a smart sync like the previous one so

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:34.600

fifty one and this quiz that as we is my
loudest<00:05:52.979> fire<00:05:53.250> alarm<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:53.879> you<00:05:54.719> heard<00:05:55.050> those

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
loudest fire alarm so you heard those

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.279 
loudest fire alarm so you heard those
this<00:05:55.770> one<00:05:56.039> is<00:05:56.219> nothing<00:05:56.729> to<00:05:56.939> compare<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
this one is nothing to compare to the

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.230 
this one is nothing to compare to the
loudness<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.740> this<00:05:58.889> one<00:05:59.069> this<00:05:59.189> is<00:05:59.370> about<00:05:59.669> one

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
loudness of this one this is about one

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.689 
loudness of this one this is about one
hundred<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.810> ten<00:06:01.740> bells<00:06:01.949> at<00:06:02.310> ten<00:06:03.180> feet<00:06:03.419> so

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
hundred and ten bells at ten feet so

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.529 
hundred and ten bells at ten feet so
this<00:06:05.699> is<00:06:05.879> gonna<00:06:06.060> be<00:06:06.120> interesting

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
this is gonna be interesting

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.760 
this is gonna be interesting
all<00:06:06.870> right<00:06:07.020> now<00:06:07.229> I'm<00:06:07.379> greater<00:06:07.650> than

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
all right now I'm greater than

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:28.909 
all right now I'm greater than

we're gonna go to the ACS and those are
the<00:06:30.779> last<00:06:30.930> two<00:06:31.110> old<00:06:31.349> sound<00:06:32.210> now<00:06:33.210> for<00:06:33.449> the<00:06:33.539> last

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
the last two old sound now for the last

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.800 
the last two old sound now for the last
two<00:06:34.050> fire<00:06:34.710> alarms<00:06:35.009> that<00:06:35.099> I<00:06:35.129> have<00:06:35.370> is<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.849> simplex

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
two fire alarms that I have is a simplex

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.399 
two fire alarms that I have is a simplex
40<00:06:37.409> 50<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:37.770> a<00:06:38.279> forty<00:06:38.819> forty<00:06:39.210> I'm<00:06:39.479> powering

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
40 50 and a forty forty I'm powering

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.390 
40 50 and a forty forty I'm powering
this<00:06:40.680> on<00:06:40.889> a<00:06:40.919> very<00:06:41.430> AK<00:06:42.080> it<00:06:43.080> goes<00:06:43.229> up<00:06:43.379> 230<00:06:44.039> volts

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
this on a very AK it goes up 230 volts

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240 
this on a very AK it goes up 230 volts
alternating<00:06:44.849> current<00:06:45.529> so<00:06:46.529> I<00:06:46.560> have<00:06:46.800> it<00:06:46.919> pronged

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
alternating current so I have it pronged

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.040 
alternating current so I have it pronged
here<00:06:47.550> so<00:06:47.729> I'm<00:06:47.849> just<00:06:47.879> going<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.330> do<00:06:48.479> a<00:06:48.750> little

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
here so I'm just going to do a little

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.679 
here so I'm just going to do a little
short<00:06:49.319> continuous<00:06:49.800> burst

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 
short continuous burst

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.829 
short continuous burst
I'm<00:06:51.689> not<00:06:51.870> going<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.110> encode<00:06:52.349> three<00:06:52.650> because<00:06:52.979> I

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:53.839 
I'm not going to encode three because I

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.579 
I'm not going to encode three because I
don't<00:06:54.839> have<00:06:54.930> a<00:06:55.669> control<00:06:56.669> panel<00:06:57.050> so<00:06:58.050> hopefully

00:06:58.579 --> 00:06:58.589 
don't have a control panel so hopefully

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.740 
don't have a control panel so hopefully
