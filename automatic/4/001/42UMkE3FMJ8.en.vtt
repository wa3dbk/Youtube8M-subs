 [Bruce Norman: Teacher and Artist] 

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.371
 I am here with other people working on horses. 

00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.139
 But they really don't know how to explain things clearly. 

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.804
 But the first person to work with me 

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:33.770
 Changed my overall understanding of the work of horses, 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.571
 This person's name is Ray Hunt. 

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:38.655
 He is just an old cowboy. 

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.443
 Other cowboys trust him. 

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:45.143
 But he can control all the horses in a pretty good way. 

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.495
 He taught me to pay attention to the horses. 

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.236
 Of course, I also gave me some tools to control the horses. 

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:53.264
 He is a teacher who doesn't quite tell you what to do. 

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.265
 He just wants your attention. 

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.065
 But when you see him, 

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:00.341
 You know that you can't play him. 

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.263
 [laugh] 

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:02.762
 He knows what you know. 

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.428
 When riding a horse, for example, 

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.122
 You may fall into the wrong place at any time. 

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.134
 This horse will tolerate it. 

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:16.833
 But sometimes they just won't 

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.693
 Finally you will fall on the soil. 

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:20.739
 But Ray can always be in place, 

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:23.575
 You don't even want to hear it. 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.200
 A good teacher can always do it. 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.414
 If you want to learn, that is what you have to do. 

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:41.436
 A good teacher is like a good artist. 

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.434
 They face the most difficult part directly - 

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:47.170
 Painting or sculpture - 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.000
 Then directly in place. 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.200
 ["Model" (1998)] 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.801
 I know how to do it in my work, or hope that I know, 

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.065
 But I don't know what to do when I encounter a horse. 

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.634
 I can't find the connection. 

00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:04.002
 When I was still at school, Dibo was still teaching, and I was his assistant. 

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:05.433
 That's what Wean did. 

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.927
 He taught people how to pay attention. 

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.002
 This is what I saw him, 

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.540
 He teaches you how to pay attention to what you do - 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.895
 What is outside? 

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:20.771
 And this is... I think this is quite rare, unusual things, you know.
