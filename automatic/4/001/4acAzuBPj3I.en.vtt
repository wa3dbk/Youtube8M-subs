00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello very good we are all in a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.460
 new video today I bring you some of the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.890
 first mods that have updated for 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.719
 minecraft 97.2 today I'm back have 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 expected x raid mod 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 on the official page of the x-raid mont no 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 you go against the authorization you do not go 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 to find on any of the pages 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 that motorcycle discharge is usually 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 more a friend has passed me what is the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 file of the installer of the x-raid mod 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 for this new version and well I have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 decided to upload it so you can 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 download it directly so yes yes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.219
 I'm not going to explain a little bit that is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.870
 the x raid mod for the one who does not know 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.700
 but well imagine that many of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.780
 you will already know them with the quiz 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 raymond is a mod 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.110
 to say it in some way in check that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.810
 it serves for mode 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.190
 for single or multiplayer mode 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:52.060
 so pressing is pressing the x key 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.860
 of the keyboard because as you can see we will be able to 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.910
 see all the minerals that are inside 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.830
 of what it is from the world of minecraft 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.440
 so this mode is checked by 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.210
 say it in some way since in the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.370
 individual mode you save a little but 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 in multiplayer mode then you can 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 inflate tea diamonds and everything and good 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.860
 and get you a bunch of shit 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.910
 in front of your friends without knowing that as 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.410
 what is getting clear then the mod 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.870
 in the previous person they used to bring 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.450
 how good by hitting the zeta 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.220
 the cedh the keyboard you could upload the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.810
 lighting and such but good you see that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.510
 this version has not yet updated or 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 is not 100% mod but good yo 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.570
