00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.529
 3 classes and multimedia merger reduced 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.089
 let's continue 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.210
 with our first leg match next to the pike 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.270
 who sow 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.030
 in this building 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.770
 the 97 praet 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.160
 I tried everything 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.220
 without the use of embrapa 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.450
 two pre-defined multimedia moves marines 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.700
 we painted park 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 but he moved normally congested 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 say right to left 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.200
 in this video next we'll do what the ridiculous hold shift 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 and let's make a coni spring will jump higher 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280
 without remote fan 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.870
 he will stay on the platform when he gets near the stepson was the sobral 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.869
 for you 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.040
 we visited 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.960
 the objects 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.370
 fan 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.240
 the most important thing is the gear 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.740
 in our programming is a crisis 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 that will be hidden 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 and if you want to wind then you'll understand why 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.120
 peter kinloch spring part 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 these buildings - said your command is close 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.230
 suffers 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.620
 which is what it is static 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.300
 but on the frame 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.330
 the Spanish 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 It's certain that the move 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.040
 he is alert 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.539
 thus 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.399
 the program in the following way from the set of the system is thus 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 every game but same period 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 Your hero collides with a brunette 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.729
 then justice 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.729
 naima health was for the sprint 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.919
 if animations were determined 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.199
 the victory the animation seems tokyo 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.199
 we will leave 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.099
 she is already guarding her movement 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.669
 when I got to the inter 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.279
 in the place of diogo now is to do ours and will jump higher 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.839
 gustavo lins as the creation of a routine 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.479
 already days of programming 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:09.019
 taking advantage of the condition 14 environmental police engineer angop o sprinter 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.700
 everything already I chose 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.769
 animation band mill 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.729
 for that movement 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.079
 he also accounting adjustment 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.519
 Jose Dos Campos 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 meningitis 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.720
 like the people in the class in class 2 the counter is gravity 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.089
 if it is minus 20 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.539
 will move - 21 seconds 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.209
 here in the hoof up because negative numbers in the programming up to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.279
 next 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.279
 first day of physical activity to the left 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.479
 so it goes - 20 up 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.479
 lets test 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.709
 that's personal 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.649
 The normal 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
 program of great repercussion on chile 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.669
 I promise they will request it here. 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.199
 click the salmon icon 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.199
 but taking advantage of the collision 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.139
 to answer 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.139
 look that personal grace 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 beyond the walk 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.659
 the serious problem 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.759
 now let's make our hero who will suffer from para 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.349
 the place is on top of that same year 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 janelle schedule 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.990
 What you've already created 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.099
 the highest 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 if they have been ventilated 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.159
 and for this to follow our tips on how that asset 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.449
 after subtracting 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.139
 2 the gravity counter 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.139
 let's try them 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.129
 I told you guys 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.849
 when you get the pulse down there 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.919
 it goes up to the highest physics is unrealistic 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
 the impression is only under pressure 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.009
 - I want to increase the speed when pressing security 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.830
 the shift key 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.400
 they can have recovered fully convinced 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.259
 but I'll try to fix it 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.259
 running at normal speed 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.189
 volunteers normal speed 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.189
 Now I'm going to run this way. 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.129
 they voted much faster 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.249
 if the insured is full 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:16.249
 running for months 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:20.309
 but stopped there 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.259
 Good how do you do this? 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.259
 pib down the condition that says when you 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.889
 safe to right and leandro keys 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.889
 two more as we play ball 12 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.469
 simpson also the punishment 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:39.969
 beverage 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.689
 When did you leave? 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.789
 even with old 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.789
 and much value the chips for easier 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.349
 I was afraid to stop but this activity 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.029
 is to put more speed 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:09.059
 lets test 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.360
 in this class you learned with the mother put the speed of your v8 

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.639
 make a basic spring 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.689
 do a show 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:34.689
 living more 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.729
 the next classes 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.779
 more than one hundred reais 

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:40.959
 good luck percent
