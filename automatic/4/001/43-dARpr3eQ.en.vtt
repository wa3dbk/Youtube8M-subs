00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.780
 some complain about the windows 8 interface 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 others adapt to innovations 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.860
 and yet make the transition 3 and 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.140
 completely satisfied with the changes 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.420
 but the architects of interfaces and brands 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 jay bast is not offering its solution 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.979
 how to fix the eight 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.170
 improvised windows 8 2j 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.550
 bases on several rules 1 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.590
 microsoft should submit 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.720
 unified ecosystem and store 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.550
 applications based on industry second 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 do so to meter and live tiles 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.930
 were useful interface components 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.180
 3 operating system should work 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.310
 equally good with touch input 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.230
 so with mouse control and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.730
 keyboard and finally microsoft need 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.319
 accept the fact that users 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 desktop version does not need optimization 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 interface for touch input 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 tablet owners don't need anything 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.000
 classic desktop and desktop 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.010

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.019
 j offers to separate both options. 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.280
 transition between them by pressing 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.049
 one button with everything 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.060
 applications developed for windows 8 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.069
 must work flawlessly with both 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.140
 Variants of course easier to say than 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.570
 do but the demonstration draws its 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.340
 external brevity more news 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.970
