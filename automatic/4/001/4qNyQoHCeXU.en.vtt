type look also with this gold treatment
makes<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.320> actual<00:00:41.190> case<00:00:41.370> stand<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.820> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
makes the actual case stand out really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
makes the actual case stand out really
nicely<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> we're

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
nicely what we're going to do is we're

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.990 
nicely what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> separate<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.460> pieces<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
going to separate the two pieces and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
going to separate the two pieces and
then<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.390> our<00:00:45.660> phone<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.170> we'll<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.440> how

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
then put our phone in so we'll see how

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.830 
then put our phone in so we'll see how
all<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> cutouts<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> line<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> insert

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
all the cutouts of line so to insert

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.060 
all the cutouts of line so to insert
your<00:00:49.020> phone<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.500> case<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.890> always

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
your phone into the case I always

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
your phone into the case I always
recommend<00:00:50.250> separating<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> actual<00:00:51.750> ring

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
recommend separating the actual ring

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
recommend separating the actual ring
from<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> actual<00:00:53.010> case<00:00:53.219> itself<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.699> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
from the actual case itself it just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
from the actual case itself it just
makes<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.180> much<00:00:54.480> easier<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.870> put<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
makes it so much easier to put it in and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
makes it so much easier to put it in and
all<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.399> you'll<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.809> your

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
all you do is you'll just put in your

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
all you do is you'll just put in your
phone<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:59.100> TPU<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.730> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
phone just like this it's TPU so it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
phone just like this it's TPU so it's
going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> give<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> then

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
going to be it's going to give and then

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
going to be it's going to give and then
once<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.059> going
