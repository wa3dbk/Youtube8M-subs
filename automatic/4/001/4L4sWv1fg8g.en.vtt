pretty<00:00:31.560> attacking<00:00:32.130> camp<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.360> not

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
pretty attacking camp and then it's not

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
shooting in journal was really really

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
good the only really down start this guy

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
good the only really down start this guy
was<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> fact<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.780> he<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.049> weak<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.619> am<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
was the fact that he was weak but am I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
was the fact that he was weak but am I
really<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.790> guy<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> handle

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really do for this guy if you can handle

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
really do for this guy if you can handle
a<00:01:09.840> week<00:01:10.049> center<00:01:10.320> forward<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.400> do

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
a week center forward then I really do

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
a week center forward then I really do
think<00:01:11.640> he<00:01:11.820> could<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> job<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> false<00:01:13.049> an

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
think he could do a job in a false an

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.480 
think he could do a job in a false an
answer<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:13.890> his<00:01:14.070> passing<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
answer for that because his passing is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399 
answer for that because his passing is
awesome<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> his<00:01:15.390> shooting<00:01:15.750> his<00:01:15.869> decent<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
awesome and his shooting his decent you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
awesome and his shooting his decent you
can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> clips<00:01:17.250> you'll<00:01:17.670> happily

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
can see that in the clips you'll happily

really<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.329> especially<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
really really good but especially the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
really really good but especially the
one<00:01:46.079> who's<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> robot<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.549> really

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
one who's in the robot is really really

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
one who's in the robot is really really
effective<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.810> here

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
effective and as you can see here

supporting<00:01:49.619> play<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.460> well<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> F

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
supporting play really really well and F

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
supporting play really really well and F
guess<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.740> an<00:01:52.829> open<00:01:53.100> net<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
guess or it kind of is an open net to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
guess or it kind of is an open net to
goalkeeper<00:01:53.640> could<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.450> reached<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.899> may<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
goalkeeper could have reached it may be

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
goalkeeper could have reached it may be
but<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.280> pool<00:01:56.460> play<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.790> really

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but yeah as the pool play was really

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
but yeah as the pool play was really
really<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.810> once<00:01:58.020> again<00:01:58.110> flick

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
really good you can see once again flick

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
really good you can see once again flick
through<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.250> Martins<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.850> he<00:02:00.090> finishes

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
through from Martins and he finishes

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
through from Martins and he finishes
really<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.110> nicely<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
really really nicely and that's one of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
really really nicely and that's one of
the<00:02:02.250> best<00:02:02.340> things<00:02:02.549> about<00:02:02.640> even<00:02:03.420> though<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the best things about even though it is
