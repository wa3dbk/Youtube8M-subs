00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.569

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.000
 in July 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 the shins beside pounds 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 The hand cards can be old 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.640
 post this abandoned in this blog post already 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 qatar it shouldn't lose too much on the radio either 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 mpe pay attention where traces 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.430
 that is the very best 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.880
 and now stood behind the names 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.920
 With music 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.750
 it was too late 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 also stood here 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 kwo 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 we stood there talking how i am there it is incredible 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.099
 something for me 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.529
 No, not that 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.979
 I don't find you there 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.209
 and that was 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.109
 he visits 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.189
 stand the first 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.189
 by making the club 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
 that thought 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.019
 it was beautiful 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 if it is good that you have turtle tree on your own 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
 also got parquet and top 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.069
 from schaik where I had known him, however, too 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.199
 just to build something 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.409
 let them come a little while 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.519
 for the picture 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.529
 because I have to take it with him and this is where the counter stands 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 and then it is iperen 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.339
 I actually came to the conclusion 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:24.489
 to the worst 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.330
 that letter says that's really something I can't handle a 100 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.259
 what you say 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.259
 way to wait 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.580
 so lucky you must also get a pleasant first speed 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.299
 the beautiful texel is also going well 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.679
 that can't be cris 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.679
 I aim this kind 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.199
 nice and varied really nice and relaxing 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.749
 there they are inventing 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.499
 and this fate 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:14.779
 that's how it works 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.059
 only I am I stand I really can not handle it 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.569
 It is also his tips for the most I don't deceive you 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.800
 the dender 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.810
 with such a ds has 50 that all goes fine and that 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.599
 it's about fine 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.139

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.809
