but you see I put a little electric

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.979 
but you see I put a little electric
motor<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:44.360> just<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.840> i

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989

motor on there just because I what i
like<00:00:46.230> electric<00:00:46.530> better<00:00:46.739> than<00:00:46.890> gas<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.430> put

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
like electric better than gas so put

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.080 
like electric better than gas so put
that<00:00:48.030> pick<00:00:48.710> as<00:00:49.710> far<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> camera<00:00:50.399> goes<00:00:50.730> i

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that pick as far as the camera goes i

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.500 
that pick as far as the camera goes i
took<00:00:51.930> apart<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> components<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.370> old<00:00:53.610> flip

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
took apart the components of an old flip

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
took apart the components of an old flip
cam<00:00:54.690> ultra<00:00:55.280> one<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> standard<00:00:56.760> def

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
varieties and mounted it inside the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
varieties and mounted it inside the
cabin<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> airplane<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.300> I'll<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.660> show

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
cabin of the airplane but I'll just show

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.619 
cabin of the airplane but I'll just show
you<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.539> mounted<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you down here first how I mounted it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.440 
you down here first how I mounted it
they<00:01:04.140> look<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.450> mirror

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
they look right here there's a mirror

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.730 
they look right here there's a mirror
that<00:01:06.600> sort<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> swept<00:01:09.080> forward<00:01:10.080> towards<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that sort of swept forward towards the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.550 
that sort of swept forward towards the
front<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> airplane<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.560> lens

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
front of the airplane up here is a lens

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
front of the airplane up here is a lens
because<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> camera<00:01:14.939> itself<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> actually

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
because the camera itself is actually

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
because the camera itself is actually
mounted<00:01:16.220> flat<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.000> bottom<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
mounted flat on the bottom of the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
mounted flat on the bottom of the
fuselage<00:01:18.869> underneath<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> battery<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.460> hold

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
fuselage underneath the battery to hold

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460 
fuselage underneath the battery to hold
it<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.820> place<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> course<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it in place and then of course the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.710 
it in place and then of course the
mirror<00:01:23.070> helps<00:01:23.850> orient<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> direction

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
mirror helps orient the direction

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
mirror helps orient the direction
forward<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.070> editing<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.549> post<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
forward and then in editing in post I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
forward and then in editing in post I
have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.240> flip<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> video<00:01:27.780> back<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> other

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
have to flip the video back the other

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
have to flip the video back the other
way<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.520> things<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> other

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
way so that things like the other

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
way so that things like the other
orientation<00:01:32.009> isn't<00:01:32.310> left-to-right<00:01:33.060> or

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
orientation isn't left-to-right or

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
orientation isn't left-to-right or
right-to-left<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.840> whatever<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.700> I'm

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
right-to-left or whatever so here I'm

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
right-to-left or whatever so here I'm
going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> ring<00:01:37.590> off

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
going to I'm going to take the ring off

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
going to I'm going to take the ring off
and<00:01:37.829> show<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> got<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.530> camera

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and show you how I got the camera

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.810 
and show you how I got the camera
mounted<00:01:41.310> inside<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.950> inside<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> fuselage

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.610 

maybe<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.540> should<00:01:47.750> take<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:47.930> other<00:01:48.230> bands<00:01:48.410> off

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
maybe I should take it other bands off

00:01:48.620 --> 00:02:02.230 
maybe I should take it other bands off

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.440 
I'll go ahead and pull that out here
looks<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:32.900> still<00:02:33.110> running<00:02:34.270> forgot<00:02:35.270> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
looks like it's still running forgot to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
looks like it's still running forgot to
stop<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:40.300> anyway<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.709> yeah<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.739> took<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.010> flip

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
stop it anyway so yeah I took the flip

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.830 
stop it anyway so yeah I took the flip
cam<00:02:43.370> components<00:02:43.880> out<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.239> foot<00:02:44.390> cam<00:02:44.600> case

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
cam components out of the foot cam case

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.140 
cam components out of the foot cam case
and<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.190> obviously<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:46.910> very

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
and you see that it's obviously not very

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.240 
and you see that it's obviously not very
much<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.570> terms<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.959> weight<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:49.070> just<00:02:49.190> a

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
much in terms of weight it's just a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.540 
much in terms of weight it's just a
little<00:02:49.370> PC<00:02:49.760> board<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.360> screen<00:02:51.370> also<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.519> I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
little PC board and a screen also what I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.580 
little PC board and a screen also what I
did<00:02:52.820> was<00:02:53.180> since<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.630> foot<00:02:53.780> cam<00:02:53.989> only<00:02:54.350> takes

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
did was since the foot cam only takes

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.530 
did was since the foot cam only takes
two<00:02:54.769> double-a<00:02:55.070> batteries<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.730> couldn't<00:02:56.510> very

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
two double-a batteries I couldn't very

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.080 
two double-a batteries I couldn't very
well<00:02:56.840> install<00:02:57.800> double-a<00:02:58.220> battery<00:02:58.550> case<00:02:58.760> in

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
well install double-a battery case in

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.860 
well install double-a battery case in
the<00:02:59.600> plant<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.440> took<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:01.040> simple<00:03:01.850> double<00:03:02.780> a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
the plant so I took a simple double a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.620 
the plant so I took a simple double a
battery<00:03:03.290> holder<00:03:03.560> at<00:03:03.680> Radio<00:03:03.890> Shack<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.850> I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
battery holder at Radio Shack and I

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.720 
battery holder at Radio Shack and I
soldered<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.230> on<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.769> battery<00:03:06.980> leads<00:03:07.250> on

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
soldered it on to the battery leads on

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.910 
soldered it on to the battery leads on
the<00:03:07.940> foot<00:03:08.150> cam<00:03:08.860> itself<00:03:11.500> probably<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.799> that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the foot cam itself probably see that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.940 
the foot cam itself probably see that
okay<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:14.090> zoom<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> video<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.290> so

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
okay I can zoom in on the video but so

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.520 
okay I can zoom in on the video but so
anyway<00:03:16.040> that's<00:03:16.340> how<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.519> works<00:03:17.410> with<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
anyway that's how that works with the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.860 
anyway that's how that works with the
foot<00:03:18.739> cam<00:03:18.950> down<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:20.720> hole

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
foot cam down there in that little hole

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.710 
foot cam down there in that little hole
and<00:03:21.310> points<00:03:22.310> forward<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:23.299> how<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.480> get<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and points forward it's how I get the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.740 
and points forward it's how I get the
video<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.170> work<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.470> airplane

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
video it's work on the airplane

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.940 
video it's work on the airplane
hopefully<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:26.840> some<00:03:26.870> point<00:03:27.049> I'll<00:03:27.440> use<00:03:27.769> this

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
hopefully at some point I'll use this

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.140 
hopefully at some point I'll use this
camera<00:03:28.220> right<00:03:28.459> here<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.670> I'm<00:03:28.760> holding<00:03:28.910> to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
camera right here that I'm holding to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.780 
camera right here that I'm holding to
shoot<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:29.420> video<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:30.019> shoot<00:03:30.470> HD<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:31.610> my

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
shoot this video and shoot HD of my

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.010 
shoot this video and shoot HD of my
flights<00:03:32.799> see

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
flights see

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.110 
flights see
happens<00:03:34.670> course<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.730> know<00:03:35.850> none<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> these

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
happens course I know none of these

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.730 
happens course I know none of these
flights<00:03:36.390> are<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.660> exciting<00:03:37.110> until<00:03:37.380> actually

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
flights are that exciting until actually

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.400 
flights are that exciting until actually
crash<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.360> hopefully<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.510> won't<00:03:39.600> happen<00:03:39.720> so

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
crash but hopefully that won't happen so

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.160 
crash but hopefully that won't happen so
there<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.490> go<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:42.330> how<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.630> put<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.110> camera

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
there you go that's how I put my camera

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.070 
there you go that's how I put my camera
in<00:03:43.530> Miami
