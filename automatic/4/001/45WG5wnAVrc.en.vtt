first<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.789> all<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:28.240> was<00:00:28.480> not<00:00:28.720> because<00:00:29.170> it<00:00:29.500> was

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
first of all it was not because it was

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.950 
first of all it was not because it was
kind<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:29.920> late<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.310> game<00:00:30.400> player<00:00:30.960> most

point however Toshiba has historically

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.250 
point however Toshiba has historically
especially<00:00:39.370> with<00:00:39.640> netbooks<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.690> other<00:00:40.870> items

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
especially with netbooks and other items

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.689 
especially with netbooks and other items
have<00:00:41.440> been<00:00:41.470> kind<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:41.949> late<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.220> game<00:00:42.250> and

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
have been kind of late to the game and

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.280 
have been kind of late to the game and
it<00:00:42.790> take<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.970> while<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:43.600> perfect<00:00:43.900> our

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
it take a while to perfect our

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.380 
it take a while to perfect our
technology<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.549> I<00:00:45.610> think<00:00:45.640> that<00:00:46.030> that's

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
technology and I think that that's

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.990 
technology and I think that that's
pretty<00:00:46.780> much<00:00:46.930> what<00:00:47.530> happened<00:00:47.920> right<00:00:48.070> here<00:00:48.339> now

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
pretty much what happened right here now

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.840 
pretty much what happened right here now
that's<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.269> Shiba<00:00:49.540> thrive<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:51.250> wonderful

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.119 
that's a Shiba thrive is a wonderful
tablet<00:00:52.030> one<00:00:52.869> that<00:00:53.049> I<00:00:53.080> use<00:00:53.379> my<00:00:53.530> classroom<00:00:53.979> all

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
party is that the tablet is sizably

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.360 
party is that the tablet is sizably
larger<00:01:07.140> thicker<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.619> it's<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.799> 10.1

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
larger thicker that it is it's a 10.1

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.490 
larger thicker that it is it's a 10.1
screen<00:01:09.790> but<00:01:10.060> as<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.390> see<00:01:10.600> it's<00:01:10.780> fairly

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
screen but as you can see it's fairly

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.100 
screen but as you can see it's fairly
thick<00:01:11.910> um<00:01:12.910> this<00:01:13.390> has<00:01:13.510> been<00:01:13.720> kind<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.050> a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
thick um this has been kind of a

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.210 
thick um this has been kind of a
non-issue<00:01:14.290> for<00:01:14.710> me<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.860> let<00:01:14.950> me<00:01:15.010> take<00:01:15.190> a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
non-issue for me and let me take a

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.040 
non-issue for me and let me take a
little<00:01:15.340> bit<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.490> reasons<00:01:15.790> why<00:01:15.910> first<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:16.930> all

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
little bit of reasons why first of all

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.980 
little bit of reasons why first of all
this<00:01:17.620> tablet<00:01:17.950> feels<00:01:18.460> very<00:01:18.940> very<00:01:19.030> sturdy<00:01:19.810> in

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
this tablet feels very very sturdy in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.110 
this tablet feels very very sturdy in
your<00:01:20.080> hands<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:21.130> if<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.460> if<00:01:21.580> you're<00:01:21.730> working

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
your hands and if you if you're working

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.700 
your hands and if you if you're working
with<00:01:22.240> any<00:01:22.420> tablet<00:01:22.720> 10<00:01:23.170> inches<00:01:23.440> are<00:01:23.560> bigger

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
with any tablet 10 inches are bigger

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.610 
with any tablet 10 inches are bigger
you're<00:01:24.580> probably<00:01:24.910> using<00:01:25.720> two<00:01:25.960> hands<00:01:26.200> anyway

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
you're probably using two hands anyway

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.190 
you're probably using two hands anyway
so<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.980> don't<00:01:27.130> feel<00:01:27.430> like<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.730> a<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:29.170> know

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
so I don't feel like this is a you know

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.870 
so I don't feel like this is a you know
substitute<00:01:29.710> for<00:01:29.920> weight<00:01:30.070> training<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.700> think

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
substitute for weight training I think

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.610 
substitute for weight training I think
it's<00:01:31.180> it's<00:01:31.420> fine<00:01:31.660> it<00:01:31.990> feels<00:01:32.260> good<00:01:32.440> in<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
it's it's fine it feels good in the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.080 
it's it's fine it feels good in the
hands<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.370> were<00:01:33.460> put<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.730> hand<00:01:33.970> to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
hands and we were put in hand to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.180 
hands and we were put in hand to
students<00:01:34.480> to<00:01:34.570> use<00:01:34.690> in<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:34.870> classroom<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.530> think

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
students to use in my classroom I think

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.680 
students to use in my classroom I think
this<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.400> probably<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.090> best<00:01:37.210> way<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.450> go

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
this is probably the best way to go

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.660 
this is probably the best way to go
another<00:01:38.620> thing<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.830> really<00:01:38.950> like<00:01:39.100> about<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.400> too

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
another thing I really like about it too

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.950 
another thing I really like about it too
is<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.940> back<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.420> that's<00:01:40.540> why<00:01:40.690> I'm<00:01:40.780> showing

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
is the back and that's why I'm showing

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.750 
is the back and that's why I'm showing
that<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.409> right<00:01:41.560> now<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:42.400> has<00:01:42.580> this

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
that to you right now it has this

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.440 
that to you right now it has this
