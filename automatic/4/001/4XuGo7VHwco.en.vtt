00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.450
 This video shows the insertion of points using coordinate 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.490
 let's first limit the area of ​​paper where we have to push 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.369
 limits 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.439
 and we set the lower left corner at the point of this process 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.369
 the top corner 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.369
 at point 2 703 cent 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.659
 holden zhou 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.429
 must everything 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.789
 to display on the screen the limits that we have established if you place the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.829
 cursor in the corner ingest left we will observe 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 a status bar 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 to the left of the coordinates 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.930
 - one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.650
 5 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.030
 and if we go to the corner at approximately position 700 300 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080
 let's give their corner 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.210
 let's draw a square 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 because in vineyard 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.970
 and we use absolute Cartesian coordinates first 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 from the point if the merchant 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 the next point on the right 200 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.280
 the next point without units up 200 200 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.780
 and excellent point 7 on the left 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 200 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 to close the room 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.490
 we draw the same square with Cartesian coordinates 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.860
 relative 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.929
 by limia 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.679
 we draw the first point with absolute coordinates the coordinates 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.650
 300 100 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 ica from here we use reactivates the following @ 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 light right half 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 following 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.940
 in horizontal and 100 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.510
 upwards 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.520
 The next 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.869
 - one hundred to go to the left and 0 to vertical 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.689
 the next instead of being close 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.909
 @ 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.229
 - one hundred 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.679
 so that it goes down vertically 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.469
 we ended up late 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.840
 let's draw last that the square employing crowned by arias 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:23.850
 federative 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.880
 the vintage 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.709
 first point we put it with 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.029
 as a matter 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.029
 the sentence to Syria 500 100 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.109
 and then relative polar we would approve 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.109
 one hundred for the distance 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.799
 lower star 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.389
 for the angle 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.939
 The next @ 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.749
 for the distance 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.929
 - 90 for agulo 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.929
 we introduce in this case 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.769
 and 180 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 and the next one would be steal 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.449
 270 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:08.949
 I finished side
