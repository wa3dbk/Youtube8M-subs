testing<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:59.009> discover<00:01:59.399> how<00:01:59.729> much<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.390> lake

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
testing to discover how much this lake

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590 
testing to discover how much this lake
and<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.290> support<00:02:01.880> find<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and actually support find out if it can

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
and actually support find out if it can
if<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.829> feasible<00:02:05.100> from<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.610> healthy

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
if it's really feasible from the healthy

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
if it's really feasible from the healthy
support<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> human<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.659> walking<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> but

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
support of human was walking on it but

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.100 
support of human was walking on it but
through<00:02:08.160> his<00:02:08.190> experiments<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> prosthetic

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
through his experiments the prosthetic

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.980 
through his experiments the prosthetic
has<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.830> taken<00:02:11.190> off

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
has really taken off

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.950 
has really taken off
so<00:02:12.680> much<00:02:12.890> fun<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.370> lot<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.700> fun<00:02:13.910> yeah<00:02:14.060> usually<00:02:14.630> we

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
so much fun a lot of fun yeah usually we

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.510 
so much fun a lot of fun yeah usually we
have<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.080> big<00:02:15.290> oven<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:15.890> put<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:16.250> all<00:02:16.370> in

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
have a big oven you just put them all in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.130 
have a big oven you just put them all in
there<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.910> oven<00:02:17.210> it's<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> whole<00:02:17.960> thing

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
there in the oven it's the whole thing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.680 
there in the oven it's the whole thing
up<00:02:18.260> after<00:02:18.920> nearly<00:02:19.160> two<00:02:19.520> years<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.880> work<00:02:20.210> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
up after nearly two years of work the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
up after nearly two years of work the
team<00:02:20.990> has<00:02:21.170> reached<00:02:21.470> their<00:02:21.800> goal<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.310> making<00:02:22.730> an

team has reached their goal of making an

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.510 
team has reached their goal of making an

inexpensive comfortable working below

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.730 
inexpensive comfortable working below
the<00:02:25.880> knee<00:02:26.030> prosthetic<00:02:26.510> usually<00:02:27.500> any

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the knee prosthetic usually any

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.560 
the knee prosthetic usually any
prosthetic<00:02:28.550> will<00:02:28.700> cost<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> amputee

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
prosthetic will cost the amputee

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.380 
prosthetic will cost the amputee
thousands<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> dollars<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.820> prosthetic

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
thousands of dollars but this prosthetic

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.440 
thousands of dollars but this prosthetic
made<00:02:32.810> by<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:32.990> BYU<00:02:33.440> research<00:02:33.920> team<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.120> easy

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
made by a BYU research team is so easy

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.540 
made by a BYU research team is so easy
to<00:02:35.690> make<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.380> can<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.800> done<00:02:36.980> in<00:02:37.160> an<00:02:37.250> apartment

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
to make it can be done in an apartment

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.320 
to make it can be done in an apartment
with<00:02:38.390> an<00:02:38.570> oven<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.590> few<00:02:39.890> simple<00:02:40.280> tools<00:02:40.730> this

with an oven and a few simple tools this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.760 
with an oven and a few simple tools this
is<00:02:41.480> where<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.690> magic<00:02:41.840> happens<00:02:42.410> for<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
is where the magic happens for the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.800 
is where the magic happens for the
majority<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.640> life<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> project<00:02:44.390> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
majority of the life of the project a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.020 
majority of the life of the project a
kitchen<00:02:45.500> was<00:02:45.770> their<00:02:45.980> workplace<00:02:46.430> stick<00:02:47.000> that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
kitchen was their workplace stick that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.840 
kitchen was their workplace stick that
in<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.390> oven<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.440> PVC<00:02:49.010> pipe<00:02:49.280> becomes

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
in the oven the PVC pipe becomes

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.060 
in the oven the PVC pipe becomes
moldable<00:02:50.630> as<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.050> heats<00:02:51.200> up<00:02:51.410> let's<00:02:51.770> see<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:51.950> we

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
moldable as it heats up let's see if we

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.920 
moldable as it heats up let's see if we
over<00:02:52.280> baked<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.940> see<00:02:53.090> how<00:02:53.210> fast<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.690> cuts

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
over baked it can see how fast it cuts

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.480 
over baked it can see how fast it cuts
to<00:02:54.200> let<00:02:54.530> me<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.770> crunch<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> water

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
to let me just crunch it in the water

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.810 
to let me just crunch it in the water
and<00:02:55.940> they'll<00:02:56.060> be<00:02:56.240> nice<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.510> hard<00:02:57.730> there<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and they'll be nice and hard there you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.910 
and they'll be nice and hard there you
go<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.360> socket<00:02:59.870> however<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.500> more

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
go the socket however is the more

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.860 
go the socket however is the more
difficult<00:03:01.130> part<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.820> project<00:03:02.090> we've<00:03:02.720> been

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
difficult part of the project we've been

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.870 
difficult part of the project we've been
testing<00:03:03.590> out<00:03:03.830> different<00:03:04.040> ideas<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.610> make<00:03:04.730> them

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
testing out different ideas to make them

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.430 
testing out different ideas to make them
more<00:03:05.000> comfortable<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.840> got<00:03:05.990> some<00:03:06.020> foam

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
more comfortable like we got some foam

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.470 
more comfortable like we got some foam
it<00:03:06.980> has<00:03:07.130> come<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> long<00:03:07.490> way<00:03:07.850> from<00:03:07.910> when<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.450> was
