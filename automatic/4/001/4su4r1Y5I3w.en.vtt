00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.490
 i 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.580
 this is the popular sports model 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.889
 galaxy s 5 exclusively for sprint 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.170
 but except for a couple of differences is 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.519
 practically identical as they are I am 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.770
 vanessa hand orellana for cinema in 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.830
 Spanish today I have the first look 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.420
 to the galaxy s 5 samsung sports do not create 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.090
 which is a new phone but rather 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.980
 a modification to the s 5 the design does not 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.199
 it's wrong but sporty does not have 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.960
 much besides being aquatic as well 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.180
 that s 5 well in blue and this red that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.820
 I have here with plastic cover and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.160
 hollows a little bigger also 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.960
 they feel slightly heavier and it seems 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.820
 be thicker with this edge of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.219
 plastic will notice that it has buttons 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.260
 physical in the front and does not come 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.510
 with the fingerprint sensor that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.700
 it seems a great disadvantage to me 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.980
 to specifications is how to repeat the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.710

 megapixels that is among the best in the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 market and the front of 2 megapixels 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.860
 also if it comes with the rhythm sensor 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.869

 interesting option if you like the design

 different but the personal thing would stay 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.930
 with the original s 5 for being more compact 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.740
