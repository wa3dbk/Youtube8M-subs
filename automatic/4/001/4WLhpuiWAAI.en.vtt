00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello here is moritz personal trainer 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 and doctor of venlo 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.059
 today I present and demonstrate 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 you the finn maximum at the 5 as already 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 to be seen directly at first sight 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 not only visually a very appealing 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 strength training device but also 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 Functionally of particularly high value 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 Most of all, m5 impresses with its two 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.980
 running independently of each other 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 weight blocks with 96 kilo total 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 Resistance one side per side 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 easy adjustability and safe 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.700
 anchoring results from the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 so-called magnetic spins one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.129
 Rarity with many fitness devices 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 I think 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.980
 and this one very safe and clean 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.489
 gently anchoring the weight blocks of the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.770
 Weight adjustment enable the M5 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 is very high quality processed very 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.239
 stable ball bearing in total one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.660
 cable load capacity of 1000 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.520
 kilo 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 that means here is really at all 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 no danger given that the device 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.250
 is overloaded but rather that her on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 your limits are coming and just times 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.150
 again, what does it really mean? 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 to train properly 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 especially high quality processing 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.479
 The upholstery with a handle 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.799
 take out and in any position 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.720
 of exercising here an optimal 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.030
 Support of the whole body 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 guarantee 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 especially for beginners the important 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 easy adjustment the the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 M5 offers some red buttons 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 or lever to find the one with 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.750
 handle a very simple idea 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 of positions in the range of m5 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.479
 enable 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.189
 so i can get ahead with one 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.500
 handle between both straighteners and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.630
 choose flexor exercises and can 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 fit to each body size 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.369
 seat backs to the appropriate 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.509
 body position and even on 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.549
 Malpractice in the area of 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.200
 Movement apparatus adapt to here too 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.720
 make permanent corrections 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.040
 can 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.600
 multi-faceted and multifunctional 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 the m5 only because we here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 have manifold handle options 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.430
 they are also very different 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.240
 combine let the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.030
 means a close 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.700
 Brother grip rod a small sz 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.530
 rod small stirrups as well as a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 Classic aluminum deduction rod 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.920
 allow a very differentiated 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.239
 Training as many as possible 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 muscles of the body 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.989
 The rods are very light 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 high quality and are also a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.069
 hang so it was not here 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.690
 possibility gives big noise to produce 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.099
 a very decisive advantage in the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.180
 area of home training not around here 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.380
 to upset the neighbors too much 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.489
 Special feature had already mentioned at the beginning 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.080
 two independently 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.269
 working weight blocks 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.220
 this means in personal training in the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.750
 training with several people just at 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.920
 You can get partner training here 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 independent work 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 for me as a personal highlight that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.350
 super set training what i like in mine 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.120
 Training routine very often on walls 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.980
 For example, I can do without big ones 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.810
 circumstances of the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.239
 classic exercises bench press for the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.209
 chest muscles and the triceps without 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.799
 Change switch and immediately to the country 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.470
 so we really change here 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.630
 only little time is lost and me 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.230
 highly effective large muscle groups of the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.880
 can train entire body as well 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.859
 important exercises for the hull or 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.799
 smaller muscles for the calf muscles 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.500
 are feasible here at the m5 so 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.700
 exists here an extension bank the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.709
 I'm looking for an appropriate one 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.380
 body height can adjust and excellent 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.780
 the lower back with back stretch 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.549
 Musculature can be a tremendous exercise 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.530
 important exercise for any athlete 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.450
 value it puts a stable function 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.489
 in the area of ​​the trunk muscles 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.350
 and to prevent back complaints 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.150
 yes and here even therapeutically 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.769
 Act that something I like in 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.569
 to carry out my personal training 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.910
 yes my train because of course 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.049
 optimal training of the stabilizing 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.060
 to ensure muscles 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.400
 You wonder how I train them 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.459
 commodity quite simply for this there is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.109
 a nice outsourcing in the area of 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.530
 salt I put myself here on it 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.760
 an additional weight over the cables 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.410
 Generated and can easily do this 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.410
 carry out a lift 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.180
 Overall a really, very, very 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.070
 functional device with a lot 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.260
 smooth motion sequences 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.020
 excellent processing very easy 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.310
 to adjust the weights optimally 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.870
 customizable seating positions and one 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.450
 Exercise diversity in the fitness area

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.440
 suitable for the professional due to the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 many handle possibilities and the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 possibility just this independent 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.470
 Superset training also perform too 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.540
