which<00:00:43.440> lead<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> fact<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.280> they're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
which lead to the fact that they're

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
which lead to the fact that they're
probably<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.510> fake<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.110> going

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
probably going to be fake I'm not going

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
probably going to be fake I'm not going
to<00:00:46.440> say<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> hundred<00:00:46.890> percent<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.610> probably

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to say a hundred percent but probably

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
to say a hundred percent but probably
going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.480> fake<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
going to be fake so first of all if we

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.049 
going to be fake so first of all if we
have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> images<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:51.030> see

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
have a look at the images we can see

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
have a look at the images we can see
that<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> text<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.710> identical<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that the text is actually identical to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
that the text is actually identical to
an<00:00:53.910> announcement<00:00:54.239> post<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.260> last<00:00:55.649> year

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
an announcement post to use last year

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
an announcement post to use last year
for<00:00:56.489> black<00:00:56.699> ops<00:00:56.969> 2<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.270> last<00:00:57.719> year<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.930> actually

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
for black ops 2 so last year we actually

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
for black ops 2 so last year we actually
got<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> poster<00:00:58.800> telling<00:00:59.129> us<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.879> were

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
got a poster telling us when we were

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
got a poster telling us when we were
going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> hear<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:00.899> news<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
going to hear the first news about the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
going to hear the first news about the
game<00:01:01.949> before<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.820> any<00:01:03.000> sort<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> post<00:01:03.809> or

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
game before we got any sort of post or

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
game before we got any sort of post or
any<00:01:04.110> sort<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> date<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> coming<00:01:05.850> anywhere

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
any sort of date and coming anywhere

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
any sort of date and coming anywhere
near<00:01:06.180> close<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.170> release<00:01:07.530> date<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> black

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
near close to the release date of black

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
near close to the release date of black
ops<00:01:08.880> 2<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.900> leads<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.590> points<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
ops 2 so this leads up to two points a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
ops 2 so this leads up to two points a
the<00:01:11.700> fact<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.180> getting<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.420> release

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the fact that we're getting a release

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
the fact that we're getting a release
date<00:01:12.780> opposed<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.070> early<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.520> means<00:01:15.240> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
date opposed to so early on means it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850 
date opposed to so early on means it's
probably<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.840> through<00:01:15.900> fake<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> B<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
probably going through fake and B the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
probably going through fake and B the
fact<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> text<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> layout<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
fact that the text and the layout of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
fact that the text and the layout of the
text<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.130> similar<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.090> poster<00:01:21.509> last

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
text is so so similar to the poster last

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
text is so so similar to the poster last
year<00:01:22.110> means<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> somebody<00:01:23.220> his<00:01:23.430> point<00:01:23.670> has

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
year means that somebody his point has

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
year means that somebody his point has
come<00:01:23.970> along<00:01:24.180> copied<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> layout<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> last

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
come along copied the layout of last

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469 
come along copied the layout of last
year's<00:01:25.830> poster<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.549> each<00:01:27.119> year<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
year's poster because each year of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
year's poster because each year of
course<00:01:27.720> Call<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> Duty<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> developed<00:01:28.619> by

course Call of Duty is developed by

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
course Call of Duty is developed by
different<00:01:28.920> guys<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.729> marketing<00:01:30.240> material<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
different guys the marketing material is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
different guys the marketing material is
going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.020> different<00:01:31.290> every<00:01:31.590> year<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
going to be different every year so the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
going to be different every year so the
fact<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.549> similar<00:01:32.850> leans<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:33.659> towards

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
fact it's so similar leans more towards

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
fact it's so similar leans more towards
the<00:01:34.320> fact<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.740> fake<00:01:34.979> than<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> fact<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the fact it's fake than the fact that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
the fact it's fake than the fact that
it's<00:01:36.090> actually<00:01:36.509> real<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.079> things<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's actually real so that's things that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's actually real so that's things that
are<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:37.710> important<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.790> note<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> talk<00:01:39.630> me

Neversoft is actually given any sort of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.430 
Neversoft is actually given any sort of
credit<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.990> points<00:02:47.990> towards<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.230> fact

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
credit so this points towards the fact

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.750 
credit so this points towards the fact
that<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.680> definitely<00:02:49.070> fake<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.580> should

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that it's definitely fake you should

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.750 
that it's definitely fake you should
have<00:02:49.940> Infinity<00:02:50.450> Ward<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.810> there<00:02:51.050> alongside

have Infinity Ward on there alongside

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.740 
have Infinity Ward on there alongside
Neversoft<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.210> fact<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.630> been

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
Neversoft and the fact that it's been

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.350 
Neversoft and the fact that it's been
excluded<00:02:54.560> means<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:55.700> believe<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.180> person

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
excluded means that I believe the person

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.000 
excluded means that I believe the person
that's<00:02:56.630> created<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.110> false<00:02:57.380> image<00:02:57.770> has

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that's created this false image has

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.340 
that's created this false image has
overlooked<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.700> fact<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> big<00:03:00.050> error

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
overlooked that fact and is a big error

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.770 
overlooked that fact and is a big error
within<00:03:01.010> these<00:03:01.400> poster<00:03:01.970> images<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.690> then

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
within these poster images and then

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.540 
within these poster images and then
finally<00:03:03.290> probably<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> biggest<00:03:03.830> error<00:03:04.250> of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
finally probably the biggest error of

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.210 
finally probably the biggest error of
them<00:03:04.820> all<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.270> actually<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.260> data<00:03:06.470> itself<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
them all is actually the data itself and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.710 
them all is actually the data itself and
if<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.430> go<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.700> look<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.240> 11th<00:03:08.570> of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
if you go and look up the 11th of
