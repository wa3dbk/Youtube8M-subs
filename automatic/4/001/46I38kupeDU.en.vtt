well<00:00:24.810> what's<00:00:24.990> interesting<00:00:25.199> about<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> NGP<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
well what's interesting about the NGP it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
well what's interesting about the NGP it
actually<00:00:26.490> has<00:00:26.640> fewer<00:00:27.269> buttons<00:00:27.510> fewer

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
actually has fewer buttons fewer

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140 
actually has fewer buttons fewer
physical<00:00:28.619> buttons<00:00:28.920> than<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.699> DualShock

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
physical buttons than the DualShock

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
physical buttons than the DualShock
controller<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
controller right but what we do have is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
controller right but what we do have is
the<00:00:32.850> touchscreen<00:00:33.329> both<00:00:33.690> front<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.200> rear<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the touchscreen both front and rear so

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160 
the touchscreen both front and rear so
we're<00:00:35.309> trying<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> incorporate<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
we're trying to incorporate that in a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.720 
we're trying to incorporate that in a
lot<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> unique<00:00:37.710> ways<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
lot of unique ways there's a lot of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
lot of unique ways there's a lot of
ideas<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.390> how<00:00:39.540> touch<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.410> incorporated

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
ideas of how touch can be incorporated

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.869 
ideas of how touch can be incorporated
or<00:00:41.879> how<00:00:42.030> six<00:00:42.510> axis<00:00:42.930> tilt<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.129> it's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
or how six axis tilt you know and it's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.430 
or how six axis tilt you know and it's
just<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.809> us<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> matter<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
just you know for us it's a matter of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
just you know for us it's a matter of
getting<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.950> getting<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> feature<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.940> there

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
getting it getting that feature in there

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
getting it getting that feature in there
and<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.360> trying<00:00:48.629> playing<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> over

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and just trying playing it over and over

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
and just trying playing it over and over
does<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.850> work<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.870> because

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
does this really work you know because

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.630 
does this really work you know because
the<00:00:52.199> triangle<00:00:52.559> button<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.280> sort<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> an

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the triangle button you know sort of an

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
the triangle button you know sort of an
abstract<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.360> saying<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> pick<00:00:54.960> up

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
abstract way of saying you know pick up

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
abstract way of saying you know pick up
this<00:00:55.230> object<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.010> open<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.340> door<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.579> kick

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
you can see them start moving over to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.590 
you can see them start moving over to
the<00:01:48.800> touch<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.340> start<00:01:49.700> using<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.000> more<00:01:50.300> so

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the touch and start using that more so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.080 
the touch and start using that more so
the<00:01:50.780> ability<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.620> integrate<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.820> stick

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
the ability to like integrate to stick

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.570 
the ability to like integrate to stick
motion<00:01:53.540> with<00:01:53.900> touch<00:01:54.170> with<00:01:54.620> six<00:01:54.950> axis<00:01:55.340> and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
motion with touch with six axis and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.710 
motion with touch with six axis and
having<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.880> just<00:01:56.030> fit<00:01:56.180> as<00:01:56.300> long<00:01:56.390> as<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.600> feels

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
having it just fit as long as it feels

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.750 
having it just fit as long as it feels
natural<00:01:57.020> as<00:01:57.290> long<00:01:57.410> as<00:01:57.470> it's<00:01:57.590> fun<00:01:57.830> frankly<00:01:58.550> I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
natural as long as it's fun frankly I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.130 
natural as long as it's fun frankly I
think<00:01:59.060> players<00:01:59.360> are<00:01:59.510> going<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.660> like<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.840> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
think players are going to like it and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.210 
think players are going to like it and
just<00:02:00.350> keep<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.650> mind<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:00.920> what<00:02:01.070> you're

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
just keep in mind that what you're

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.520 
just keep in mind that what you're
seeing<00:02:01.460> right<00:02:01.550> now<00:02:01.760> is<00:02:01.940> our<00:02:02.390> first<00:02:02.810> generation

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
seeing right now is our first generation

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.770 
seeing right now is our first generation
in<00:02:03.710> gp-engine<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.150> can<00:02:05.360> do<00:02:05.510> in<00:02:05.690> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
in gp-engine what we can do in the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.450 
in gp-engine what we can do in the
future<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:06.380> think<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.010> only<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.340> be

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
future I think it's only going to be

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.700 
future I think it's only going to be
limited<00:02:07.640> by<00:02:07.970> our<00:02:08.110> imaginations<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.380> what<00:02:09.590> we

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
limited by our imaginations and what we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.080 
limited by our imaginations and what we
can<00:02:09.860> come<00:02:10.010> up<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.760> think<00:02:10.970> that's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
can come up with and I think that's

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.280 
can come up with and I think that's
probably<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.420> most<00:02:11.570> important<00:02:12.080> thing<00:02:12.200> about

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
probably the most important thing about

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.340 
probably the most important thing about
NGP<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.610> really<00:02:13.850> does<00:02:14.150> enable<00:02:14.480> game

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
NGP is it it really does enable game

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.590 
NGP is it it really does enable game

developers to you know create whatever

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.090 
developers to you know create whatever
it<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.870> mean<00:02:18.050> you've<00:02:18.200> seen<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> huge<00:02:18.890> variety

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
it I mean you've seen the huge variety

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.680 
it I mean you've seen the huge variety
that<00:02:19.490> we're<00:02:19.640> at<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> show<00:02:20.030> today<00:02:20.209> it's<00:02:20.510> like

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that we're at the show today it's like

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.479 
that we're at the show today it's like
anything<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.560> imagine<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
anything you can imagine you can do you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.979 
anything you can imagine you can do you
can<00:02:22.640> do<00:02:22.760> fun<00:02:22.970> little<00:02:23.120> short<00:02:23.390> games<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.900> do

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
can do fun little short games you can do

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.050 
can do fun little short games you can do
big<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.860> know<00:02:24.980> console<00:02:25.430> action<00:02:25.850> games

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
big you know console action games

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.660 
big you know console action games
equally<00:02:26.930> well<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.350> think<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:28.130> has<00:02:28.489> us

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
equally well I think that's what has us

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.970 
equally well I think that's what has us
excited
