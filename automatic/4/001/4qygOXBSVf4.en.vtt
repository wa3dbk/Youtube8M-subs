00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 wants to come to the fans tonight today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.509
 sunday and today are among others 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.509
 crew around you and turn on a lot of fun 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.410
 first of all heart speed june I have yes 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 meanwhile almost everything said there was 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 yes massive startup problems not constant 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.990
 framerate and performance slumps and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.220
 Now you have a bit of media 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
 and the fear that I play that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.699
 everything on Tuesday repeated because on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
 second december will be the open 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.689
 world racing game crew is, however, of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 another ubisoft developer studio 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 That's why you have to look 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 if that will really be so lead 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 designer tugged at hassan has to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 also expressed again and said one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.620
 will not do this bumpy start 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.270
 to repeat 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 one believes in stability and performance 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 of your own title and is there really 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.239
 good things and will do anything to you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 to ensure a smooth start 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 moreover, as I said, the past 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 of course there were different beta test 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 and that's why everything went because of that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 wonder if on tuesday the server 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.859
 this huge onslaught of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 probably from the part of the player 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 then will be held well 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 and yes I hope that's all good 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570
 works well and well over the stage 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 running 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.990
 concentrate is this number now has one 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 new concept rich in species too 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.140
 uncharted 4 publishes this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 High resolution picture shows the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.090
 protagonists from uncharted four nation 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 3 on an island or a beach 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.509
 surrounded by a tropical storm 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.039
 that does not look all that has now 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.149
 however on other concept arts in 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.070
 the past, too 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.810
 but fans are of course always 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 very yes they are always happy when it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 that's because the developers are so 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 naughty dog always keeps it that way 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 bit covers the last 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 For example, there was a teaser trailer 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.679
 hope for the last e3 yes and now 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.360
 the fans on further material 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 to uncharted 4 on the coming 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080
