00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
did really well early on but a one round

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
did really well early on but a one round
of<00:00:39.480> mercenary<00:00:40.050> creeps<00:00:40.350> coming<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.129> sonic

we'll<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.329> how's<00:00:48.600> oz<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> try<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
we'll see how's oz is going to try to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
we'll see how's oz is going to try to
respond<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.399> matchup<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.629> see

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
respond in this matchup as you now see

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
respond in this matchup as you now see
that<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> wisp<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.620> moving<00:00:53.039> across<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.579> map

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that the wisp is moving across the map

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
that the wisp is moving across the map
and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> guess<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.570> trying<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> find<00:00:55.469> figure

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and I guess it's trying to find figure

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
and I guess it's trying to find figure
out<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.160> his<00:00:56.309> opponent<00:00:56.850> has<00:00:57.090> started<00:00:58.079> now

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
out where his opponent has started now

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
out where his opponent has started now

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
not one hundred percent sure perhaps try

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
not one hundred percent sure perhaps try
to<00:01:42.329> build<00:01:42.750> off<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.200> ancient<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> war<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:44.070> over

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to build off an ancient of war down over

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
to build off an ancient of war down over
here<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> sight<00:01:45.780> on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here or get a little bit of sight on

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.249 
here or get a little bit of sight on
exactly<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> happening<00:01:48.079> Archer<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
exactly what is happening Archer of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
exactly what is happening Archer of
actually<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> ancient<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> war<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> just

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
actually the ancient of war is just

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
actually the ancient of war is just
attacking<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.570> no<00:01:51.869> Archer<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.560> joined<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.009> on

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
attacking and no Archer has joined in on

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.080 
attacking and no Archer has joined in on
the<00:01:53.310> fight<00:01:53.490> yet<00:01:53.670> that's<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.909> rather

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the fight yet that's a rather

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.080 
the fight yet that's a rather
interesting<00:01:54.799> no<00:01:55.799> Archer<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.399> ever<00:01:56.610> trained

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
interesting no Archer was ever trained

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030 
interesting no Archer was ever trained
so<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> demon<00:01:58.320> hunter<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.979> be

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so the demon hunter is going to be

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.069 
so the demon hunter is going to be
creeping<00:01:59.430> alongside<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.630> ancient<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
war and that is it as you now see an

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
war and that is it as you now see an

and<00:05:37.699> I'm<00:05:38.699> really<00:05:39.060> not<00:05:39.240> sure<00:05:39.300> who<00:05:39.779> has<00:05:40.020> the

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
and I'm really not sure who has the

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.110 
and I'm really not sure who has the
advantage<00:05:40.680> I<00:05:40.860> would<00:05:41.340> say<00:05:41.490> that<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.729> demon

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
advantage I would say that the demon

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.719 
advantage I would say that the demon
hunter<00:05:42.389> has<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.690> advantage<00:05:43.050> right<00:05:43.199> now<00:05:43.259> and

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
hunter has the advantage right now and

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.309 
hunter has the advantage right now and
sonic<00:05:44.729> has<00:05:44.819> the<00:05:44.940> advantage<00:05:45.270> just<00:05:45.599> because<00:05:45.750> he

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
sonic has the advantage just because he

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.709 
sonic has the advantage just because he
is<00:05:46.440> level<00:05:46.800> two<00:05:47.039> but<00:05:47.669> that's<00:05:47.849> not<00:05:47.969> much<00:05:48.479> of<00:05:48.509> an

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
is level two but that's not much of an

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.140 
is level two but that's not much of an
advantage<00:05:48.839> when<00:05:49.139> you<00:05:49.379> when<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:50.190> ultimately

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
advantage when you when you ultimately

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.070 
advantage when you when you ultimately
think<00:05:51.389> about<00:05:51.569> it<00:05:51.629> you<00:05:51.690> can<00:05:51.810> see<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:51.930> this
