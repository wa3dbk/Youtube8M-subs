00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
rendering we also improved the 3d

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
rendering we also improved the 3d
navigation<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:52.170> till<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> had<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
navigation then till now you had to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010 
navigation then till now you had to
left-click<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.789> hold<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.300> trackball<00:00:54.750> over

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
left-click and hold the trackball over

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650 
left-click and hold the trackball over
here<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.649> move<00:00:55.829> her<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.280> space<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.390> felt

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
here to move her out in space we felt

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
here to move her out in space we felt
that<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> come<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.859> better

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that we had to come up with a better

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
that we had to come up with a better
solution<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
solution for this so now you just have

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
solution for this so now you just have
to<00:01:01.620> right-click<00:01:02.280> anywhere<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> studio

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to right-click anywhere in the studio

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.679 
to right-click anywhere in the studio
area<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.530> rotate<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:05.610> inside<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
area and can rotate around inside the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.200 
area and can rotate around inside the
space<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.340> should<00:01:08.580> speed<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
space we think this should speed up your

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.460 
space we think this should speed up your
workflow<00:01:09.420> tremendously<00:01:11.810> for<00:01:12.810> example<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
workflow tremendously for example you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
workflow tremendously for example you
you<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> change<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> light<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you want to change the light in the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
you want to change the light in the
front<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.110> now<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> also<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

change<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> light<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.930> now

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
change the light in the back it's now

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350 
change the light in the back it's now
very<00:01:19.619> simple<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> right-click<00:01:20.490> where<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> are

very simple to right-click where you are

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
very simple to right-click where you are
and<00:01:21.689> rotate<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.380> space<00:01:22.650> where<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and rotate the space where you have the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
and rotate the space where you have the
better<00:01:23.700> angle<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> adjust<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> other<00:01:25.200> light

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
better angle to adjust the other light

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.350

quick tip when you cameras in behind the
light<00:04:21.549> stand<00:04:21.909> and<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:22.630> blocking<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.469> side

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
light stand and it's blocking the side

light stand and it's blocking the side
to<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.490> model<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:26.110> push<00:04:26.380> this<00:04:26.620> button

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
to your model you just push this button

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.940 
to your model you just push this button
and<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.850> light<00:04:28.030> stand<00:04:28.330> will<00:04:28.690> be<00:04:28.870> hidden<00:04:29.140> this

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
and the light stand will be hidden this

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.070 
and the light stand will be hidden this
was<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.400> simplest<00:04:30.760> solution<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.690> we<00:04:31.870> could

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
was the simplest solution that we could

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.230 
was the simplest solution that we could
come<00:04:32.320> up<00:04:32.500> with<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.460> there<00:04:33.700> are<00:04:33.790> so<00:04:34.030> many

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
come up with because there are so many

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.500 
come up with because there are so many
boom<00:04:34.570> stands<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.670> ceiling<00:04:36.670> constructions

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
boom stands and ceiling constructions

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.070 
boom stands and ceiling constructions
out<00:04:38.200> there<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:39.100> we<00:04:39.450> said<00:04:40.450> we<00:04:40.810> couldn't

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
out there that we said we couldn't

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.200 
out there that we said we couldn't
replicate<00:04:41.440> every<00:04:42.100> one<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.340> them<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:43.030> we<00:04:43.180> just

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
replicate every one of them so we just

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.350 
replicate every one of them so we just
hide<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.320> stand<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.920> this<00:04:45.280> should<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.820> the

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
hide the stand and this should be the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.140 
hide the stand and this should be the
boom<00:04:46.570> stand<00:04:46.840> for<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.640> another<00:04:48.640> feature<00:04:48.970> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
boom stand for you another feature I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820 
boom stand for you another feature I
wanted<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.510> show<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.780> are<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.350> catch<00:04:50.530> lights

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
wanted to show you are the catch lights

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.500 
wanted to show you are the catch lights
