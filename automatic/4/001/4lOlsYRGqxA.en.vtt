00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
just multiply the amounts that I'm using

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.780 
just multiply the amounts that I'm using
so<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.290> first<00:00:42.500> thing<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:42.769> need<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.070> boil<00:00:43.460> some

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
so the first thing I need to boil some

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.030 
so the first thing I need to boil some
eggs<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.659> filling<00:00:45.019> station<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.769> now<00:00:45.980> we

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
eggs so the filling station and now we

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.500 
eggs so the filling station and now we
just<00:00:46.250> bring<00:00:46.489> these<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> boil<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.420> let

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
just bring these to the boil and let

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.360 
just bring these to the boil and let
them<00:00:47.780> simmer<00:00:48.050> for<00:00:48.350> approximately<00:00:48.980> six<00:00:49.309> to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
them simmer for approximately six to

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.880 
them simmer for approximately six to
eight<00:00:49.550> minutes<00:00:49.820> using<00:00:50.600> pre<00:00:50.989> boiled<00:00:51.379> eggs<00:00:51.620> is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
eight minutes using pre boiled eggs is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.040 
eight minutes using pre boiled eggs is
probably<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.250> best<00:00:52.460> idea<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.239> if<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.870> know

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
probably the best idea so if you know

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.479 
probably the best idea so if you know
you're<00:00:54.199> going<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.350> be<00:00:54.469> making<00:00:54.680> them<00:00:54.980> boil<00:00:55.280> them

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
you're going to be making them boil them

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.510 
you're going to be making them boil them
the<00:00:55.609> day<00:00:55.760> before<00:00:55.969> right<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:57.260> once<00:00:57.559> ur<00:00:57.770> coil

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the day before right so now once ur coil

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.330 
the day before right so now once ur coil
I'll<00:00:59.030> just<00:00:59.269> drain<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.690> water<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.410> if<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:01.160> are

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
I'll just drain the water and if you are

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.910 
I'll just drain the water and if you are
in<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.640> hurry<00:01:01.789> just<00:01:02.059> throw<00:01:02.390> them<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:02.809> some<00:01:03.739> ice

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
in a hurry just throw them in some ice

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.160 
in a hurry just throw them in some ice
water<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.729> they<00:01:05.239> cool<00:01:05.479> down<00:01:05.539> faster<00:01:06.380> oh<00:01:08.170> okay

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
water so they cool down faster oh okay

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.840 
water so they cool down faster oh okay
so<00:01:09.229> once<00:01:09.619> you've<00:01:09.770> boiled<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.340> peel<00:01:10.610> those

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
so once you've boiled and peel those

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.130 
so once you've boiled and peel those

you can either just put it on in sheets
for<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:43.880> might<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:45.229> slice<00:01:45.619> mine<00:01:45.950> up<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:47.119> make

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
for I might just slice mine up to make

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.929 
for I might just slice mine up to make
it<00:01:47.450> easier<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.890> buy<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.130> into<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.549> sandwich

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
it easier to buy it into the sandwich

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.340 
it easier to buy it into the sandwich
width<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:51.500> they<00:01:51.560> let<00:01:51.829> us<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.100> top<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
width and now they let us on top of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.870 
width and now they let us on top of
