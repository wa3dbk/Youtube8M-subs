00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
notice right up here towards the

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.120 
notice right up here towards the
northern<00:01:09.299> areas<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.920> spot<00:01:11.100> right

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
northern areas this little spot right

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.590 
northern areas this little spot right
here<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.640> part<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> Red<00:01:12.150> River<00:01:12.180> and

here that is part of the Red River and
that<00:01:12.630> flows<00:01:12.960> north<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.500> different<00:01:13.890> watershed

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that flows north so different watershed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.710 
that flows north so different watershed
then<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.150> where<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> snow<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
then take a look at where the snow is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
then take a look at where the snow is
still<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.220> exact<00:01:17.610> same

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
still and it's right in that exact same

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
still and it's right in that exact same
spot<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:18.840> areas<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> two

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
spot some of these areas have up to two

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
spot some of these areas have up to two
feet<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.520> snow<00:01:20.549> still<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.900> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
feet of snow still in them and now it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
feet of snow still in them and now it's
warming<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.159> we're<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.430> be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
warming up so that's what we're gonna be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
warming up so that's what we're gonna be
seeing<00:01:23.610> significant<00:01:24.330> flooding<00:01:24.630> here

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
seeing significant flooding here

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.100 
seeing significant flooding here
temps<00:01:25.979> getting<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> 70s<00:01:27.240> today's<00:01:27.600> still

few days so that snows gonna rapidly
melt<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.070> water<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.640> flows<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.210> slowly

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
melt this water then flows very slowly

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.560 
melt this water then flows very slowly
to<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> north<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:34.590> slow<00:01:35.570> sloping

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to the north that's a very slow sloping

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
to the north that's a very slow sloping
area<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.250> seeing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
area right here so we're gonna be seeing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
area right here so we're gonna be seeing
this<00:01:38.579> river<00:01:38.939> crest<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.320> 38<00:01:40.950> feet

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this river crest right around 38 feet
