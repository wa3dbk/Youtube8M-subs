00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 today more than ever it is clear to me that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 mexico is the favorite to conquer the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.639
 title of the gold cup is the great 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.410
 favorite to conquer today will remember 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.200
 surely hernán el bolillo gómez 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hernán Darío Gómez the question that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 I did at the press conference that was 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.260
 the last one who thought about the belief 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.779
 popular that he had to face 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 mexico and arbitration today surely 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.730
 will remember me today there will also be a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 reflection mexico has really been the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 better or has many shots and has 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 many arrivals but it has really been 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.920
 the best one has needed of course 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.360
 arbitral errors which leads me to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 another reflection is Mexico's fault is 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 inconceivable that mexico wins yes or is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 fault of arbitration at the end of accounts 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.039
 here we are to comment don josé 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.820
 luís sanchez hello how are you good 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.829
 good nights everyone 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.440
 first 25 minutes it would seem that Mexico 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.280
 I could win some good coast step 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.500
 rich there are no answers from the bench in the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.070
 25 minute when they eject the player or 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 26 was to what I told you what 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.000
 we want to do there give the answer in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.009
 the bank there you had to do the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.440
 superiority there you had to go for the 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.110
 match to answer way way to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.540
 message remember what we talked about and not 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 nothing happened until the 46th minute that comes 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 the change they take to a central one that already 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.310
 it does not open anymore they do not do the two against one 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 they no longer take advantage of the band they never never 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.080
 saw that mexico after the expulsion 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.060
 out more then what happened to us happened to us 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.820
 it also happened to us that we had to 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 come you have to sign there is not one single 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.320
 person who says it was the criminal 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.420
 then without mexico passes loses the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 football loses again loses soccer 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.560
 in credibility in organization in in 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.020
 all these messages that you have to 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.970
 give or have to enact a sport 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.820
 as big as this football 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.690
 loses totally and not mexico gmexico 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.420
 totally 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.090
 the other little step that could be given the day 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.190
 from today 3 to back 3 to back because 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.650
 he does not play football today he does not know 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.930
 take advantage of nothing and there is no response from the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.180
 banking there is no revulsive that right now 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.290
 is when we talk about it I said and 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.320
 herrera 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.420
 I did not tell you I told you also the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 prognosis truth 21 I did not expect that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.820
 out in this way that 21 so that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.380
 mexico can feel proud of this 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.780
 triumph is Mexico's fault 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 it seemed the game really was better 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 in this meeting 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.760
 first of all good night to the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.760
 Rochelle and good night at the table 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.850
 There's spicy football and I'm called 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 attention and really listen and what 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.560
 pity what a pity personally happens 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 in Mexico in the 2002 World Cup 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.730
 wrong the referee against Spain and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.100
 no Korean said anything the hand of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.540
 maradona no Argentine said anything the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.540
 hand of thierry henrry against ireland 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.850
 no Frenchman said anything the rude 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710
 arbitral error in 66 that gives the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.570
 world title to england no 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.489
 English said nothing and neither did 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.170
 Mexican, I understand that Panamanians 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.900
 they complain they have everything 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.880
 they have absolutely every reason to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 complain about an arbitration error but that 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.390
 all Mexicans and through those who 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 they are in those who have said what I'm going 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.330
 to suggest what I'm going to mention that 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.430
 say that it is corruption that is a robbery 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.350
 which is a shame of the footballers 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.050
 Mexicans of the Mexican technical staff 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.209
 of Mexican football I do not understand or 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.310
 if they are wrong against mexico they are things 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 of football is an arbitral error but if 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.500
 the error favors mexico then if 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.590
 comes all this cascade of versions 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 cheap populists without any foundation 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.790
 for me Mexico at times if he played very 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.650
 good to football today the prizes 25 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.910
 minutes until the roof is expelled 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.890
 by the way for me if it 's expulsion 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.959
 because it is an attack with fist 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
 face of the matriz Rodríguez as well as 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.940
 should the candle also had to be 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.470
 gone those minutes if playing by the bands 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.209
 the first intention comes in line with 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.310
 get to the beards of the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.440
 goalkeeper and shoot even if I go wide 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.239
 it's not playing with quality then I do not know 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.160
 what are we talking about after he changes 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.680
 everything after the story changes comes the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.890
 expulsion and there yes with all respect for 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.380
 Miguel Herrera did not know what to do 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.180
 wrong the bolillo fits very well 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.190
 half time we thought maybe I would 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.260
 said chelís going to enter corona by alan 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.570
 and it will be a sung change does not decide 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.540
 esquivel esquivel does not go well things of 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.400
 football fits the ball very well with 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.140
 two lines of four and with the man more 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.490
 advance that is nurse plays very well 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.710
 panama individually and in what 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.710
 collective are going up to the front
