00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
I've yet to try it but I think it sounds

pretty<00:01:49.860> freakin<00:01:50.399> interesting<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.330> only

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pretty freakin interesting the only

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
pretty freakin interesting the only
downside<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.679> gun<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.069> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.489> put

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
downside about this gun is you can put

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.400 
downside about this gun is you can put
yourself<00:01:53.819> down<00:01:54.119> by<00:01:54.450> shooting<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.050> at<00:01:55.229> your

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
yourself down by shooting like at your

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.710 
yourself down by shooting like at your
feet<00:01:55.679> but<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.459> you<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:56.970> sham<00:01:57.300> shield<00:01:57.569> on

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
feet but if you do have a sham shield on

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960 
feet but if you do have a sham shield on
it's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.170> very<00:01:58.440> easy<00:01:58.679> way<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.250> regenerate

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.690 
it's a very easy way to just regenerate
ammo

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
as you'll see later on and it never

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.060 
as you'll see later on and it never
really<00:02:04.450> took<00:02:04.719> my<00:02:04.899> shield<00:02:05.170> down<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.710> really

a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.879> bit<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.239> will<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.629> that<00:02:13.870> but

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
a little bit so you will see that but

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.710 
a little bit so you will see that but
yeah<00:02:15.010> when<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.489> go<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:15.849> this<00:02:15.940> gun<00:02:16.150> try<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.540> get

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
yeah when you go for this gun try to get

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
yeah when you go for this gun try to get
the<00:02:16.840> casual<00:02:17.349> prefix<00:02:17.890> by<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.130> way<00:02:18.370> because

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the casual prefix by the way because

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.449 
the casual prefix by the way because
casual<00:02:19.120> prefix<00:02:19.569> will<00:02:20.019> give<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.410> x<00:02:20.739> 3<00:02:21.220> so

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
casual prefix will give it that x 3 so

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.580 
casual prefix will give it that x 3 so
you<00:02:21.519> will<00:02:21.760> shoot<00:02:21.940> free<00:02:22.300> Rockets<00:02:22.750> instead<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.349> 1

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
you will shoot free Rockets instead of 1

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.500 
you will shoot free Rockets instead of 1
so<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.069> seen<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.550> at<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.209> beginning

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
so if you seen there at the beginning

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.479 
so if you seen there at the beginning
that<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.810> was<00:02:25.989> shooting<00:02:26.170> 3<00:02:26.650> Rockets<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> set<00:02:27.400> of

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
that I was shooting 3 Rockets is set of

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.309 
that I was shooting 3 Rockets is set of
1<00:02:27.700> maybe<00:02:27.880> yours<00:02:28.120> only<00:02:28.239> shoots<00:02:28.540> 1<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.140> why

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
1 maybe yours only shoots 1 that is why

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.369 
1 maybe yours only shoots 1 that is why
the<00:02:29.890> casual<00:02:30.310> prefix<00:02:30.760> gives<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.209> x<00:02:31.690> 3<00:02:32.110> free

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
the casual prefix gives it that x 3 free

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.130 
the casual prefix gives it that x 3 free
fix<00:02:32.650> at<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.220> cost<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.819> 3<00:02:34.180> mo<00:02:34.450> per<00:02:34.630> shut<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.080> do

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
fix at the cost of 3 mo per shut I do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.949 
fix at the cost of 3 mo per shut I do
believe<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.920> I'd<00:02:36.700> say<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.390> casual<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
believe so I'd say go for the casual to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.420 
believe so I'd say go for the casual to
each<00:02:38.140> their<00:02:38.349> own<00:02:38.470> maybe<00:02:38.739> you're<00:02:38.980> craig<00:02:39.220> and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
not really sure what prefix that would

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.640
