00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 Who knows, what the hell is the talk? 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 touch I'm bringing you another video of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.619
 channel 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 I will, I made this video here more 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.289
 because I saw a lot of people asking 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
 I'll talk 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 I will show that my 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 drink 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.160
 I will also show you in the videos of my 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.300
 computer and baby flaps serve the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.870
 settings play leaves blood but 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 this shooting to show when 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.610
 hit shakes avatar display not only 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 what's that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 the ball sees the right-hander in the video 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.460
 resolution is that 24 or 768 are for the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.510
 gazette two bits 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 here is the scrotum pb bruno 50 already like me 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.640
 I think everything is marked 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.760
 Sound is the game I usually do not know anymore 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 when I can record 10 control 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.110
 a lot of people ask me that show 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:25.680
 here I change the weapon one is to change 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.640
 Quick swap gun is not not what the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.820
 mine to carry out a bomb and invest in 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 instead of what I have is just this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.590
 festivity 3575 a division 80 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.460
 nuno lost 10 with 35 in the games and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.460
 voting windows in the mouse means 800 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.869
 and bee the performance and left these two 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 marked options 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.509
 I think these others do not influence 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 nothing is made of ground now 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.820
 I ask why the gnr herds 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.180
 those marketing on the wall 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.799
 business 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.729
 I do not use it because it sometimes gets in the way. 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:10.200
 you were playing sometimes you confuse 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.180
 and for me it does not have much function 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.510
 this is not difficult 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.700
 I leave it's quality low use 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.799
 I only play with shadow on top the rest is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.109
 everything low that the character does thing 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:30.510
 foolish and leaving low on high low 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:33.209
 low unit and here my question 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.000
 its the worst makro mark so I 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.670
 had 18 and 23 share of 5 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 right here that I use and I'll show 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.409
 now you setup my pc here 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.760
 for those who ask about the settings 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:50.239
 from the computer 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.159

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.769
 ram memory processing 4 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.019
 the notes on my computer is a 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.909
 7.1 processor 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.519
 the delay is 7.2 of graphics 6.9 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.799
 games graphics 6.9 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.419
 Who wants to buy my failure in the 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.669
