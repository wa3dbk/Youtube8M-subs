play like gears three gears one was

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180 
play like gears three gears one was
really<00:01:26.690> fast<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.230> we<00:01:27.290> slowed<00:01:27.620> down<00:01:27.770> gears<00:01:28.040> to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
really fast and we slowed down gears to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.920 
really fast and we slowed down gears to
a<00:01:28.220> little<00:01:28.490> bit<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.790> terms<00:01:29.180> of<00:01:29.330> trying<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.630> again

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
a little bit in terms of trying to again

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.290 
a little bit in terms of trying to again
to<00:01:30.470> make<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.740> more<00:01:30.920> accessible<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:31.550> we<00:01:32.120> felt

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
to make it more accessible and we felt

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.850 
to make it more accessible and we felt
like<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.840> know<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.229> think<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.620> lot<00:01:33.800> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
like it you know I think a lot of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.080 
like it you know I think a lot of
feedback<00:01:34.190> we've<00:01:34.340> gotten<00:01:34.490> from<00:01:34.610> players<00:01:34.880> is

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
feedback we've gotten from players is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.670 
feedback we've gotten from players is
that<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:35.300> felt<00:01:35.510> like<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.690> pendulum<00:01:36.260> swung<00:01:36.470> too

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
that we felt like the pendulum swung too

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.950 
that we felt like the pendulum swung too
far<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:37.640> we've<00:01:38.090> found<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.630> middle

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
far and so we've found this middle

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:58.200 
far and so we've found this middle
ground<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:41.350> think<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.590> found<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.860> sweet<00:01:42.950> spot

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
put a gear spin on it so it's actually a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.150 
put a gear spin on it so it's actually a
