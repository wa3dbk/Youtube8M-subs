00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
temperature temperature gage just

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
temperature temperature gage just
hanging<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:23.570> 40<00:01:24.570> 46<00:01:25.290> degrees<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:26.189> nose

have much Sun let's go outside and see
see<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.410> difference<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.250> temperature<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
see the difference in temperature so you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.270 
see the difference in temperature so you
can<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.760> it's<00:01:49.910> gonna<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:50.830> that's<00:01:51.830> what<00:01:52.040> we<00:01:52.160> had

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
can see it's gonna be that's what we had

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.690 
can see it's gonna be that's what we had
47<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:53.060> there<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.890> gonna<00:01:55.010> start<00:01:55.280> climbing

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
47 in there it's gonna start climbing

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:28.640 
47 in there it's gonna start climbing
down<00:01:56.000> drastically<00:01:56.510> pretty<00:01:57.170> soon

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.410 

most<00:02:29.650> people<00:02:29.860> must<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.189> just<00:02:30.400> 40<00:02:30.700> degrees<00:02:30.970> out

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
most people must be just 40 degrees out

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.610 
most people must be just 40 degrees out
I<00:02:31.650> still<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.829> seven<00:02:33.579> degree<00:02:33.849> raise<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.360> not

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
I still think seven degree raise is not

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.069 
I still think seven degree raise is not
not<00:02:35.620> too<00:02:35.799> bad<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.280> early<00:02:36.579> in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.730> morning
