00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.670
 I don't like to apologize will be 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.040
 xvi pride I hide but I was hoping to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.090
 We never need it we rush 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.520
 of mood 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.440
 tears of joy always with bottom 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.869
 I hate love in this story 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.600
 is my nature back from a chair too 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.200
 like a plain that died only for those who have 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.780
 fear 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.180
 the only stop to have won when everything is 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.040
 finished like a cactus that dies one 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.580
 once it has bloomed and now that I am 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.009
 dying 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.810
 I know it is not enough to give the best flowers 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.660
 they wither to leave them at the mercy of 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.149
 wind think that my friend think of 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.149
 how you suffer the heart that impacts the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.220
 consciousness 109 and now that remains of the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.740
 past days together intended for 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.690
 melt in silence like snow 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.179
 the balance that becomes stable in 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.440
 little by little like when you sleep it seems to 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.440
 fall into the void 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.640
 I have two different people who do 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.190
 they say but they are like day and night 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.680
 that monkeys never meet for this 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.410
 I don't know with that narrow north without feathers 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.140
 home for me you are a lost cause or other 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.180
 two faces like the moon and a dark one 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.170
 I survive until this remains 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.000
 unknown too selfish to forgive me 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.730
 it is completely too complicated to tell you 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.260
 which will be forever because it is a scam 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 I don't keep promises 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.209
 and as thieves do, I run away with the lights 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.760
 turned off a time flows the same but renders 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.100
 different things and with amplified settings 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.959
 and ticking of the hands and carrying 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.110
 blood to my ears as for 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.670
 remember the wounds never healed 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.459
 really then that on the doorstep 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 I turn my back saline keep his eyes 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.290
 to hide tears 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.890
 all right 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.360
 the more I understand that it is over I can no longer 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.820
 to do without 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.010
 as if at the same time it was an antidote 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.200
 to poisons like the snow that beautiful from 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.270
 look only at Christmas night then the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.450
 step on without thinking about how much it does 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.450
 bad
