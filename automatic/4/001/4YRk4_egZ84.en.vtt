00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
actually you know how some people ring

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800 
actually you know how some people ring
in<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.340> asked<00:01:58.640> with<00:01:58.759> their<00:01:58.880> own<00:01:59.000> -<00:01:59.240> parsley

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
