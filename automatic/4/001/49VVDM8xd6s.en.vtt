00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
after the Gameboy the Gameboy pocket but
that<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.239> smaller<00:00:54.930> version<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> the

screen that you saw on all the other
Gameboy<00:01:02.969> systems<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> true

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
Gameboy systems but this was the true

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.730 
Gameboy systems but this was the true
successor<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> Game<00:01:06.000> Boy<00:01:06.030> line<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.560> Game

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
successor to the Game Boy line the Game

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
successor to the Game Boy line the Game
Boy<00:01:07.860> Color<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> featured<00:01:08.700> color<00:01:09.420> graphics<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
Boy Color it featured color graphics I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.460 
Boy Color it featured color graphics I
had<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.640> bit<00:01:11.760> powerful<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:13.080> powerful

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
had a little bit powerful more powerful

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
had a little bit powerful more powerful
processor<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.040> believe<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.540> have

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
processor I believe so it could have

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
processor I believe so it could have
better<00:01:15.990> graphics<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.040> main<00:01:17.310> attraction

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
better graphics but the main attraction

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
better graphics but the main attraction
was<00:01:18.119> definitely<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> color<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
was definitely the color and because of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.789 
was definitely the color and because of
this<00:01:20.189> obviously<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> gameboy<00:01:23.450> color<00:01:24.799> became

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
this obviously the gameboy color became

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.460 
this obviously the gameboy color became
extremely<00:01:26.369> popular<00:01:26.930> let's<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.080> take<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> look

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
extremely popular let's just take a look

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.640 
extremely popular let's just take a look
at<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> system<00:01:29.009> itself<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:31.140> always<00:01:31.290> do

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
at the system itself as we always do

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
at the system itself as we always do
here's<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> screen<00:01:33.329> very<00:01:34.320> nice<00:01:34.619> screen<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
here's the screen very nice screen it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
here's the screen very nice screen it's
it<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.689> good<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> put<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it looks very good when you put up to a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.510 
it looks very good when you put up to a
light<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.740> no<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:41.040> no<00:01:41.220> backlight

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
light like that no you know no backlight

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
light like that no you know no backlight
but<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:43.020> still<00:01:43.350> worked<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.130> well<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
but it still worked very well the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
but it still worked very well the
reflective<00:01:45.030> screen<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.420> very<00:01:45.630> nice<00:01:45.840> here's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
reflective screen was very nice here's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.210 
reflective screen was very nice here's
just<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> power<00:01:47.700> light<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.390> believe<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.740> gets

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
just the power light I believe that gets

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.690 
just the power light I believe that gets
dimmer<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.630> lose<00:01:52.350> battery<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.549> just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
dimmer as you lose battery it was just

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.990 
dimmer as you lose battery it was just
the<00:01:53.790> gameboy<00:01:54.119> color<00:01:54.329> logo<00:01:55.250> all<00:01:56.250> those<00:01:56.549> colors

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the gameboy color logo all those colors

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.219 
the gameboy color logo all those colors
that<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.420> showed<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.079> believe

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that it showed right there I believe

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
that it showed right there I believe
were<00:01:58.560> original<00:01:59.189> Game<00:01:59.579> Boy<00:01:59.610> Color<00:01:59.969> color

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
colors they had more colors in the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
colors they had more colors in the
future<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.780> tons<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.560> different<00:02:04.649> colors

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
