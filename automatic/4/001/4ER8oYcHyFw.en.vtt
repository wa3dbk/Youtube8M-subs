 this is one of the ways you can check 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.819
 if your cell phone 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.310
 it is a copy of the original or called 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.310
 Pirate is personal so be very careful in 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.600
 time and if any person you want 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.170
 sell for example a general motorcycle and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.410
 s5 a despiria 16 a 11 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.239
 nexus runs this program before 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.580
 better kiss gives a little glance that can 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.790
 be the program checks in the snow there if 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.850
 to appear world means that it is a 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.160
 authentic sound authentic but also 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.300
 It's not for us to put too much 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.760
 confidence in this is personal checks 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.739
 also if you had this battery check 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.019
 if you have there email numbers all 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.780
 right have serial number understood 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.670
 to see if it's a more legitimate business 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.390
 even more ask if you have the invoice 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.980
 original device also right then 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.329
 this avoids many headaches that 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.850
 Are you buying a hearing aid? 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.120
 suddenly a pirate wall they have 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.400
 for a price there is from the original this is not 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.250
 interesting is not cool because it's not 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.010
 is often with the seal of the anatel 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.640
 also has your anatel 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.660
 is what makes the device homologation 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.220
 Some people then I hope that 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.570
