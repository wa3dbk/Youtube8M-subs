 between 2 a 400 gpu mali and a battery

 of 1,700 milliamps 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.380
 I've been using it for several days. This is my 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 main equipment and I installed it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 everyday applications such as facebook 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.460
 twitter instagram spotify among others the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.960
 it really executes the applications very well 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.659
 there is no problem in multitasking and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 load times are very short the layer 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.020
 of android of this equipment is proprietary 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 in fort he does not have many 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 modifications but this is appreciated already 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.250
 that does not limit the performance of the equipment 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 Y 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.909
 yes 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.790
 battery life is good using it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.590
 with social networks called listening 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.420
 music gives me the full day with 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.120
 approximately 4 hours of screen 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.150
 lit 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.030
 The screen is 4.5 inches ips with 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.770
 technology or gs wang the solution which 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.480
 Allows the display to be thinner 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.600
 resistant and improves the quality as well 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.370
 the viewing angles 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.320
 in the packaging including protective mica 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.560
 screen is resistant to 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.120
 scratches the alon feels very good is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 light gives a good feeling 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 construction the only disadvantage is that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.820
 It has a shiny finish which is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 it gets dirty and scratches easily so 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.510
 You will have to use some cover that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.879
 includes the equipment 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.680
 the front camera is 2 megapixels and 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.930
 the main one of 8 with flash autofocus 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.239
 and video in full hd the interface is 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.459
 full of options like hdr panorama made 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.319
 white balance as well as a mode 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.049
 ideal for self-portraits which retouch 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.549
 the face in real time if seeing in the 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.220
 best of its range the results go to 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.720
 be good in most situations 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.720
 ideal for sharing social networks 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.150
 has an open television but you should 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.100
 connect hearing aids to work 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.900
 as an antenna you can decide whether to listen 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.970
 on the speaker or the headphones as well as 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.020
 record some speaker program to a 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.020
 strong and with good sharpness 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.760
 there is nothing to congratulate in fort the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.230
 the effort they make in creating these 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480
 smartphones of good quality and good 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.189
 price has some aspects that can be improved 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.349
 but in general it's a good team and what 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.560
 I highly recommend it and this was the
