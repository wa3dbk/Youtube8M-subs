velour<00:01:17.130> lashes<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.180> tray<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.930> come

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
velour lashes is the tray that they come

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.170 
velour lashes is the tray that they come
in<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:20.100> might<00:01:20.280> seem<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.549> nothing<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
in and this might seem like nothing to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
in and this might seem like nothing to
some<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.110> wear<00:01:22.320> eyelashes<00:01:23.189> all

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
some of you but you wear eyelashes all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
some of you but you wear eyelashes all
the<00:01:23.640> time<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the time like I do this is kind of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
the time like I do this is kind of
essential<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.850> tray<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.360> come<00:01:27.540> on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
essential so the tray that they come on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
essential so the tray that they come on
is<00:01:27.960> rather<00:01:28.200> curved<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.340> really

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
is rather curved so if you have really

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.039 
is rather curved so if you have really
round<00:01:29.880> eyes<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.840> work

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
round eyes these are gonna work

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
round eyes these are gonna work
perfectly<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> even<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> don't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
perfectly for you and even if you don't

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450 
perfectly for you and even if you don't
I<00:01:33.000> find<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.780> curved<00:01:34.110> lash<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:35.009> better<00:01:35.220> than

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
I find a curved lash is much better than

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
I find a curved lash is much better than
one<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.210> straight<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
one that is more straight because it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
one that is more straight because it's
gonna<00:01:37.619> last<00:01:37.979> longer<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.640> eye<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.329> be

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
gonna last longer on your eye and be

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
gonna last longer on your eye and be
easier<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.140> apply<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
easier to apply so right now I'm just

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
easier to apply so right now I'm just
showing<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.689> them<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
it's time to apply them to your eyes and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.550 
it's time to apply them to your eyes and
I<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.850> using<00:02:39.000> duo<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.900> surgical<00:02:40.440> grade

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I like using duo it's a surgical grade

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.010 
I like using duo it's a surgical grade
adhesive<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> only<00:02:42.330> thing<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.720> trust

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
adhesive and it's the only thing I trust

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
sensitivity you won't be able to use duo

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.490

a very thin strip of glue and just wait

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.530 
a very thin strip of glue and just wait
about<00:03:49.470> 30<00:03:49.860> seconds<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.700> glue<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.180> become

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
about 30 seconds for the glue to become

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.530 
about 30 seconds for the glue to become
tacky<00:03:51.960> it<00:03:52.470> will<00:03:52.710> darken<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.430> color<00:03:53.460> so<00:03:54.330> that's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
tacky it will darken in color so that's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.360 
tacky it will darken in color so that's
when<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.230> dark<00:03:55.470> tone<00:03:55.710> is<00:03:55.950> good<00:03:56.190> to

with the middle and it just goes on

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.850 
with the middle and it just goes on
really<00:04:06.030> nicely<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.630> can<00:04:06.780> use<00:04:07.050> tweezers<00:04:07.320> for

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
really nicely you can use tweezers for

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.190

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
with my own fingers works best then I go

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.849 
with my own fingers works best then I go
to<00:04:17.670> the<00:04:17.910> outer<00:04:18.090> corner<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.410> stick<00:04:19.680> on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the inner corner and it should be as

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
the inner corner and it should be as
easy<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.350> if<00:04:22.740> you've<00:04:22.920> waited<00:04:23.190> long

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.040 
black as I would like it so I do go back
and<00:05:24.129> clean<00:05:24.430> up<00:05:24.460> any<00:05:24.759> mistakes<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.840> glue

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
and clean up any mistakes that the glue

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:39.270 
and clean up any mistakes that the glue
left<00:05:26.349> behind

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.680 

that's<00:05:40.280> how<00:05:40.520> easy<00:05:40.550> application<00:05:41.450> should<00:05:41.630> be

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
that's how easy application should be

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.420 
that's how easy application should be
just<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.110> steady<00:05:42.380> hand<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.890> waiting<00:05:43.250> long

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
just a steady hand and waiting long

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.040 
just a steady hand and waiting long
enough<00:05:43.460> for<00:05:43.820> that<00:05:43.970> glue<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.240> become<00:05:44.510> tacky<00:05:44.780> as

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
enough for that glue to become tacky as

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.440 
enough for that glue to become tacky as
all<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:45.470> need<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.830> do<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:46.340> this<00:05:46.880> is<00:05:46.940> what<00:05:47.240> the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
all you need to do and this is what the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.510 
all you need to do and this is what the
finished<00:05:47.870> makeup<00:05:48.050> looks<00:05:48.470> like<00:05:48.650> with<00:05:48.980> lashes

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
finished makeup looks like with lashes

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.640 
finished makeup looks like with lashes
it<00:05:49.820> just<00:05:50.060> adds<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.780> right<00:05:50.990> amount<00:05:51.290> of<00:05:51.380> drama

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
it just adds the right amount of drama

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.440 
it just adds the right amount of drama
while<00:05:52.040> still<00:05:52.340> looking<00:05:52.520> natural<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.330> just

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
while still looking natural and just

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.750 
while still looking natural and just
really<00:05:53.780> completes<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.350> look<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:55.370> now<00:05:55.520> onto
