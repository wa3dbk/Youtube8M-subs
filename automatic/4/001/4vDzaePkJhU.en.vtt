00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello to all today i 'm going to you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 learn how to use the theorem 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.370
 of pythagoras so first of all what he 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 must know about the Pythagorean theorem 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.039
 is that the square of this side of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 the hypothenuse caress him for example the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.220
 caress alone on that side this is this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 7 times and turns so has 8 x 8 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.550
 so the square of the hypotenuse is equal 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 to the sum of the squares of the other two 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 sides so basically the point 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 interrogation is equal that's all because 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 and +8 squared so we go first 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.559
 started by writing equality so that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 I just told you the square of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.699
 the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:58.050
 two looks and so cb squared is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.910
 equal to so bo because is so it's 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.909
 all because is there then we put to b squared 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.909
 more enough so 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.750
 it's squared so once we have that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.990
 we at the base after just enough to 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.920
 put the wavelengths 8 and 7 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.810
 so we'll start with 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.410
 so that's good we do not know it 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 leave like this cb squared and 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:39.680
 galas ab squared so abc7 so we put 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:46.220
 this square enough to the square so 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.720
 8 squared it's very simple 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.200
 now just do the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.950
 calculations 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.950
 so we continue we give cb to the cays 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:06.820
 equal so this water because and it is this 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:06.820
 times 7 so 49 +8 squared that's 64 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.390
 now that we have it, we're going 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:22.130
 have to put the sum of 2 so 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:24.910
 is still recovering cb therefore equal 49 64 it 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.910
 does 121 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:33.340
 and our theorem is practically over 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.200
 you just have to take the water 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.219
 results we had with the sum of 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.680
 squares of the other two sides and so of 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.280
 do its square root so the root 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.349
 square 221 its eleven because 11 x 11 is equal 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.189
 at 121 so we can put that cb and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:03:03.909
 this time we're not a quarter and 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:03:08.609
 equal 11 and can be put because his 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.609
 father is equal to 11 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.290
 this is our theorem is over he does not 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.620
 is more than enough to put the sentence 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:28.989
 answer so the side cb measure on cm 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 so here we can put it now and 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.220
 you see that it's really not 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.080
 Wizard 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.849
 here I hope you have been and that 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.280
 you understood the author of pythagoras 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.280
 and I tell you love next hi
