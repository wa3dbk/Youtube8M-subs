said for the QuickTime events I had some

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
said for the QuickTime events I had some
problems<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.119> reading<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> my

problems with it reading some of my
motions<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> huge<00:02:11.069> problem<00:02:11.310> when<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
motions this was a huge problem when I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.760 
motions this was a huge problem when I
was<00:02:11.670> trying<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> avoid<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.450> these<00:02:12.780> spiders<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
was trying to avoid all these spiders I

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
was trying to avoid all these spiders I
died<00:02:13.920> over<00:02:14.370> 20<00:02:14.400> times<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.660> while<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.320> nice

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
died over 20 times and while it was nice

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.020 
died over 20 times and while it was nice
that<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.800> put<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> save<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.610> next<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that they put the save right next to the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.750 
that they put the save right next to the
event<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.690> took<00:02:18.750> way<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.410> long<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.280> reload<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
event it took way too long to reload the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
event it took way too long to reload the
save<00:02:20.970> file<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.810> extremely<00:02:22.500> frustrating

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
save file it was extremely frustrating

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.790 
save file it was extremely frustrating
to<00:02:23.730> die<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.570> wait<00:02:24.780> 30<00:02:25.110> seconds<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
to die and then wait 30 seconds for it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.860 
to die and then wait 30 seconds for it
to<00:02:25.890> reload<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.970> was<00:02:27.120> even<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.600> annoying

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to reload and it was even more annoying

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
to reload and it was even more annoying
that<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> wasn't<00:02:28.590> even<00:02:28.650> my<00:02:28.920> fault<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.700> just

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that it wasn't even my fault it just

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.700 
that it wasn't even my fault it just
would<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.210> read<00:02:30.660> one<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> certain<00:02:31.380> motion

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
would not read one of the certain motion

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.620 
would not read one of the certain motion
controls<00:02:32.070> correctly<00:02:32.640> since<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.150> changes<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
controls correctly since it changes the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.090 
controls correctly since it changes the
button<00:02:33.960> or<00:02:34.080> motion<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.620> had<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:34.890> each

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
button or motion that you had to do each

button or motion that you had to do each
time<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.460> do<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> QuickTime<00:02:36.000> event<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.570> did

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
time you do the QuickTime event I did

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
time you do the QuickTime event I did
finally<00:02:37.140> beat<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.590> QuickTime<00:02:37.980> event<00:02:38.280> when<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
finally beat this QuickTime event when I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.180 
finally beat this QuickTime event when I
got<00:02:38.700> lucky<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.090> almost<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.750> pushed<00:02:40.110> Z's<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
got lucky with almost all pushed Z's the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.620 
got lucky with almost all pushed Z's the
spider<00:02:41.460> specialty<00:02:42.030> moves<00:02:42.210> were<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
spider specialty moves were that it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.690 
spider specialty moves were that it
could<00:02:42.780> walk<00:02:42.960> up<00:02:43.170> walls<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.860> shoot<00:02:44.370> out<00:02:44.490> webs

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
could walk up walls and shoot out webs

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.130 
could walk up walls and shoot out webs
that<00:02:44.850> could<00:02:45.030> access<00:02:45.390> areas<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.840> were<00:02:45.960> too

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that could access areas that were too

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.840 
that could access areas that were too
hard<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> normally<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.610> might<00:02:47.820> just

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
hard to get to normally or might just

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.580 
hard to get to normally or might just
use<00:02:48.180> its<00:02:48.330> web<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.720> slow<00:02:48.930> down<00:02:49.110> an<00:02:49.260> oncoming

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590

enemy the Scorpion on the other hand was

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.870 
enemy the Scorpion on the other hand was
a<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.870> slower<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.560> more<00:02:52.770> powerful<00:02:53.340> he<00:02:53.760> could

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
a bit slower but more powerful he could

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
a bit slower but more powerful he could
also<00:02:54.060> dig<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.540> certain<00:02:54.810> areas<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.260> he<00:02:55.380> could

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
also dig in certain areas so he could

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.870 
also dig in certain areas so he could
find<00:02:55.680> different<00:02:56.100> ways<00:02:56.130> around<00:02:56.400> blocked

enough<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.660> health<00:03:00.870> he<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.320> do<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> quite

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
enough in health he could do a quite

that's what would normally happen when a
spider<00:03:07.410> or<00:03:07.590> scorpion<00:03:08.310> kill<00:03:08.550> something<00:03:09.030> well

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
spider or scorpion kill something well

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.090 
spider or scorpion kill something well
it<00:03:09.840> may<00:03:09.960> look<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.440> worlds<00:03:10.680> are<00:03:10.770> open<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
it may look like the worlds are open to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.190 
it may look like the worlds are open to
explore<00:03:11.520> it's<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.270> there<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:12.930> things<00:03:12.990> that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
explore it's not there are things that

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.080 
explore it's not there are things that
will<00:03:13.350> constantly<00:03:13.800> block<00:03:14.160> your<00:03:14.370> path<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.030> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
will constantly block your path so you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550 
will constantly block your path so you
will<00:03:15.270> find<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> game<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.990> more<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.290> Rails

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
will find that the game is more on Rails

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.380 
will find that the game is more on Rails
than<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.920> would<00:03:17.040> expect<00:03:17.490> at<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.150> end<00:03:18.300> of

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
than you would expect at the end of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.330 
than you would expect at the end of
every<00:03:18.600> level<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.990> boss<00:03:19.260> fight<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:20.130> could<00:03:20.250> be

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
every level is a boss fight it could be

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.250 
every level is a boss fight it could be
anything<00:03:20.550> from<00:03:20.670> gila<00:03:21.090> monsters<00:03:21.660> snakes<00:03:22.050> or

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
anything from gila monsters snakes or

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.810 
anything from gila monsters snakes or
even<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.770> other<00:03:22.890> character<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.640> you're

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
even the other character that you're

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.550 
even the other character that you're
controlling<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.570> was<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> bit<00:03:25.020> cool<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
controlling it was a bit cool that the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.750 
controlling it was a bit cool that the
two<00:03:25.680> characters<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.250> you're<00:03:26.370> controlling

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
two characters that you're controlling

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.640 
two characters that you're controlling
fight<00:03:27.270> each<00:03:27.420> other<00:03:27.630> once<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.080> while<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
fight each other once in a while the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.110 
fight each other once in a while the
camera<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.130> game<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.520> problem<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.090> it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
camera in the game was a problem as it

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.610 
camera in the game was a problem as it
would<00:03:30.360> often<00:03:30.720> get<00:03:30.840> stuck<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.260> weird<00:03:31.500> positions

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
would often get stuck in weird positions

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
would often get stuck in weird positions
you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.459> easily<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.910> switch<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.120> back<00:03:33.420> but

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
you can easily just switch it back but

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.180 
you can easily just switch it back but
it<00:03:33.959> would<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.200> problematic<00:03:34.890> when<00:03:35.040> you're

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
it would get problematic when you're

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.620 
it would get problematic when you're
fighting<00:03:35.520> other<00:03:35.640> animals<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.450> don't

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
fighting other animals and you don't

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.600 
fighting other animals and you don't
have<00:03:36.780> time<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.170> do<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.950> game<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.370> quite

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
have time to do that the game is quite

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.280 
have time to do that the game is quite
short<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.120> beat<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.480> game<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.780> less<00:03:39.930> than<00:03:40.080> four

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
short I beat the game in less than four

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.199 
short I beat the game in less than four
hours<00:03:40.320> but<00:03:41.070> if<00:03:41.190> you're<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> completist<00:03:41.970> there

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
hours but if you're a completist there

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.210 
hours but if you're a completist there
were<00:03:42.300> over<00:03:42.600> 400<00:03:42.840> grubs<00:03:43.350> defined<00:03:43.770> in<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.010> 10

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
were over 400 grubs defined in the 10

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.980 
were over 400 grubs defined in the 10
levels<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> game<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.420> at<00:03:45.540> least<00:03:45.720> there's<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
levels of the game so at least there's a

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.330 
levels of the game so at least there's a
little<00:03:46.320> bit<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.530> replayability

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
little bit of replayability

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.340 
little bit of replayability
there<00:03:47.790> was<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.150> gallery<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.630> concept<00:03:49.170> art

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
there was also a gallery of concept art

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990 
there was also a gallery of concept art

Thornton and Dennis Hopper that you can

Thornton and Dennis Hopper that you can
unlock<00:03:52.860> my<00:03:53.370> problem<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> game<00:03:54.030> was<00:03:54.240> that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
unlock my problem of the game was that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.850 
unlock my problem of the game was that
it<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.720> wasn't<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.140> compelling<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.620> play

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
it really wasn't that compelling to play

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.770 
it really wasn't that compelling to play
in<00:03:56.190> fact<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.730> could<00:03:56.850> be<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.180> boring<00:03:57.480> at

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
in fact it could be a bit boring at

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780 
in fact it could be a bit boring at
times<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.500> with<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.740> said<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.190> game<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.400> one

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
times but with that said the game is one

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.370 
times but with that said the game is one
you<00:03:59.910> should<00:04:00.090> play<00:04:00.270> if<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.050> unique

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
you should play if not for the unique

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.410 
you should play if not for the unique
nature<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> game<00:04:02.130> itself<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.000> do<00:04:03.060> think

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
nature of the game itself and I do think

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.980 
nature of the game itself and I do think
deadly<00:04:03.810> creatures<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.350> worth<00:04:04.560> Arendt
