00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 m 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:10.420
 hello guys welcome then in the video 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.350
 today I talk about this here and there 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.129
 sound 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.349
 lgl ap 340 what I essentially do 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.830
 hard to keep it in hand we try it 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.390
 essentially a sound system 4.1 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.249
 then four more channels on two channels 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.039
 front two side channels for 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.680
 the sovereign effect that two subwoofers have 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.080
 I show below are two cones from 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.590
 10 cm one bass reflex assignment 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.030
 but so aside there is the joke it 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 in the part at the other point for the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.290
 load is a system that is used for 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.660
 place under the TV that 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.050
 must be positioned above panel is 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.690
 nice solid where you can not get 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.630
 you are not afraid you will not have to be afraid 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:05.170
 what kind of TV because it holds 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:07.119
 almost 40 kg and is a capable system 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.030
 precisely to improve with extreme 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.249
 simplicity the quality of television 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.020
 which as we know does enough 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:17.649
 I say it sucks enough on the two 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.159
 themes very simple because why for 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:24.069
 connect the cable two cables will suffice 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.560
 power supply but so is the cable 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.520
 optical that is already included in the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.939
 package 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.090
 here then there is a small selector that is 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.399
 built with practically power cars 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.990
 once put in once 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.999
 connected to the TV when the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.909
 go down TV will also turn on 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:45.939
 this sun plate automatically 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.319
 if instead you want to control it without the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.469
 in short, a trend without 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.770
 automatic mode as they are there 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.929
 other four keys power key 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.179
 blue check button me the button 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.810
 function to select the mode of 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.700
 operation 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.799
 why be a case of the kind that it is 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.069
 this product is also equipped with 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.560
 wireless bluetooth technology what 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.170
 the first series serves two things 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.870
 television 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.790
 lg produced from 2013 onwards through 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.300
 a technology called samsung 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.500
 allows you to talk directly 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.140
 TV set without cable 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 optical then switch on configured trams 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 electric of the sound the enters immediately 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.630
 without TV on this will be a plateau 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.220
 you can then use it as you will use 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.040
 any other bluetooth device 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 that is, you have a phone, you have a polish 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.959
 a tablet you can pay in ling with 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 the sound plate and transfer directly 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.190
 the sound of music when you use it 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380
 the TV set used for 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.090
 amplify improving air quality 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
 of the TV when they were using 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.610
 you can use a small system 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:58.580
 stereo helps in the packaging there is also 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.190
 this very minimal remote control with 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.330
 simply the power button in 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.900
 cinema sound button this product at 2 e 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 what predefined actions 1 cinema that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.150
 enhances bass performance finanziamente 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.609
 hence and for those who sound a little more 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.070
 full bodied the other when disabled is 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.109
 a flatter collection you need for 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.170
 make the voice feel good basically 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.780
 the volume key up and down mute key 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.430
 then the bluetooth optical and lg tv button 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.350
 precisely to select the mode 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.890
 tested for quality 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.130
 audio 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 we say that the steps are convincing 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.250
 Improved average high mica weather is good 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.720
 but also a bit of sharpness in the highs 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.820
 don't think you have a real sound 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.549
 surround because it also depends a lot on where 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.459
 put it in place let's say it's good for 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.920
 his duty but if you are looking for a system 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.840
 surround let's say let's lose 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.569
 it's better than no it obviously gets better than 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.180
 very much the audio quality level of the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.370
 your TV on that I put the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.019
 hand on fire 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.100
 so a pretty product 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.620
 convincing for me 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.630
 written because there is a small footprint of 70 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.600
 centimeters 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.560
 there are 70 cm wide black are 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:24.940
 pardoned somewhere the excuse 32 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:28.350
 cm deep and only 3.5 cm 35 mm of 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.670
 height then on the TV without 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.910
 I got up too much and maybe messed up 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.460
 the viewing angle 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.940
 as said convincing plastic product 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.100
 Launched beautiful hard it is very easy to use 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.390
 that of the thing that a point in favor 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.200
 of this point that really simple 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.780
 simple simple to use price is not 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.550
 own economy at most are 300 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.090
 320 euros for this product 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.310
 but if we think of a system of 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.920
 speakers the reduced footprint that gives 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.290
 this is the ease of use more or less those 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.610
 prices we are there having a solution more 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.190
 elegant 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.530
 I would say that for this the 3 40 of allegis 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.570
 I'll see you in a priest 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.470
 next video commented as usual 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.000
 down here 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.000
