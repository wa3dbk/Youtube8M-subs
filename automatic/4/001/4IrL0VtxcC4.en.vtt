these and so there's four there's one

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.950 
these and so there's four there's one
that<00:01:36.650> would<00:01:37.040> be<00:01:37.160> down<00:01:37.340> here<00:01:37.720> one<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.840> would

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
that would be down here one that would

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.850 
that would be down here one that would
be<00:01:39.080> over<00:01:39.200> here<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.190> side<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.740> air

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
be over here on the side of the the air

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.060 
be over here on the side of the the air
filter<00:01:43.130> box<00:01:43.310> up<00:01:43.910> here<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.900> up<00:01:45.320> here<00:01:45.350> these

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
filter box up here and up here these

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.890 
filter box up here and up here these
down<00:01:46.310> here<00:01:46.340> especially<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.450> one's<00:01:47.659> kind<00:01:47.870> of

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
down here especially this one's kind of

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.530 
down here especially this one's kind of
it's<00:01:48.830> not<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.159> difficult<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.640> get<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.820> use

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
it's not really difficult to get to use

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.960 
it's not really difficult to get to use
an<00:01:50.659> extension<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:52.040> be<00:01:52.159> careful<00:01:52.520> when

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
an extension but just be careful when

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.399 
an extension but just be careful when
you<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.390> screw<00:01:53.960> out<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.290> there

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
you get that a screw out of there

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.300 
you get that a screw out of there
because<00:01:54.590> I've<00:01:55.100> dropped<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.640> few<00:01:55.880> times<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
because I've dropped it a few times and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.800 
because I've dropped it a few times and
most<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> time<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.760> lands<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.120> ground<00:01:59.210> but

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
that eyesore still hooked up I forgot to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.979 
that eyesore still hooked up I forgot to
mention<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:21.000> we're<00:04:21.180> still<00:04:21.390> hooked<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.720> here

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
mention this we're still hooked up here

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.580 
mention this we're still hooked up here
this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.010> radiator<00:04:23.670> tube<00:04:24.440> upper<00:04:25.440> radiator

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
this is the radiator tube upper radiator

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.940 
this is the radiator tube upper radiator
hose<00:04:25.890> right<00:04:26.250> there<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.240> we're<00:04:27.360> still<00:04:27.540> kind<00:04:27.570> of

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
hose right there so we're still kind of

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.950 
hose right there so we're still kind of
attached<00:04:28.950> right<00:04:29.250> there<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.200> just<00:04:31.380> kind<00:04:31.590> of

grab it and pull it up like that so
there<00:04:43.980> we<00:04:44.070> go<00:04:46.970> then<00:04:47.970> up<00:04:48.180> now<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.170> got<00:04:49.440> our<00:04:49.980> whole

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
there we go then up now we got our whole

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.540 
there we go then up now we got our whole
intake<00:04:51.540> tube<00:04:51.810> assembly<00:04:53.810> removed<00:04:55.220> that's<00:04:56.220> it

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
intake tube assembly removed that's it

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.750 
intake tube assembly removed that's it
so<00:04:56.730> now<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:58.020> can<00:04:58.200> see<00:04:58.320> they're<00:04:58.640> ready<00:04:59.640> to

this factory air intake tube it's kind
of<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> mess<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.600> thing<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:07.560> would<00:05:08.310> assume<00:05:08.640> some

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
of a mess of a thing I would assume some

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.240 
of a mess of a thing I would assume some
of<00:05:09.000> this<00:05:09.180> stuff<00:05:09.510> like<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.650> little<00:05:10.920> canister

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
of this stuff like this little canister

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.810 
of this stuff like this little canister
here<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.390> is<00:05:13.140> for<00:05:13.500> sound<00:05:14.220> deadening<00:05:14.520> or

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
here and this is for sound deadening or

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.450 
here and this is for sound deadening or
something<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:16.070> this<00:05:17.070> end<00:05:17.310> right

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
something like that but this end right

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.360 
something like that but this end right
here<00:05:17.790> comes<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.390> from<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.570> air<00:05:18.750> filter<00:05:19.370> this

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
here comes in from the air filter this

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.810 
here comes in from the air filter this
end<00:05:20.580> goes<00:05:20.760> into<00:05:20.910> your<00:05:21.030> throttle<00:05:21.390> body<00:05:21.570> so<00:05:22.820> yeah

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
end goes into your throttle body so yeah

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.000 
end goes into your throttle body so yeah
I'm<00:05:23.940> not<00:05:24.000> real<00:05:24.270> sure<00:05:24.450> what<00:05:24.660> all<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:24.930> junk<00:05:25.860> is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
I'm not real sure what all this junk is

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.280 
I'm not real sure what all this junk is
for<00:05:26.280> but<00:05:27.060> I'm<00:05:27.510> thinking<00:05:27.780> I'm<00:05:27.840> gonna<00:05:27.930> get<00:05:28.110> some

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
for but I'm thinking I'm gonna get some

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.650 
for but I'm thinking I'm gonna get some
like<00:05:29.220> some<00:05:29.400> 4-inch<00:05:29.760> exhaust<00:05:30.120> tubing<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.540> I'll

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
like some 4-inch exhaust tubing and I'll

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.560 
like some 4-inch exhaust tubing and I'll
fabricate<00:05:31.200> my<00:05:31.440> own<00:05:31.980> little<00:05:32.160> intake<00:05:33.000> tube<00:05:33.240> here

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
fabricate my own little intake tube here

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.470 
fabricate my own little intake tube here
save<00:05:34.470> me<00:05:34.590> some<00:05:34.770> money<00:05:35.060> instead<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.210> having<00:05:36.390> to

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
save me some money instead of having to

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.090 
save me some money instead of having to
buy<00:05:36.660> one<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:37.080> yeah<00:05:37.200> this<00:05:37.410> is<00:05:37.560> kind<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.890> big

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
buy one but yeah this is kind of a big

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.490 
buy one but yeah this is kind of a big
mess<00:05:38.940> of<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.210> thing<00:05:39.420> and<00:05:39.600> I<00:05:39.840> think<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.260> next

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
mess of a thing and I think the next

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.810 
mess of a thing and I think the next
thing<00:05:40.530> on<00:05:40.740> my<00:05:40.890> list<00:05:41.300> my<00:05:42.300> list<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.720> do<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.200> to

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
thing on my list my list to do is to

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.850 
thing on my list my list to do is to
fabricate<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.850> new<00:05:45.320> intake<00:05:46.320> assembly<00:05:46.560> so

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
fabricate a new intake assembly so

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.890 
fabricate a new intake assembly so
anyway<00:05:47.190> that's<00:05:48.060> what<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.390> thing<00:05:48.540> looks<00:05:48.750> like

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
anyway that's what this thing looks like

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.680 
anyway that's what this thing looks like
when<00:05:49.080> you<00:05:49.140> get<00:05:49.229> it<00:05:49.350> all<00:05:49.440> out
