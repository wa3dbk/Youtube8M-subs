and violence involved yeah this is the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
and violence involved yeah this is the
Dead<00:00:26.580> or<00:00:26.670> Alive<00:00:26.699> 5<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.300> came<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.599> last<00:00:27.750> year

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.580 
Dead or Alive 5 that came out last year
and<00:00:28.760> I<00:00:29.760> guess<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> main<00:00:30.960> difference<00:00:31.380> from

and I guess the main difference from

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.000 
and I guess the main difference from
Dead<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:31.980> Alive<00:00:32.040> 5<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.759> 5<00:00:33.329> ultimate<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.829> be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
Dead or Alive 5 and 5 ultimate would be

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130
