character their relationship so it's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.999 
character their relationship so it's
very<00:01:29.610> obvious<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.360> they're<00:01:31.320> acting<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
very obvious that they're acting like a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.170 
very obvious that they're acting like a
new<00:01:32.220> type<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> couple<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.000> never
