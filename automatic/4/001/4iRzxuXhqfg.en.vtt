as<00:00:00.060> online<00:00:00.599> entrepreneurs<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.920> really<00:00:02.220> have

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
as online entrepreneurs we really have

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.200 
as online entrepreneurs we really have
two<00:00:03.120> modes<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.170> being<00:00:04.859> ok<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:05.879> need<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.029> be

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
two modes of being ok we need to be

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.570 
two modes of being ok we need to be
aware<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.690> what<00:00:06.870> these<00:00:07.049> two<00:00:07.259> modes<00:00:07.529> are<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.069> we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
aware of what these two modes are and we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.020 
aware of what these two modes are and we
need<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> sort<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.360> turn<00:00:09.780> pro<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.500> catering<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
need to sort of turn pro at catering to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.180 
need to sort of turn pro at catering to
them<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.469> leverage<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
them so that we can leverage the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.210 
them so that we can leverage the
strengths<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.940> both<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:16.139> them<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.890> two

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
strengths of both of them these two

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130 
strengths of both of them these two
modes<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> few

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
modes you can think about these in a few

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.620 
modes you can think about these in a few
different<00:00:19.470> ways<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:20.189> right<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:21.270> great<00:00:21.510> way

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
different ways all right one great way

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.779 
different ways all right one great way
to<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:21.900> about<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.680> your<00:00:23.310> CEO

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that mode that thing we're like hey that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.250 
that mode that thing we're like hey that
fence<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.450> needs<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.720> built<00:01:18.870> let's<00:01:19.110> talk

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
fence that needs to be built let's talk

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.300 
fence that needs to be built let's talk
about<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> second<00:01:19.980> what<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.160> we<00:01:20.220> need

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about that for a second what do we need

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
about that for a second what do we need
to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.940> done<00:01:21.210> okay<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.050> CEO

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
mode and then worker bee mode is where

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
mode and then worker bee mode is where
you're<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.050> here's<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.110> blueprint<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you're like here's a blueprint for the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.820 
you're like here's a blueprint for the
fence<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.690> need<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.680> here's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
fence you know we need we there here's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.280 
fence you know we need we there here's
our<00:01:31.979> here's<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.630> materials<00:01:33.630> list<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.110> need<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
our here's our materials list we need to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
our here's our materials list we need to
take<00:01:34.410> this<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> store<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.010> get<00:01:35.130> these<00:01:35.280> things

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
take this to store to get these things

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
take this to store to get these things
and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:36.900> done<00:01:37.110> by
