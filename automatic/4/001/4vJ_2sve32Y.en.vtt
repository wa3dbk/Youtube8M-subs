00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hi, I'm here today to explain how 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.380
 speaking of him nothing of kitty head 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.360
 using not be poor do not be nervous 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.000
 It will work for you that will work 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.130
 You have a crazy idea to do this. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 this kitten puxadinho I hope 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 you win like that and started to enjoy 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 There are several ways 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 can be drawn with black pencil 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 common may be a lapse in the WM or 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 a lot of people like to do outlined 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 with the fastest approach of all 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.380
 which is the liquid eyeliner and in my case 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 my favorite is the eyeliner and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.090
 religion and even goal of caio rangel 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.610
 for who does not know it is so looks 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.500
 I do not know if it will to see very well but 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 he is a tablet that does not play is a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 duckling walked in folder can also be 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 called 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.629
 their coaches could they have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 a little brush together 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.870
 I used it once but I did not like it 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 very 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.590
 so I advise Leandro advise 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.159
 here because it is easier it will not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.869
 to stain your dead he is when I 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.590
 say it's a little easier to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.460
 remove the eyeliner but it is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 more expensive 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 he understands that too only if Troupe 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 some for George's improvement also in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.110
 brush 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.520
 for me the best is the so choradinho 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.250
 team can be a bit bigger a bit 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 the smaller you can buy half in some 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 that without that type of brush also more 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 This one I found very thick to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 outlined will condemn none and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 pretty 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 I prefer the right bevelled brush then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.500
 to draw is not a very thing 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.060
 mysterious and always looking down 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.280
 because looking down has a notion 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.280
 largest throughout Europe want 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.080
 both he and joel like pencils 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 anything is fact 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.030
 a tip for anyone who has difficulty in 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.580
 tracing is to make the normal tracing a 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.110
 pencil to make it look feminine 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.250
 for example only goes over with a 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.910
 eyeliner area 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.370
 Okay then looking down I 'm going 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.900
 pick up a line is always to pull the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 Look here I like to talk about the year 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 from the outer corner to the inside because 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.350
 in the outer corner today just beginning 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.330
 the ride will be a bit thicker and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.190
 in the inner corner you have to tune 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.930
 then there until arriving at the convention of 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.860
 yesterday, more or less, it does not take a 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.610
 gun in hand 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.190
 the kaboul module to support the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.950
 elbow on some surface 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:51.400
 If your team walking in the table 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 ideal to be able to do the dna 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 Okay, I'll do it fine, right from the start. 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:08.160
 I'll be back as soon as I have 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.160
 need this 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.849
 O 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.600
 who wants to sit with the brush 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.340
 also bevelled and has no eyeliner 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.290
 gel can use a liquid 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.120
 brush in the little brush that comes in the one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.120
 eyeliner is here I just touching 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.680
 and here we say I like to look 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 down and do so 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:53.620
 it ends up in this band but here goes 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.630
 practice over time we will 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.630
 discover our own mothers 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.930
 the tapas truks 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.090
 and condemned the same way and the senator is 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.070
 very close which is very good 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.300
 training not let your eye so one 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.250
 little fallen as mine has already mediated 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.150
 right us and thicken one more here 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 a little 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:37.920
 I'm going to give a thicker give a 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.830
 finish here taken together with the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.830
 right eyelash line 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.629
 and one thing has nothing is not going to come out 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.190
 perfect first I took a lot 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.220
 time to be able to draw a line 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.990
 Then I had no dread time. 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.060
 He is not going to leave, yes, wonderful. 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.979
 first will not be my first 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.009
 rubber wiped why ever 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.780
 practice or teach how I said nothing 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.780
 amuse that little man 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.120
 asked 2 outlines are 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.550
 practically ready now to do the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.130
 kitten 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.599
 a tip that is worth gold is this group here 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.729
 O 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.190
 until a while ago i used andrÃ© santos 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.500
 like traction is the skin itself hurts 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.830
 microphone is the best choice for your 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.009
 for myself I'll get nothing 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.949
 so they were not very big 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.030
 provided that this part is intact 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:10.690
 now we imagine a line in the list 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:18.669
 end of the lashes to the eyebrow and 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:21.789
 Paste O or I can not know if I'm 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.800
 managing to approach very well may 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.770
 Lightweight collar not to hurt too much 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.780
 shouted contested because in heaven and only 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.819
 will go over 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.819
 Here I've done yet 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.800
 right 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.590
 then only tomorrow here with the other trace 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:59.590
 to leave a little bit thicker but 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:01.630
 will leave well and now only remove ready 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.110
 It has never been so simple. 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:10.530
 Look, he was very well. 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.530
 right hit 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.390
 I thought I was very sure he 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:25.710
 it was mid afternoon 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:25.710
 Then I'll pull and roll the little bit 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.500
 nor happened here and citizenship was not 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.780
 a little sprig picks up the swab 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:39.410
 water all that can be water 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.520
 but it is something that removes and here 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.520
 I 'm just kidding myself. 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.419
 only the good defeat river so that's what I 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.370
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:54.150
 I have helped you to make yourself and 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:57.790
 kitten eyeliner that worked 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:00.510
 and I want to say that I have also watched 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:04.350
 is apologizing for any error 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.350
 starting is normal
