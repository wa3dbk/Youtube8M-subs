00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
as a sweat gland that secretes chemical

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
as a sweat gland that secretes chemical

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
substances into ducts that either lead

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.319 
substances into ducts that either lead
to<00:00:57.870> organs<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> body

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.750 

that's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> exocrine<00:01:04.199> gland<00:01:04.820> EXO<00:01:05.820> CR<00:01:06.650> ine<00:01:07.760> EXO

that's the exocrine gland EXO CR ine EXO
means<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> type<00:01:11.310> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
means out of and these are the type of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
means out of and these are the type of
glands<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.299> ducts<00:01:14.240> now<00:01:15.240> what's<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
glands that have ducts now what's the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.719 
glands that have ducts now what's the
type<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> gland<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.770> does<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> duct

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
type of gland that does not have a duct

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840 
type of gland that does not have a duct
and<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.720> makes<00:01:19.259> secretions<00:01:19.950> directly<00:01:20.549> into

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and that makes secretions directly into

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.280 
and that makes secretions directly into
the<00:01:20.970> bloodstream

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.340 

well<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.460> endocrine<00:01:28.090> gland<00:01:28.450> II<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
well that's the endocrine gland II and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.770 
well that's the endocrine gland II and
do<00:01:29.680> CR<00:01:30.690> ine<00:01:31.720> endo<00:01:32.500> again<00:01:32.830> means<00:01:33.130> within<00:01:33.780> now

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
do CR ine endo again means within now

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.050 
do CR ine endo again means within now
there's<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.110> word<00:01:35.350> part<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:36.010> refers<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.550> glens

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
there's a word part that refers to glens

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.200 
there's a word part that refers to glens
and<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.540> word<00:01:37.780> part<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.290> again<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
and that word part is again the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.260 
and that word part is again the
combining<00:01:40.660> form<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.350> adeno<00:01:42.190> ad<00:01:43.050> en<00:01:44.050> /<00:01:44.860> o<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.610> so

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
combining form is adeno ad en / o and so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.810 
combining form is adeno ad en / o and so
pretty<00:01:46.840> much<00:01:47.050> any<00:01:47.320> pathology<00:01:47.830> or<00:01:48.340> procedure

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
pretty much any pathology or procedure

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.910 
pretty much any pathology or procedure
relating<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.600> gland<00:01:49.870> is<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.560> use<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
relating to gland is going to use the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.310 
relating to gland is going to use the
binding<00:01:51.220> form<00:01:51.520> adeno<00:01:52.270> there<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:52.990> some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
binding form adeno there are some

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.320 
binding form adeno there are some
pathologies<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.040> procedures<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
pathologies and procedures in the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.590 
pathologies and procedures in the
chapter<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.160> these<00:01:57.160> all<00:01:57.430> use<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.940> suffixes

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
chapter and these all use the suffixes

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.170 
chapter and these all use the suffixes
you<00:01:58.780> learned<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.200> chapter<00:01:59.620> 1<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.280> these<00:02:00.940> should

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
you learned in chapter 1 so these should

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.210 
you learned in chapter 1 so these should
be<00:02:01.210> really<00:02:01.600> easy<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.410> learn<00:02:02.560> as<00:02:02.860> long

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
be really easy for you to learn as long

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.580 
be really easy for you to learn as long
as<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.610> remember<00:02:03.850> those<00:02:04.180> suffixes<00:02:04.900> that's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
as you remember those suffixes that's

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.320 
as you remember those suffixes that's
why<00:02:05.830> again<00:02:05.979> those<00:02:06.370> suffixes<00:02:06.970> are<00:02:07.150> so

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
why again those suffixes are so

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.550 
why again those suffixes are so
important<00:02:07.930> because<00:02:07.990> they're<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
important because they're going to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.710 
important because they're going to
appear<00:02:08.920> again<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.369> again<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.060> I'm<00:02:10.360> going<00:02:10.660> to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
appear again and again so I'm going to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.360 
appear again and again so I'm going to
quiz<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.020> over<00:02:11.440> these<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.890> let's<00:02:12.070> see<00:02:12.220> if<00:02:12.250> you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
quiz you over these and let's see if you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.250 
quiz you over these and let's see if you
can<00:02:12.670> come<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:12.910> with<00:02:13.090> them<00:02:15.690> okay<00:02:16.690> first<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.170> all

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
can come up with them okay first of all

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
can come up with them okay first of all
what<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> term<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.250> would<00:02:18.580> mean<00:02:18.790> the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
shows you the chapter that each body

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.830 
shows you the chapter that each body
systems<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.950> should<00:04:59.010> know<00:04:59.580> the<00:05:00.300> names<00:05:00.570> of

systems in you should know the names of

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.260 
systems in you should know the names of
these<00:05:00.930> body<00:05:01.230> systems<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.070> what<00:05:02.370> they<00:05:02.550> do<00:05:02.610> that

these body systems and what they do that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.440 
these body systems and what they do that
is<00:05:03.450> what<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.780> major<00:05:03.990> functions<00:05:04.590> are<00:05:05.450> you
