00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello everyone welcome to the recipes 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.520
 of Carlos Hard today we are going to do 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.100
 strawberry jam the ingredients that 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.730
 we are going to need they are going to be 250 grams 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.039
 of sugar 250 grams of strawberry washed and 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.749
 if the green part on top and a 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.240
 trickle of lemon juice this equals 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.279
 to look at the juice of half a lemon 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.450
 well the first step is going to be cut 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.450
 each strawberry in four pieces 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.750
 Well, we already have all the strawberries 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.760
 cut 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.450
 well now we have to put all the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.070
 Strawberries cut in a saucepan 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.990
 then let's put the trickle 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.100
 of lemon 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.100
 and the sugar 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.940
 Now let's light the fire and let's go 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 to move everything 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.760
 fire at the beginning do not apply to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.940
 maximum because what we want is for the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.220
 strawberry release all the water and so 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.610
 I will follow the jam and not caramelize 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 the sugar 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.700
 as you can see the strawberry is already releasing 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 all the water 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.759
 it is very important that at the beginning you go 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.859
 very well the liquid but if there is a 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.110
 little sugar on the walls to 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.780
 that is integrated into it in this kind of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.729
 animal we are already doing and then we do not know 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.140
 caramelize because if we have one left 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.909
 little sugar on the wall of the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.289
 pan and then carameliza emito 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.380
 then we will find pieces of 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.969
 candy in the jam remember not to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 we have a very high fire for example 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.540
 I have it in the number of nine of the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.820
 twelve that I have 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.290
 every time the strawberry is jumping more and more 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.550
 liquid 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.050
 well then when you see that you have everything 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.820
 this liquid and when you see that the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.470
 party expels no more liquid 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.760
 begins to reduce what we have to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.980
 to do is lower the intensity of the fire 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.660
 I'm going to put it in number 4 of the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.040
 12 that I have and we're going to have to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.040
 leave for about 15 10 minutes 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 good jam already takes about 18 minutes 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 of simmering and you're ready 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 in this case I have to leave more 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.810
 15 minutes time because strawberries 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.000
 they had enough water then what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.319
 we will do will be to take the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.670
 jam we're going to put them in a 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.670
 container that resists heat 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.050
 mineral gives me I like that the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.750
 bits are smaller so with 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.790
 some rods what we are going to do is 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.120
 crush a little bit and move that fast 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.730
 so that they undo a little 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 strawberries as you can see the jam 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.650
 now it's pretty liquid then what 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.130
 what we are going to do is to leave it a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.390
 minimum of one hour in the refrigerator good 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.160
 well while we wait for the jam 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.020
 cool down let's prepare the pot 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.240
 you in your houses what you can 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.370
 to do is put a boat like this in 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.840
 any other container I'm going to put 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.820
 I'm going to decorate it in a boat like this one 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.950
 yeah if you want to decorate the boat 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.560
 It's very easy and there is also a lot 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.300
 better if you are going to take it somewhere 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.570
 what we are going to need is going to be the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.180
 boat with its lid a rope appointment as 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.700
 this one or a little bit fatter and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.720
 simply paper of this voucher is like 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.670
 paper like that in cardboard 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.780
 what can we get out of the typical bag 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.160
 of buying the USA or also in the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 fast food sometimes have some 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.960
 these sachets or we can also 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.220
 put the typical checkered fabric so that 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.770
 better the paper this has to 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 be as well as wrinkled the first step 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.030
 is going to be putting the lid on the pot 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.530
 and we put the paper 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.950
 and we are going to put the stern little but 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.950
 very hard around 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.680
 and now we had to make a little 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.390
 but good as we do not have list the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.480
 jam I still need that what 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.489
 let's do 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 well the jam is already ready 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.480
 It takes one hour in the fridge 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.509
 As you can see, it is much more solid than 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.280
 before but still it's jam like 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.020
 is homemade is much more liquid than 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.509
 that we buy because it does not have any 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.409
 dye neither stabilizer nor anything 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.849
 chemical 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.849
 Well obviously in this boat 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.950
 ah 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.599
 well, the last step is to present it 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.409
 let's do what he had said before 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:00.689
 we are going to put the lid on him 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.689
 paper and finally the rope 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.380
 good if you liked recipe you can
