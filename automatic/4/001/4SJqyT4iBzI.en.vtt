00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.860
 ah 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 welcome i am santi houses i am 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 illustrator and teacher in the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.520
 jose school I've been working for 10 years 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 with the study and that has led me to 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.780
 have the luck to collaborate with the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.690
 leading companies in the sector 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 marvel and we have been lucky too 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 to do character creation and design 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.830
 of scenarios for video games we are 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.210
 here gathered to throw a cable with 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.140
 this workshop that we have prepared from 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.140
 creation of pets 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 the first thing to start this 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.200
 course-workshop we will define what 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 we understand by pets are not only 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.280
 those pets that run 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 for our houses but we 're going to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.350
 talk about those characters that are 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.880
 protagonists and give identity to companies 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.440
 sports teams events we are going to catch 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.300
 the secrets of the drawing and we're going to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 divert so that you understand 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.740
 what are the best tools for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 start sketching those figures those 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 pets when we explain what are 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.710
 the best methods and secrets for 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 that the characters are nice and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 know how to reach the spectators what 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 Next thing we will do is see which 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 are the best objects or which of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 they are likely to convert into 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.500
 pet what are we going to do first of 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.390
 everything is to present yourself to those that are the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 authentic the real tools 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 of the drawing are the basic forms 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 geometric and we have brought them to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.990
 present you, we are going to work with you 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 square 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.030
 the triangle and with the circle all 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.190
 you are quite familiar with them 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
 surely but what we are going to do is 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.010
 go a little further and we will try to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.950
 with 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.190
 and control them when we draw a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 square right away we have the need 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.420
 of making a stable form 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.120
 fixed robust when instead we draw 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.250
 a triangle we get closer to a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 sense of direction even 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 verticality last we have the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.620
 circle the circle is a very 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 Nice all rounded shapes 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.730
 They convey a feeling of softness 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.560
 once we have become familiar with these 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.810
 basic ways what we're going to try 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 It is always to give them volume and even 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.750
 combine them as the case of this with 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.440
 where with we look at a circle and a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.590
 triangle or the case of this sphere for 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.600
 it is important to familiarize yourself with 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.980
 representation systems 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.290
 volumetric that no one is afraid of 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.200
 fixed perspective that is very simple 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.060
 do the projection of a cube or join a 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.489
 circle and a triangle and revolutionized 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.230
 what applications do they have this once 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 we face in the real world and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.510
 figure drawing and representation 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 these tools are going to help us 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 synthesize much more complex forms 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 especially in a way that we can 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.930
 understand them 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.660
 let's start with an exercise 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.820
 simple let's try to understand a 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.520
 complex organic and from there 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.410
 we will try to get a funny pet 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.410
 For this we are going to look for a reference 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.920
 I will try to draw a crocodile from 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.819
 zero can seem 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.500
 a small big challenge but using the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.020
 shapes simple geometries we will see that 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.360
 it is very easy to synthesize it and understand it 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.970
 let's first the voice be and we're going to 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.730
 try to reduce these forms to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.080
 simple elements first a circle 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 to describe his skull 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.640
 the next triangles we have one for 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.250
 the upper jaw and another for 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.250
 lower jaw fixed in the nose 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.030
 another small triangle and for the eyes 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.069
 two small triangles we will do the same 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.040
 for the union of the neck a triangle 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.840
 more from here we have the the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.810
 forgiveness scheme with which we are going to 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.880
 face the rest of the drawing 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.989
 We will use the image as a reference 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.959
 let's synthesize and start to give 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.910
 a little grace and life to our 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.520
 character taking reference to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.950
 and following the model scheme 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.810
 construction of the basic forms 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.639
 fixes we have the triangle triangle 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.050
 with what we had built our eyes 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.450
 the triangle of the upper jaw 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.670
 let's give it a little texture the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.220
 line 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.990
 and we followed with the teeth something very 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.450
 characteristic whenever it faces and 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.790
 natural salt try to identify what is 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.070
 the most characteristic part of that 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.170
 character or from that object another triangle 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.420
 for the lower jaw itself system 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.850
 and the neck if there are any fan of the 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.100
 crocodiles we already have a pet 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.990
 you can cheer him up a little with two 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.710
 circles it is very easy to give it one more air 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.230
 beach, then even put a tail or 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.990
 draw its texture but the origin have 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.240
 been that circle and those triangles now 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.550
 we will do the opposite we are going to open 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.860
 a new image and we will make the path 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.590
 inverse this time we will not use the 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.760
 reference but we will try to create 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.160
 something from nothing 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.960
 using precisely those forms 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.020
 simple geometric we choose a 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.860
 tool for sketching and let's face 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:32.510
 something that yes they are defined by figures 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.850
 geometric very very very 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.470
 as for example a vehicle represent 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.170
 a memory vehicle or try 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.750
 turn it from scratch into the cartoon 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.300
 that can be a pet then in a 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.900
 work that seems complex but let's go 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.640
 to think we have a space for 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.220
 cabin our vehicle 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.510
 I probably need an engine and 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.400
 You probably also need a 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.500
 cargo space that vehicle needs 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.330
 some element of locomotion with 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.120
 We extend the lace of the figures are 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.920
 flat figures all circles now 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.060
 let's give them a simple volume 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.030
 line we can determine the space that 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.550
 will give volume to our vehicle more 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.710
 circles with which we bet and 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.930
 we will work the interior with a shape 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.770
 more square some triangles for the 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.570
 windows and others for the ailerons let's go 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.490
 to define this drawing we change from 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.890
 tool and we started to pass it to 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.460
 clean let's start by giving it a little 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.460
 of character 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.870
 and following the genetic forms 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.020
 simple that we have drawn in the 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.379
 lace we can start to build 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.150
 our vehicle practically everything 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.389
 we can draw what we can 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.719
 synthesize first in this way not 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.889
 it will be much easier to face 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.689
 any topic 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.490
 we have to train the look to be 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.319
 able to recognize what those are 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.389
 simple ways with which then 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.710
 we can build the objects that is a 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.830
 fundamental part of the work of the 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.830
 cartoonist 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.599
 and here we have our car the number 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.610
 a good one this has been all for today 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.099
 we hope you have fun and 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.080
 remember the most important thing to know 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:24.020
 you want to transmit with your pet and 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.639
 try to look for that simple way that 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.530
 connect with the viewers and say 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.020
 what you want to transmit 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.060
 with it synthesize it and create a way 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.240
 pretty and fun to connect with 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.539
 spectators and remember to draw too 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.159
 much and upload all your works to 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:42.159
 www and here we paint all the points
