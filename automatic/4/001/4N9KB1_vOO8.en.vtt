00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I'm a grandson. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.150
 Silva and welcome here is one more 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.309
 channel video the android game like you 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.379
 can you see I'm playing here just like 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 adventures 2 with however I am playing 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.070
 sonic adventure the two in the emulator 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 sega dreamcast for android plus one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 console and 128 bits in order to rotate with 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 success on our beloved android as 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 you can see it up well but with 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.210
 some graphic flaws 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.140
 It might be that it's perfect from my 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.379
 Bills but I find it difficult because I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.090
 I have tested this same regulator views 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.280
 to get down on the sega dreamcast of pc and roda 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.590
 that same game quietly 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.859
 then it might be the fact that 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.410
 regulator is rotated 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 so we do not have the right to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.479
 require so much of it so you can 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.520
 see here 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.540
 usually serious failures happen 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.439
 even here it is in the parts that only 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 run 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:25.860
 then you have to return charts one 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:28.229
 little faster but at the same time 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 play cool as long as you can ignore 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 these graphical glitches and be aware of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.380
 that the regulator is in the foot phase 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.840
 I do not think it's kind of alpha for even 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:56.130
 Can you set something up on him? 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:58.439
 God bless you and in case you set anything up 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 even a light option set it up 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.850
 says no settings for now 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.250
 does not imply that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.209
 seen updates and these permissions 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.210
 there are some options there to adjust the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.740
 emulator and maybe 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.340
 to free network failure but this graphic 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
 I can only play, I'm calm 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.300
 doing well here because they do not 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.640
 I get a good gameplay while with 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.640
 fear but it's kind of natural 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.320
 we have the checkpoints here but remembering 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.890
 that the population is not pirate 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.530
 provided you have a console and the game 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.490
 And you have the console, right? 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.570
 next to the game originally in my 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.660
 situation 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:57.560
 in my case I have this game bought 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.300
 on steam my pc is quiet then 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.170
 who accompanies me 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.800
 whoever accompanies the group soon knows 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.100
 that this game is my dream and favorite of 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.840
 all people of all generations 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:20.090
 including 2d and 3d 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:25.900
 but if it was it is to differentiate the 2d I prefer 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:37.910
 the first dream and 13 of 25 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:41.150
 then there cast in the history of free 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.460
 Article referring to the regulator in mouth 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.540
