 coins and now we go with the video hello 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.960
 good of all here we are your new 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.390
 video is from that presentation of a 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.980
 new series called catches the million 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.260
 for karts the country of which vast 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.880
 series is a television program in the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.940
 Spanish television I do not know if also in 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.249
 South America is and well, it's about 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.929
 who are contestants who go to the program 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:40.329
 and they give them to the top a million 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.399
 euros then they need eight 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.229
 questions or ten and well then they give you 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.280
 Variety answer you propose several 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.109
 answers and they have to fill in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.670
 there are no have to go choosing 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.679
 answers that I seem to be the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.999
 better and betting the money on each 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.100
 answer that you think is the best 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.659
 not the truth is that good in this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.510
 case I would do it with a million 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.949
 coins and it would be to ten questions not for 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.289
 when you get an idea of what the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.260
 background but a thing like that is not good will be 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.120
 this the white thing we will have the questions 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 on the black screens we have the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.620
 answers that I will propose and there we have 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 the amount you had during the 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.840
 program if you fail a question then in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.910
 the one that you have put in this case because if 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.860
 It is giving from the day you lose not 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.980
 and well, yes 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.150
 so for example fire sound a question 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.770
 in which you had bet all your money 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.100
 obviously the chapter will be 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 finished and you will have lost that is the is what 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.080
 game not the truth that I would like 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 4.0 if it were in itself may be good for 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.979
 that we both have the cam would be 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.630
 going down interesting and we go for the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.390
 question will be about football about 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.760
 feedback and about my soccer channel not 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.140
 in real life I do not want to do 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.310
 many questions since there are many good 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.860

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.750
