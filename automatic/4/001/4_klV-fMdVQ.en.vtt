00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.040
 all right 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.620
 by mercantile custom the term for the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.529
 payment a settlement are eight days 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.020
 able if on the ninth day they have not 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.880
 canceled one day must be canceled 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.619
 salary for each day of delay from 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.220
 of the resignation date or of the 9th day either 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.500
 Mary crisis in the city of Bogota 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.850
 one or the other nothing what you are 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.390
 saying is correct under the argument 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.920
 of the mercantile custom not the term 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.370
 mercantile custom as its name what 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.210
 he says is what is habituated or what is 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.510
 It is used by merchants 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.010
 merchant and another merchant that what 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.140
 we see at the beginning of the code of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.449
 trade that one of the sources of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.480
 right or forgiveness one of the sources of 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.460
 commercial law 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.500
 the merchant custom let's remember 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 small sources of law that the law 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.510
 the jurisprudence the doctrine the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 mercantile custom etcetera but in 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.330
 labor law does not apply custom 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 mercantile does not apply a custom 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.070
 if we want to call him that because 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.100
 because the rules when the law covers 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 Any doubt we can not apply 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.539
 sources so auxiliary way 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 let us remember that the sources of law 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.479
 they are auxiliary tools to who is going to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.310
 apply the law because it first applies 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.080
 the constitution in the law 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.619
 when there are gaps in the constitution of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.250
 the law is that we go to other sources 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.600
 as custom as jurisprudence 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.340
 like doctrine like analogy or by 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.960
 there the lawyers that are 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.680
 listening will remember over there 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.860
 his first classes of 1st and 2nd semester 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.070
 ok but I repeat in the labor law not 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 would apply to the custom then how much 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.420
 it's time to pay a settlement 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.190
 that's the great question of Maria Cristina 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.590
 marÃ­ a cris in bogota several crisis 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.770
 textually the labor code does not have 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.800
 no article that expressly states the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.590
 employer will have so many days 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.320
 hours so many weeks and so on to pay 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 a liquidation not expressly not what 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.650
 he says but if he lets it see very clearly 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.010
 Article 65 of the labor code because 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.840
 because Article 65 says or starts more 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 or less the employer 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.120
 that upon termination of the contract 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.730
 work not pay the salary benefits 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.060
 social organizations must pay a day of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.880
 salary for each day of delay 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.209
 well it says more or less the article 65 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.750
 I repeat the termination of the contract if 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.000
 you are in debt you will not be paid a penalty 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 I love you is saying the rule that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.580
 the contract ends immediately 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.190
 to pay ok now get to that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.680
 situation in which the contract under 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.959
 any situation ends e 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.930
 immediately we are paying then in 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.069
 no part is almost think that it is done 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.650
 it's almost illogical impossible then 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:37.150
 as article 65 tells us about a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.069
 sanction or we are facing sanctions in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.840
 the penalties have to be of 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.739
 half the bad faith to be able to apply 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.200
 a correct sanction or a serious omission 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.920
 etcetera then the supreme court of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.410
 justice work room 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.230
 jurisprudentially eye a source of 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.390
 court case law 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.470
 supreme- work room that has said 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.910
 If the company notices 30 days before 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.360
 that the contract ended fixed and going to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.490
 finish the company you already know that the date 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.230
 of completion and has all that time 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.060
 to get the silver and have the list ready 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.709
 settlement for the day the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.980
 final day that day or the next day be 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.620
 paying if the worker without being 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.419
 forced to submit a letter of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.810
 notice saying he works up to such 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.520
 date the company knows in advance and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 have the time to look for the silver and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.540
 make the liquidation and have it ready 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.060
 for that final day or the next day to be 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.050
 paying then in those two situations 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.900
 when the employer knows in advance the 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.360
 exact date of termination in that case 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.040
 the judges of the republic org uriz 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.190
 prudence of the supreme court- be 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.770
 workers do not pardon the moratorium sanction 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.270
 If several days pass and the employer 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.490
 delay in paying the final settlement 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.410
 because because I knew the date of 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.820
 termination 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.920
 jurisprudential principle of good 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.250
 let's go to the second case 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.230
 I do not know today is Tuesday, December 3 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.780
 everything is emerging under a lot 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.580
 normality and today a worker arrives at 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.340
 6 o'clock in the afternoon and they call me boss 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.560
 I work there until then as well 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.740
 I do not work anymore tomorrow I do not come until 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.410
 Then as it is popularly said, it took me 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.570
 with the pants down I did not know 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.050
 as a businessman that today I 'm going to 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.010
 resign today at five thirty of the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.410
 late 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.960
 at five o'clock in the afternoon I realize that 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.910
 a worker is stealing from me 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 five and a half I do diligence for 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.540
 discharges and after susan ailment 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.420
 I release at six in the afternoon I say 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.370
 sir I do not believe you was not convincing in 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.050
 your diligence releases take your letter 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.840
 of dismissal end that in those 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.600
 situations in resignations or in dismissals or 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.760
 untimely terminations or the 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.650
 worker of the company knew the date 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.220
 of completion was somewhat surprising 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.950
 something surprising is in that case that has 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.500
 said the good court nobody knew no 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.450
 we can pretend that same day 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.430
 at midnight you have to pay a 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.480
 final settlement of benefits because 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.640
 nobody knew 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.130
 in that case the court says good 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.400
 Let's do a little bit of sight 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.730
 fat with article 65 the code 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.690
 work and let's go where the blind eye 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:30.610
 until the next 15 or 30 closest that 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.300
 are the usual payment dates in 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:38.080
 biweekly forms is no later than 15 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.000
 closest or the 30th closest that day 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.060
 have to pay her final settlement and I 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.370
 as he did not apply the moratorium sanction 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.960
 because because with retirement or a layoff 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.750
 untimely nobody knew 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.120
 we have the Indians ready not about 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.669
 digits for the employer to get the 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.460
 silver make the liquidation and so on 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.340
 etcetera is that the situation then 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.550
 Maria Crisis Nowhere 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.530
 we talked about 89 days done did you know the 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.390
 date they have to be paying that day 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.510
 the next day if it was a retirement a layoff 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:13.630
 untimely pay no later than 15 o 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.980
 the nearest 30 because otherwise 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.350
 the judge and then apply the penalty 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.330
 moratorium and the moratorium sanction is 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.630
 would count then if they are applied 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:27.300
 from the day after the termination 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.300
 of the work contract ok
