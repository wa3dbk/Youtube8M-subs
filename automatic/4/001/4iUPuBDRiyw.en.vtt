you think they should change watch your
things<00:01:47.729> overpowered<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> stuff<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
things overpowered and stuff like that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.039 
things overpowered and stuff like that
and<00:01:49.549> personally<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.729> he<00:01:51.090> should<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and personally I think he should a you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
and personally I think he should a you
should<00:01:52.259> numb<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> shotguns<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
should numb down the shotguns the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
should numb down the shotguns the
shotgun<00:01:54.329> range<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> damage<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.590> too

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
shotgun range of the damage is not too

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.350 
shotgun range of the damage is not too
bad<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> range<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.119> they

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
bad it's just the range at which they

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.459 
bad it's just the range at which they
can<00:01:57.479> shoot<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:58.280> butt<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.670> also<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.869> never
